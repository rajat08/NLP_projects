{"id": "144832", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=144832", "title": "I Love Lucy", "text": "I Love Lucy\n\nI Love Lucy is an American television sitcom that originally ran on CBS from October 15, 1951 to May 6, 1957, with a total of 180 half-hour episodes spanning six seasons (including the 'lost' original pilot and Christmas episode). The show starred Lucille Ball, her real-life husband Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, and William Frawley. It followed the life of Lucy Ricardo (Ball), a middle-class housewife in New York City, who either concocted plans with her best friends (Vance & Frawley) to appear alongside her bandleader husband Ricky Ricardo (Arnaz) in his nightclub, or tried numerous schemes to mingle with, or be a part of show business. After the series ended in 1957, a modified version continued for three more seasons with 13 one-hour specials; it ran from 1957 to 1960. It was first known as \"The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show\" and later in reruns as \"The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour\".\n\n\"I Love Lucy\" became the most-watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, and it was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (an accomplishment later matched only by \"The Andy Griffith Show\" in 1968 and \"Seinfeld\" in 1998). As of 2011, episodes of the show have been syndicated in dozens of languages across the world and remain popular with an American audience of 40 million each year. A colorized version of its Christmas episode attracted more than 8 million viewers when CBS aired it in prime time in 2013, 62 years after the show premiered; CBS has aired two to three colorized episodes each year since then, once at Christmas and again in the spring.\n\nThe show, which was the first scripted television program to be shot on 35mm film in front of a studio audience, won five Emmy Awards and received numerous nominations and honors. It was the first show ever to feature an ensemble cast. It is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms in history. In 2012, it was voted the 'Best TV Show of All Time' in a survey conducted by ABC News and \"People\" magazine.\n\nOriginally set in an apartment building in New York City, \"I Love Lucy\" centers on Lucy Ricardo (Lucille Ball) and her singer/bandleader husband Ricky Ricardo (Desi Arnaz), along with their best friends and landlords Fred Mertz (William Frawley) and Ethel Mertz (Vivian Vance). During the second season, Lucy and Ricky have a son named Ricky Ricardo Jr. (\"Little Ricky\"), whose birth was timed to coincide with Ball's real-life birth of her son Desi Arnaz Jr.\n\nLucy is naïve and ambitious, with an undeserved zeal for stardom and a knack for getting herself and her husband into trouble whenever Lucy yearns to make it in show business. The Ricardos' best friends, Fred and Ethel, are former vaudevillians and this only strengthens Lucy's resolve to prove herself as a performer. Unfortunately, she has few marketable performance skills. She does not seem to be able to carry a tune or play anything other than off-key renditions of songs such as \"Glow Worm\" on the saxophone, and many of her performances devolve into disaster. However, to say she is completely without talent would be untrue, as on occasion, she is shown to be a good dancer and a competent singer. She is also at least twice offered contracts by television or film companies—first in \"The Audition\" when she replaces an injured clown in Ricky's act, and later in Hollywood when she dances for a studio benefit using a rubber Ricky dummy as her dancing partner.\n\nThe show provided Ball ample opportunity to display her considerable skill at clowning and physical comedy. Character development was not a major focus of early sitcoms, so little was offered about her life before the show. A few episodes mentioned that she was born in Jamestown, New York (Lucille Ball's real-life home town), later corrected to \"West\" Jamestown, that she graduated from Jamestown High School, that her maiden name was \"McGillicuddy\" (indicating a Scottish or Irish ethnicity at least on her father's side, though she once mentioned her grandmother was Swedish; there are sizable Irish and Swedish communities in Jamestown), and that she met Ricky on a boat cruise with her friend from an agency she once worked for. Her family was absent, other than occasional appearances by her scatter-brained mother (Kathryn Card), who could never get Ricky's name right. Lucy also exhibited many traits that were standard for female comedians at the time, including being secretive about her age and true hair color, and being careless with money, along with being somewhat materialistic, insisting on buying new dresses and hats for every occasion and telling old friends that she and Ricky were wealthy. She was also depicted as a devoted housewife and attentive mother. As part of Lucy's role was to care for her husband, she stayed at home and took care of the household chores while her husband Ricky went to work. During the post war era Lucy took jobs outside of the home but in these jobs she was portrayed as being inept outside of her usual domestic duties.\n\nLucy's husband, Ricky Ricardo, is an up-and-coming Cuban American singer and bandleader with an excitable personality. His patience is frequently tested by his wife's antics trying to get into showbiz, and exorbitant spending on clothes or furniture. When exasperated, he often reverts to speaking rapidly in Spanish. As with Lucy, not much is revealed about his past or family. Ricky's mother (played by actress Mary Emery) appears in two episodes; in another Lucy mentions that he has five brothers. Ricky also mentions that he had been \"practically raised\" by his uncle Alberto (who was seen during a family visit to Cuba), and that he had attended the University of Havana.\n\nAn extended flashback segment in the 1957 episode \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana\" of \"The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show\" filled in numerous details of how Lucy and Ricky met and how Ricky came to the United States. The story, at least insofar as related to newspaper columnist Hedda Hopper, is that the couple met in Havana when Lucy and the Mertzes vacationed there in 1940. Despite his being a university graduate, proficient in English, Ricky is portrayed as a driver of a horse-drawn cab who waits for fares at a pier where tourists arrive by ship. Ricky is hired to serve as one of Lucy's tour guides and the two fall in love. Having coincidentally also met popular singer Rudy Vallée on the cruise ship, Lucy arranges an audition for Ricky who is hired to be in Vallée's orchestra, thus allowing him to immigrate to the United States on the very ship on which Lucy and the Mertzes were returning. Lucy later states that Ricky played for Vallée only one night before being traded to Xavier Cugat's orchestra.\n\nNote that the extended flashback segment \"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana\" and the story of how Lucy and Ricky met is inconsistent with Season 4, Episode 18 entitled, \"Don Juan and the Starlets\" (1955). In that episode, Lucy mistakenly believes that Ricky stayed out all night after his publicity agent, Ross Elliott, sent him to a movie premiere accompanied by young starlets who were appearing in his movie. As a comeback in the ensuing argument, Lucy bemoans that she made a mistake fifteen years before when Marion Strong asked her if she would like to go on a blind date with a Cuban drummer and she said \"yes.\"\n\nLucy is usually found with her sidekick and best friend Ethel Mertz. A former model from Albuquerque, New Mexico, Ethel tries to relive her glory days in vaudeville. Ricky is more inclined to include Ethel in performances at his nightclub because, unlike Lucy, she can actually sing and dance rather well.\n\nEthel's husband Fred served in World War I, and lived through the Great Depression. He is very stingy with money and is an irascible, no-nonsense type. However, he also shows that he can be a soft touch, especially when it comes to Little Ricky. Fred can also sing and dance and often performs duets with Ethel.\n\nThe Manhattan building they all lived in before their move to Westport, Connecticut, was addressed at a fictional 623 East 68th Street, at first in apartment 4A, then moving to the larger apartment 3B (subsequently re-designated 3D; the Mertzes’ apartment is then numbered 3B), on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In actuality, the addresses go up only to the 500s before the street terminates at the East River.\n\n\nGale Gordon and Bea Benaderet, supporting cast members on \"My Favorite Husband\", were originally approached for the roles of Fred and Ethel, but neither could accept owing to previous commitments. Gordon did appear as a guest star in three episodes, playing Ricky's boss, Mr. Littlefield, in two episodes, and later in an hour-long episode as a civil court judge. Gordon was a veteran from the classic radio days in which he perfected the role of the exasperated character, as in \"Fibber McGee and Molly\" and \"Our Miss Brooks\". He would go on to co-star with Ball in all of her post–\"I Love Lucy\" series (\"The Lucy Show\", \"Here's Lucy\" and \"Life with Lucy\"). Benaderet was a guest star in one episode as elderly Miss Lewis, a neighbor of the Ricardos.\n\nBarbara Pepper (later featured as Doris Ziffel in the series \"Green Acres\") was also considered to play Ethel, but Pepper had been drinking very heavily after the death of her husband, Craig W. Reynolds. Her friendship with Ball dated back to the film \"Roman Scandals\", in which both appeared as Goldwyn Girls. She did, however, turn up in at least nine episodes of \"I Love Lucy\" in bit parts.\n\nMany of the characters' names were after Lucille Ball's family members or close friends; for example, Marion Strong was one of her best friends and roommate for a time in New York, and also set Lucy and Desi up on their first date. Lillian Appleby was a teacher of Lucy's when she was in an amateur production on the stage. Pauline Lopus was a childhood friend, Fred was also her brother and grandfather's name. Lucy and Desi had a business manager by the name of Mr. Andrew Hickox, and in the first episode of season 4, called \"The Business Manager\" Lucy and Ricky hire a man named Mr. Hickox.\n\n\nLucille Ball had come to Hollywood after a successful stint as a New York model. She was chosen by Samuel Goldwyn to be one of sixteen Goldwyn Girls to co-star in the picture \"Roman Scandals\" (1933) with film star Eddie Cantor. Enthusiastic and hard-working, Ball had been able to secure film work briefly at the Samuel Goldwyn Studio and Columbia Pictures and then eventually at RKO Radio Pictures. It was at RKO that Ball received steady film work, first as an extra and bit player and eventually working her way up to co-starring roles in feature films and starring roles in second rate B pictures, collectively earning her the nickname \"Queen of the B's\". During her run at RKO, Ball gained the reputation for doing physical comedy and stunts that most other actresses avoided, keeping her steadily employed. In 1940, Lucy met Desi Arnaz, a Cuban bandleader who had just come off a successful run in the 1939–40 Broadway show \"Too Many Girls\". RKO had bought the film rights to the show and cast Ball as Arnaz's love interest in the picture. The duo began a whirlwind courtship leading to their elopement to Connecticut in November 1940. Despite their marriage, however, their careers kept them separated, with Lucy's film work keeping her anchored in Hollywood, while Desi's nightclub engagements with his orchestra kept him on the road.\n\nDespite steadily working in pictures, Lucy's movie career never advanced to the level of a headlining feature-film actress; nevertheless she remained popular with movie audiences. Ball came to the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer after receiving critical acclaim for her starring role in the 1942 Damon Runyon film \"The Big Street\", which bought out her contract. It was at MGM that Ball, who had been a blonde, dyed her hair red to complement the Technicolor features that MGM had planned to use her in. MGM used Ball in a variety of films, but it was her work with funny man Red Skelton in the 1942 film \"DuBarry Was a Lady\" that brought Ball's physical comedy into the forefront, earning her the reputation as \"that crazy redhead\", as Ricky would later call her. Nonetheless, Ball's striking beauty was in sharp contrast to physical antics she did in her films; thus, MGM tried to use her in multiple different film genres that did little to highlight her skills. Given their difficulties in casting her, MGM chose not to renew her contract when it expired in 1946.\n\nBall began working as a free-lancer in films and also began to explore other venues. Before and during World War II, Lucy had made several notable and successful guest appearances on several radio programs, among them Jack Haley's radio show and bandleader Kay Kyser's radio program. These appearances brought Lucy to the attention of CBS, which in 1948 enlisted Ball to star in one of two new half-hour situation comedies in development, \"Our Miss Brooks\" and \"My Favorite Husband\". Choosing the latter, Lucy portrayed Liz Cugat (later anglicized to Cooper), the frustrated and scheming housewife of a Minneapolis banker, played originally by actor Lee Bowman in the series pilot, and later by actor Richard Denning. Based on the novel \"Mr. and Mrs. Cugat\" by Isabel Scott Rorick, \"My Favorite Husband\" was produced by Jess Oppenheimer, and written by Oppenheimer, plus scribes Madelyn Pugh and Bob Carroll Jr. Premiering on July 23, 1948, and sponsored by General Foods, \"Husband\" became a hit for CBS. During the run of the radio program Lucy appeared in two feature films with Bob Hope, \"Sorrowful Jones\" in 1949, and \"Fancy Pants\" in 1950. Both films were box office and critical successes, further cementing Ball's reputation as a top notch first-rate comedian. They also showed her continuing popularity with audiences, enticing CBS to further use her skills.\n\nIn 1950, CBS asked Ball to take \"My Favorite Husband\" to television with co-star Richard Denning. She, however, saw a television show as a great opportunity to work with Desi, so Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much to the dismay of CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. CBS executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a vaudeville act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they performed at Newburgh NY's historic Ritz Theater with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive Harry Ackerman that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks NBC, ABC, and DuMont were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo.\n\nA pilot was ordered and kinescoped in Hollywood in March 1951, which coincided with Lucy's first pregnancy, and the ending of \"Husband\", which aired its last radio show on March 31, 1951. Ball and Arnaz used the same radio team of Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll to create the television series that was named \"I Love Lucy\". After showing the pilot to several advertising agencies, at first with not much luck, CBS was able to sell the series to the Milton H. Biow agency, which was able to convince one of their clients, cigarette giant Philip Morris, to sponsor the show.\n\nDuring the spring and summer of 1951, \"I Love Lucy\" moved into production. Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll began fine-tuning the premise of the show and writing the series' first scripts. The trio had the good graces of having a backlog of storylines from \"My Favorite Husband\" to adapt for use on television. In addition, the series' ensemble cast and crew were assembled. Desi Arnaz retained his orchestra, which was used in the series musical numbers and to score the show's background and transitional music. Arnaz's childhood friend Marco Rizo arranged the music and played the piano for the show, while Wilbur Hatch was used to conduct the orchestra. Two problems arose, however, after Philip Morris signed on to sponsor the show, that would ultimately change the fate of \"I Love Lucy\".\n\nLucy and Desi had originally decided that the series would air on a biweekly basis, much like \"The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show\". Philip Morris, however, was insistent that the show air weekly, thus diminishing the possibility of Lucy continuing her film career alongside a television show. Another problem lay in the fact that Philip Morris wanted the series to originate from New York rather than Hollywood. At the time, most television shows were produced from New York with live broadcasts of the show airing for eastern and Midwest audiences. West Coast viewers were able to view live programs only through low-quality kinescopes, which derived their images by using a 35 mm or 16 mm film camera to record the show from a television monitor. As videotape had not yet been developed, kinescopes seemed to be the only practical means to allow a live show to reach television markets on the West Coast. Complicating matters was that kinescopes were not available for immediate re-broadcast as in 1951 no coast-to-coast cable system was yet in service. Shows had to be sent to Hollywood, which delayed their airings for West Coast audiences by nearly a week. The process operated in the reverse for the few programs that originated live in Hollywood, such as \"The Ed Wynn Show\", thus making blurry kinescopes of these shows the only available print for eastern audiences. Most sponsors, including Philip Morris, found this to be undesirable as most of the television audience lived east of the Mississippi at the time.\n\nAlthough the pilot had been made as a kinescope, for the series itself, the process was rejected. Owing to the impending birth of their first child, both Lucy and Desi insisted on staying in Hollywood and producing the show on film, something a few Hollywood-based series had begun to do. Both CBS and Philip Morris initially balked at the idea, because of the higher cost that filming the show would incur, yet acquiesced only after the couple offered to take a $1,000 a week pay cut in order to cover the additional expense. In exchange, Lucy and Desi demanded, and were given, 80% ownership in the \"I Love Lucy\" films (the other 20% went to producer Jess Oppenheimer who then gave 5% to writer Madelyn Pugh and 5% to writer Bob Carroll Jr.). Shooting the show on film, however, would require that Lucy and Desi become responsible for producing the series themselves. Union agreements at the time stipulated that any production filmed in a studio use film studio employees. CBS staff were television and radio employees and thus fell under different union agreements. Thus, Arnaz reorganized the company he created to manage his orchestra bookings and used it as the corporation that would produce the \"I Love Lucy\" shows. The company was named Desilu, from the combination of both their first names \"Desi\" and \"Lucille\".\n\nThough some television series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, with a laugh track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and \"I Love Lucy\" creator Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy needed to work in front of an audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer were lucky enough to find the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.\n\nAnother component to filming the show came when it was decided to use three 35 mm film cameras to simultaneously film the show. The idea had been pioneered by Ralph Edwards on the game show \"Truth or Consequences\", and had subsequently been used on \"Amos 'n' Andy\" as a way to save money, though \"Amos n' Andy\" did not use an audience. Edwards's assistant Al Simon was hired by Desilu to help perfect the new technique for the series. The process lent itself to the \"Lucy\" production as it eliminated the problem of requiring an audience to view and react to a scene three or four times in order for all necessary shots to be filmed. Multiple cameras would also allow scenes to be performed in sequence, as a play would be, which was unusual at the time for filmed series. Retakes were rare and dialogue mistakes were often played off for the sake of continuity.\n\nBall and Arnaz enlisted the services of Karl Freund, a cinematographer who had worked on such films as \"Metropolis\" (1927), \"Dracula\" (1931), and \"The Good Earth\" (1937), as well as directing \"The Mummy\" (1932), to be the series cinematographer. Although at first Freund did not want anything to do with television, it was the personal plea of the couple that convinced him to take the job.\n\nFreund was instrumental in developing a way to uniformly light the set so that each of the three cameras would pick up the same quality of image. Freund noted that a typical episode (20–22 min.) was shot in about 60 minutes, with one constant concern being the shades-of-gray contrast in the final print, as each stage of transmission and broadcast would exaggerate the contrast. Among other non-standard techniques used in filming the show, cans of paint (in shades ranging from white to medium-gray) were kept on set to \"paint out\" inappropriate shadows and disguise lighting flaws. Freund also pioneered \"flat lighting,\" in which everything is brightly lit to eliminate shadows and the need for endless relighting.\n\nAudience reactions were live, thus creating a far more authentic laugh than the canned laughter used on most filmed sitcoms of the time. Regular audience members were sometimes heard from episode to episode, and Arnaz's distinctive laugh could be heard in the background during scenes in which he did not perform, as well as Ball's mother, DeDe, whose distinctive \"Uh Oh\" could be heard in many of the episodes. In later years, CBS would devise a laugh track from several \"I Love Lucy\" audiences and use them for canned laughter on shows done without a live audience.\n\n\"I Love Lucy\"'s pioneering use of three cameras led to it becoming the standard technique for the production of most sitcoms filmed in front of an audience. Single-camera setups remained the technique of choice for sitcoms that did not use audiences. This led to an unexpected benefit for Desilu during the series's second season when it was discovered that Lucy was pregnant. Not being able to fulfill the show's 39-episode commitment, both Desi and Jess Oppenheimer decided to rebroadcast popular episodes of the series's first season to help give Lucy the necessary rest she needed after she gave birth, effectively allowing fewer episodes to be filmed that season. Unexpectedly the rebroadcasts proved to be ratings winners, effectively giving birth to the rerun, which would later lead to the profitable development of the rerun syndication market.\n\nThe show's original opening and commercial bumpers were animated caricatures of Lucy and Desi. They were designed and animated by MGM character designer and future \"Flintstones\" cartoonist, Gene Hazelton (1917–2005) and were produced secretly under a contract producer William Hanna had secured privately. The program sponsor, Phillip Morris cigarettes was incorporated into many of these sequences, so when \"I Love Lucy\" went into repeats, they were replaced by the now familiar heart logo. However Gene Hazelton's original animation survives, and can be seen in the DVD boxed set as originally presented.\n\nDesilu Productions, jointly owned by Ball and Arnaz, would gradually expand to produce and lease studio space for many other shows. For seasons 1 and 2 (1951–1953), Desilu rented space and filmed \"I Love Lucy\" at General Service Studios, which eventually became known as Hollywood Center Studios. In 1953, it leased the Motion Picture Center at 846 Cahuenga Blvd. in Hollywood, renaming it \"Desilu Studios\", to shoot seasons 3–6 (1953–1957) of \"I Love Lucy\". After 1956, it became known as \"Desilu-Cahuenga Studios\" to avoid confusion with other acquired Desilu locations. In an effort to keep up with the studio's growth, and need for additional sound stages, Desi and Lucy purchased RKO Radio Pictures from General Tire in 1957 for over $6 million, effectively owning the studio where they had started as contract players. Desilu acquired RKO's two studio complexes located on Gower Street in Hollywood, and in Culver City (now part of the Paramount lot and Culver Studios respectively), along with the Culver City back lot nicknamed \"Forty Acres\". The sale was achieved by the duo selling their ownership of the once-thought-worthless \"I Love Lucy\" films back to CBS for over four million dollars.\n\nIn 1962, two years after their marriage dissolved, Lucy bought out Desi's shares of Desilu, becoming the studio's sole owner. She eventually sold off Desilu in 1967 to Gulf+Western, owners of Paramount Pictures. After the sale, Desilu-Cahuenga became a private production company and was known as Ren-Mar Studios till 2010, when it was acquired by the Red Digital Cinema Camera Company and renamed Red Studios – Hollywood.\n\nAs with \"My Favorite Husband\", \"Lucy\" writers decided that the Ricardos needed an older couple to play off of. While performing in \"Husband\", veteran character actors Gale Gordon and Bea Benaderet had played Rudolph and Iris Atterbury, an older, more financially stable couple as Mr. Atterbury had been George Cooper's boss. Ball had initially wanted both actors to reprise their roles on television; however, both were unavailable at the time the show went into production as Benaderet was already playing Blanche Morton on \"The Burns and Allen Show\", and Gordon was under contract by CBS to play Mr. Conklin on both the radio and television versions of \"Our Miss Brooks\".\n\nCasting the Mertzes, as they were now called (the surname taken from a doctor that \"Lucy\" scriptwriter Madelyn Pugh knew as a child in Indianapolis), proved to be a challenge. Ball had initially wanted character actor James Gleason, with whom she appeared in Columbia Pictures film \"Miss Grant Takes Richmond\" (1949), to play Fred Mertz. However, Gleason wanted nearly $3,500 per episode to play the role, a price that was far too high to sustain.\n\nSixty-four-year-old William Frawley, a seasoned vaudevillian and movie character actor with nearly 100 film credits to his name, was a long shot to play Fred Mertz and only came into consideration after he telephoned Ball personally to ask if there was a role for him on her new show. Ball, who had only briefly known Frawley from her days at RKO, suggested him to both Arnaz and CBS. The network objected to the idea of casting Frawley, fearing that his excessive drinking—which was well known in Hollywood—would interfere with a commitment to a live show. Arnaz nonetheless liked Frawley and lobbied hard for him to have the role, even to the point of having Lucy scribes re-tailor the role of Fred Mertz to be a less financially successful and more curmudgeonly (in contrast to Gale Gordon's Mr. Atterbury) character to fit Frawley's persona. CBS relented only after Arnaz contractually bound Frawley to complete sobriety during the production of the show, and reportedly told the veteran actor that if he ever appeared on-set more than once in an intoxicated state he would be fired. Not once during \"Lucy\"'s nine seasons did Frawley's drinking ever interfere with his performance, and over time Arnaz became one of Frawley's few close friends.\n\nCasting the Ethel Mertz character was also some work. One choice was actress Barbara Pepper, who was a close friend of Ball. The two had a long history together, as Pepper had been one of the Goldwyn Girls who came to Hollywood with Lucy in 1933. Pepper was favored by Lucy herself; however, CBS refused on the grounds that Pepper suffered from a drinking problem too, which was far more severe than Frawley's. Nonetheless Pepper did appear in several bit parts during the run of the show.\n\nVivian Vance became a consideration on the recommendation of \"Lucy\" director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in a variety of plays, and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play \"The Voice of the Turtle\" in La Jolla, California. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels that it would be a big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings was lukewarm at best. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an Emmy Award for \"Outstanding Supporting Actress\". Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series \"The Lucy Show\" after the end of \"I Love Lucy\".\n\nVance and Frawley's off-screen relationship was less successful. In spite of this, they were always professional and exhibited exceptional chemistry while performing on the show. In fact, their acrimonious personal relationship may have helped their onscreen marriage be that much funnier. Frawley derisively described Vance's appearance as \"a sack of doorknobs.\" It was reported that Vance, who was 22 years younger than Frawley, was not really keen on the idea that her character Ethel was married to a man that was old enough to be her father. Vance also complained that Frawley's song-and-dance skills were not what they once were. Frawley and Vance would have an adversarial relationship during the entire run of the show.\n\nIn 1957, \"I Love Lucy\" was re-tailored into an hour-long show originally titled \"The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show\" that was to be part of an anthology series called the \"Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse\". The hour-long \"Lucy-Desi\" show was to alternate on a monthly basis with other hour long \"Playhouse\" shows. The new series put a much heavier emphasis on big name guest stars as being part of the plot and although the Mertz characters continued into the new series, their roles became somewhat diminished. Although a lighter workload was welcomed by Frawley, Vance came to somewhat resent the change. Arnaz, in an effort to please Vance, for whom he had much respect, proposed doing a spin-off from \"I Love Lucy\" called \"The Mertzes\". Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so it would be much less likely the two could work together on their \"own\" series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play off of, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in playing more glamorous roles rather than Ethel. In fact, during the thirteen-episode run of the \"Lucy-Desi\" hour-long shows, Vance was given a lot more latitude to look more attractive as Ethel Mertz, something she was denied during the run of the \"I Love Lucy\" episodes. Frawley's resentment of Vance intensified after she declined to do the spin-off show and the two rarely talked to each other outside of their characters' dialogue with one another.\n\nJust before filming the show, Lucy and Desi learned that Lucy was once again pregnant (after multiple miscarriages earlier in their marriage) with their first child, Lucie Arnaz. They filmed the original pilot while Lucy was \"showing\", but did not include any references to the pregnancy in the episode. This was because CBS thought that talk of pregnancy might be in bad taste and because an ad agency told Desi not to show a pregnant woman.\n\nLater, during the second season, Lucy was pregnant again with second child Desi Arnaz Jr., and this time the pregnancy was incorporated into the series' storyline. (Contrary to popular belief, Lucy's pregnancy was not television's first on-screen pregnancy, a distinction belonging to Mary Kay on the late 1940s sitcom \"Mary Kay and Johnny\".)\n\nCBS would not allow \"I Love Lucy\" to use the word \"pregnant\", so \"expecting\" was used instead. In addition, sponsor Philip Morris made the request that Lucy not be seen smoking during the pregnancy episodes. The episode \"Lucy Is Enceinte\" first aired on December 8, 1952 (\"enceinte\" being French for \"expecting\" or \"pregnant\"). One week later, on December 15, 1952, the episode titled \"Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable\" was aired (although the show never displayed episode titles on the air). The episode in which Lucy gives birth, \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital\", first aired on January 19, 1953, which was the day before the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower as President of the United States. To increase the publicity of this episode, the original air date was chosen to coincide with Lucille Ball's real-life delivery of Desi Jr. by Caesarean section. \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital\" was watched by more people than any other television program up to that time, with 71.7% of all American television sets tuned in, topping the 67.7 rating for the inauguration coverage the following morning.\n\nUnlike some programs that advance the age of a newborn over a short period, \"I Love Lucy\" at first allowed the Little Ricky character to grow up in real time. America saw Little Ricky as an infant in the 1952–53 season and a toddler from 1953 to 1956. However, for the 1956–57 season, Little Ricky suddenly aged by two years, becoming a young school-age boy from 1956 to 1960. Five actors played the role, two sets of twins and later Keith Thibodeaux, whose stage name when playing Ricky Ricardo Jr. was Richard Keith. (In the Superman episode, Little Ricky is mentioned as being five years old but it had been less than four years since the birth-of-Little-Ricky episode.)\n\nJess Oppenheimer stated in his memoir, \"Laughs, Luck...and Lucy: How I Came to Create the Most Popular Sitcom of All Time\", that the initial plan was to match the sex of the Ricardo baby with Lucille Ball's real baby, inserting one of two alternate endings into the broadcast print at the very last minute. When logistical difficulties convinced Oppenheimer to abandon this plan, he advised Desi that as head writer, he would have Lucy Ricardo give birth to a boy. Desi agreed, telling Oppenheimer that Lucy had already given him one girl, and might give him another—this might be his only chance to get a son. When the baby boy was born, Desi immediately called Oppenheimer and told him, \"Lucy followed your script. Ain't she something?\", to which Oppenheimer replied \"Terrific! That makes me the greatest writer in the world!\"\n\nThe opening familiar to most viewers, featuring the credits superimposed over a \"heart on satin\" image, was created specifically for the 1959–67 CBS daytime network rebroadcasts, and subsequent syndication. As originally broadcast, the episodes opened with animated matchstick figures of Arnaz and Ball making reference to whoever the particular episode's sponsor was. These sequences were created by the animation team of William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, who declined screen credit because they were technically under exclusive contract to MGM at the time.\n\nThe original sponsor was cigarette maker Philip Morris, so the program opened with a cartoon of Lucy and Ricky climbing down a pack of Philip Morris cigarettes. In the early episodes, Lucy and Ricky, as well as Ethel and Fred on occasion, were shown smoking Philip Morris cigarettes. Lucy even went so far as to parody Johnny Roventini's image as the Philip Morris \"bellhop\" in the May 5, 1952, episode, \"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\". Since the original sponsor references were no longer appropriate when the shows went into syndication, a new opening was needed, which resulted in the classic \"heart on satin\" opening. Other sponsors, whose products appeared during the original openings, were Procter & Gamble for Cheer and Lilt Home Permanent (1954–57), General Foods for Sanka (1955–57), and Ford Motor Company (1956–57). The later \"Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show\" was sponsored by Ford Motor Company (1957–58) and Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1958–60), as part of the \"Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse\".\n\nThe original openings, with the sponsor names edited out, were revived on TV Land showings, with a TV Land logo superimposed to obscure the original sponsor's logo. However, this has led some people to believe that the restored introduction was created specifically for TV Land as an example of kitsch.\n\nThe animated openings, along with the middle commercial introductory animations, are included, fully restored, in the DVDs. However, the openings are listed as special features within the disks with the \"heart on satin\" image opening the actual episodes.\n\nThe complete original broadcast versions of Seasons 1 and 2, as seen in 1951–1953 with intros, closings, and all commercials, are included on their respective Ultimate Season Blu-ray editions.\n\nThe title music from the second season on was written by Eliot Daniel as an instrumental. Lyrics were written by Harold Adamson, who was nominated five times for an Oscar. The lyrics to \"I Love Lucy\" were sung by Desi Arnaz in the episode \"Lucy's Last Birthday\":\n\n\"I love Lucy and she loves me.\n\"We're as happy as two can be.\n\"Sometimes we quarrel but then\n\"How we love making up again.\n\n\"Lucy kisses like no one can.\n\"She's my missus and I'm her man,\n\"And life is heaven you see,\n\" 'Cause I love Lucy, Yes I love Lucy, and Lucy loves me!\"\n\"I Love Lucy\" sung by Desi Arnaz with Paul Weston and the Norman Luboff Choir was released as the B-side of \"There's A Brand New Baby (At Our House)\" by Columbia Records (catalog number 39937) in 1953. The song was covered by Michael Franks on the album \"Dragonfly Summer\" (1993). In 1977, the Wilton Place Street Band had a Top 40 hit with a disco version of the theme, \"Disco Lucy\".\n\n\"I Love Lucy\" aired Mondays from 9:00 to 9:30 PM ET on CBS for its entire first run. Each year during its summer hiatus its timeslot was occupied by various summer replacement series. Beginning in April 1955 CBS added reruns from the show's early years to its early evening weekend schedule. This would be the first of several occasions when \"I Love Lucy\" reruns would become part of CBS's evening, prime time, and (later on) daytime schedules.\n\nIn fall 1967, CBS began offering the series in off-network syndication; , the reruns air on the Hallmark Channel and MeTV networks, and scores of television stations in the U.S. and around the world, including Fox's KTTV/KCOP in Los Angeles until December 31, 2018.\n\nIn addition, CBS has run numerous specials, including a succession of annual specials which feature episodes which have been newly colorized.\n\nThe episode \"Lucy Goes to the Hospital\", which first aired on Monday, January 19, 1953, garnered a record 71.7 rating, meaning 71.7% of all households with television sets at the time were tuned in to view the program. That record is surpassed only by Elvis Presley's first of three appearances on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", which aired on September 9, 1956 (82.6% rating). The overall rating of 67.3 for the entire 1952 season of \"I Love Lucy\" continues to be the highest average rating for any single season of a TV show.\n\n\nThere was some thought about creating an \"I Love Lucy\" radio show to run in conjunction with the television series as was being done at the time with the CBS hit show \"Our Miss Brooks\". On February 27, 1952, a sample \"I Love Lucy\" radio show was produced, but it never aired. This was a pilot episode, created by editing the soundtrack of the television episode \"Breaking the Lease\", with added Arnaz narration (in character as Ricky Ricardo). It included commercials for Philip Morris, which sponsored the television series. While it never aired on radio at the time in the 1950s (Philip Morris eventually sponsored a radio edition of \"My Little Margie\" instead), copies of this radio pilot episode have been circulating among \"old time radio\" collectors for years, and this radio pilot episode has aired in more recent decades on numerous local radio stations that air some \"old time radio\" programming.\n\nBall and Arnaz authorized various types of \"I Love Lucy\" merchandise. Beginning in November 1952, \"I Love Lucy\" dolls, manufactured by the American Character Doll Company, were sold. Adult-size \"I Love Lucy\" pajamas and a bedroom set were also produced; all of these items appeared on the show.\n\nDell Comics published 35 issues of an \"I Love Lucy\" comic book between 1954 and 1962 including two try-out Four Color issues (#535 and #559). King Features syndicated a comic strip (written by Lawrence Nadel and drawn by Bob Oksner, jointly credited as \"Bob Lawrence\") from 1952 to 1955. Eternity Comics in the early 1990s issued comic books that reprinted the strip and Dell comic book series.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the sixth season of \"I Love Lucy\", the Arnazes decided to cut down on the number of episodes that were filmed. Instead, they extended \"I Love Lucy\" to 60 minutes, with a guest star each episode. They renamed the show \"The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show\", also known as \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\". Thirteen hour-long episodes aired from 1957 to 1960. The main cast, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley and Little Ricky/Richard Keith (birth name Keith Thibodeaux) were all in the show. \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\" is available on DVD, released as \"I Love Lucy: The Final Seasons 7, 8, & 9\". On March 2, Desi's birthday, 1960, the day after the last hour-long episode was filmed, Lucille Ball filed for divorce from Desi Arnaz. It made that playful, yet passionate kiss at the end of the final episode, which aired April 1, \"Lucy Meets the Moustache\", all the more poignant, as the world already knew that this storied Hollywood marriage was all but over, and also lent extra meaning to the use of the song \"That's All\" (performed by guest star Edie Adams) in that episode.\n\nAs already mentioned, Vance and Frawley were offered a chance to take their characters to their own spin-off series. Frawley was willing, but Vance refused to ever work with Frawley again since the two did not get along. Frawley did appear once more with Lucille Ball — in an episode of \"The Lucy Show\" in 1965, which did not include Vance (who by then had ceased to be a regular on that show). However, this was his last screen appearance with his longtime friend. He died in Hollywood on March 3, 1966, of a heart attack at age 79.\n\nIn 1962, Ball began a six-year run with \"The Lucy Show\", followed immediately in 1968 by six more years on a third sitcom, \"Here's Lucy\", finally ending her regular appearances on CBS in 1974. Both \"The Lucy Show\" and \"Here's Lucy\" included Vance as recurring characters named \"Viv\" (Vivian Bagley Bunson on \"The Lucy Show\" and Vivian Jones on \"Here's Lucy\"), so named because she was tired of being recognized on the street and addressed as \"Ethel\". Vance was a regular during the first three seasons of \"The Lucy Show\" but continued to make guest appearances through the years on \"The Lucy Show\", and on \"Here's Lucy\". In 1977, Vance and Ball were reunited one last time in the CBS special, \"Lucy Calls the President\", which co-starred Gale Gordon (whom Ball had known for very many years by 1977 and who had appeared as a regular on her television shows since 1963; becoming even more prominent once Vivian Vance left \"The Lucy Show\" in 1965.)\n\nIn 1986, Ball tried another sitcom, \"Life with Lucy\". The series debuted on ABC to solid ratings, landing in Nielsen's Top 25 for the week. Its ratings quickly declined, however, and resulted in a cancellation after eight episodes.\n\nIn 1989, the never-seen pilot episode was discovered and revealed in a CBS television special, hosted by Lucie Arnaz, becoming the highest rated program of the season.\n\nIn 2012, Emily VanDerWerff of \"The A.V. Club\" wrote retrospectively:\"I Love Lucy\" […] is one of the two foundational texts of American TV comedy, along with \"The Honeymooners\". The series is legitimately the most influential in TV history, pioneering so many innovations and normalizing so many others that it would be easy to write an appreciation of simply, say, the show’s accidental invention of the TV rerun.\n\n\"I Love Lucy\" continues to be held in high esteem by television critics, and remains perennially popular. For instance, it was one of the first American programs seen on British television — which became more open to commerce with the September 1955 launch of ITV, a commercial network that aired the series; in 1982, the launch of a second terrestrial TV station devoted to advertising funded broadcasting (Channel 4) saw the show introduced to a new generation of fans in the UK, with the \"Channel 4\" network repeating the program several times between 1983 and 1994. As of January 2015, meanwhile, it remains the longest-running program to air continuously in the Los Angeles area, almost 60 years after production ended. However, the series is currently aired on KTTV on weekends and now KCOP on weekdays because both stations are a duopoly. Ironically, KTTV was the original CBS affiliated station in Los Angeles until 1951, just before \"I Love Lucy\" premiered on KNXT Channel 2 (now KCBS-TV) when CBS bought that station the same year. In the US, reruns have aired nationally on TBS (1980s–1990s), Nick at Nite (1994–2001) and TV Land (2001–2008) in addition to local channels. TV Land ended its run of the series by giving viewers the opportunity to vote on the show's top 25 greatest episodes on December 31, 2008 through the network's website. This is particularly notable because, unlike some shows to which a cable channel is given exclusive rights to maximize ratings, \"Lucy\" has been consistently — and successfully — broadcast on multiple channels simultaneously. Hallmark Channel is now the home for \"I Love Lucy\" in the United States, with the show having moved to the network on January 2, 2009, while the national version of Weigel Broadcasting's MeTV digital subchannel network has carried the program since its debut in December 15, 2010, depending on the market (in markets where another station holds the rights, \"The Lucy Show\" is substituted). The show is seen on Fox Classics in Australia.\n\nIn addition to Primetime Emmy Awards and nominations, \"I Love Lucy's\" many honors include the following:\n\n\nOn February 10, 1991, CBS aired a television movie titled \"Lucy & Desi: Before the Laughter\", about the lives of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The movie recreated a number of scenes from classic \"I Love Lucy\" episodes, including \"Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying to Murder Her\" and \"Lucy Does a TV Commercial.\" Frances Fisher starred as Lucy and Maurice Benard as Desi.\n\nOn May 4, 2003, CBS aired a television movie titled \"Lucy\", portraying the life of Lucille Ball and recreating a number of scenes from classic \"I Love Lucy\" episodes, including \"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\", \"Lucy Is Enceinte\", and \"Job Switching\". Near the end of the movie, a selection of \"TV Guide\" covers is seen in a hallway, showing \"I Love Lucy\" franchises on their covers. Also included is close-up of a \"New York Post\" article about the birth of Little Ricky. Rachel York starred as Lucy and Danny Pino as Desi.\n\nIn October of 2011, the stage play \"I Love Lucy Live on Stage\" premiered to sold-out houses at the Greenway Court Theatre in Los Angeles. Staged and directed by Rick Sparks, the show featured the performance of two \"I Love Lucy\" episodes – “The Benefit” and “Lucy Has Her Eyes Examined”, presented to the theatre audience as though they were attending a filming at the Desilu Playhouse in the 1950s. In 2012, the show began a national tour which lasted until 2015. \n\nIn July of 2018, \"I Love Lucy: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Sitcom,\" a behind-the-scenes comedy about \"I Love Lucy\" by Gregg Oppenheimer (son of series creator Jess Oppenheimer), had its world premiere in a Los Angeles production by L.A. Theatre Works. Recorded before a live audience at the James Bridges Theater, UCLA, the production aired on public radio and was released on Audio CD and as a downloadable mp3 in September of that year. The performance starred Sarah Drew as Lucy, Oscar Nuñez as Desi, and Seamus Dever as Jess Oppenheimer.\n\nIn the spring of 2020 NBC's sitcom \"Will & Grace\" will pay tribute to \"I Love Lucy\" with a special episode titled \"We Love Lucy\". During the episode Lucy, Ricky Ricardo, Ethel Mertz, and Fred appear in dream sequences based on scenes from the 1951 CBS series. Lucie Arnaz, daughter of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz will be making a cameo in the episode. \n\nSeveral classic episodes of \"I Love Lucy\" have been colorized. Star and producer Desi Arnaz had expressed interest in airing the show in color as early as 1955, but the cost of such a presentation was prohibitive at the time.\n\nThe first episode to be colorized was the Christmas special, which had been feared to be lost for many years, as it was not included in the regular syndication package with the rest of the series. A copy was discovered in 1989 in the CBS vaults and was aired by CBS during December of that year in its original black-and-white format. In 1990, this episode was again aired in the days prior to Christmas, but this time the framing sequence was in color, while the clips from earlier episodes remained in black and white. The special performed surprisingly well in the ratings during both years, and aired on CBS each December through 1994.\n\nIn 2007, as the \"Complete Series\" DVD set was being prepared for release, DVD producer Gregg Oppenheimer decided to have the episode \"Lucy Goes to Scotland\" digitally colorized (referencing color publicity stills and color \"home movies\" taken on the set during production), making it the first \"I Love Lucy\" episode to be fully colorized. Four years later, Time Life released the \"Lucy's Italian Movie\" episode for the first time in full color as part of the \"Essential 'I Love Lucy'\" collection.\n\nThe colorized \"Lucy Goes to Scotland\" episode has never aired on television, but that episode, along with the Christmas special and \"Lucy's Italian Movie\", were packaged together on the 2013 \"I Love Lucy Colorized Christmas\" DVD. In 2014, Target stores sold an exclusive version of the DVD that also included \"Job Switching\".\n\nOn December 20, 2013, CBS revived an annual holiday tradition when it reaired the Christmas special for the first time in nearly two decades. The Christmas special's framing sequence was colorized anew. The network paired this special with the color version of \"Lucy's Italian Movie\" episode. This special attracted 8.7 million people. Nearly a year later, on December 7, 2014, the Christmas special was again aired on CBS, but this time paired with the popular episode \"Job Switching\", which was newly colorized for that broadcast. That episode appeared on the \"I Love Lucy: The Ultimate Season 2\" Blu-ray edition released on August 4, 2015. CBS aired the Christmas special again on December 23, 2015, with the flashback scenes being colorized for the first time, and with a colorized \"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\" replacing \"Job Switching\". CBS next aired the Christmas special on December 2, 2016, this time paired with the newly colorized \"Lucy Gets in Pictures\". On December 22, 2017, the Christmas episode was followed by a newly colorized episode, \"The Fashion Show\". On December 14, 2018, the Christmas episode was paired with a newly colorized episode, \"Pioneer Women\".\n\nOn May 17, 2015, CBS began a new springtime tradition when it aired two newly colorized episodes in an \"I Love Lucy Superstar Special\" consisting of \"L.A. at Last\" and \"Lucy and Superman\", which attracted 6.4 million viewers. A DVD of this special was released on October 4, 2016. A second \"Superstar Special\" containing the newly colorized two-part episode \"Lucy Visits Grauman's\" and \"Lucy and John Wayne\" aired on May 20, 2016 and was released on DVD on January 17, 2017. A third \"Superstar Special\" aired on May 19, 2017, featuring two more newly colorized Hollywood-based episodes: \"The Dancing Star\" featuring Van Johnson, and \"Harpo Marx\". A two-episode \"Funny Money Special\" was introduced on April 19, 2019, featuring the episodes \"The Million-Dollar Idea\" and \"Bonus Bucks\", both from early 1954. On December 20, 2019, CBS aired its annual \"I Love Lucy\" Christmas episode along with a new colorized episode, \"Paris At Last\". \"The I Love Lucy Christmas Special\" scored a 4.9 million in the ratings, becoming the night's most-watched show on television.\n\nOn August 6, 2019, Ball's would-be 108th birthday, a one-night-only event took place in movie theaters around the United States, \"I Love Lucy: A Colorized Celebration\", a feature film consisting of five colorized episodes, three of which contain never-before-seen content. The episodes included are: \"The Million Dollar Idea\" (1954), \"Lucy Does a TV Commercial\" (1952), \"Pioneer Women\" (1952), \"Job Switching\" (1952) and \"L.A. at Last!\" (1955). A short documentary on the colorization process of the episodes was also included. The film proved to be very successful, grossing $777,645 from 660 theaters across the country, coming in at #6 at the domestic box office and beating Disney's \"Aladdin\".\n\nBeginning in the summer of 2001, Columbia House Television began releasing \"I Love Lucy\" on DVD in chronological order. They began that summer with the pilot and the first three episodes on a single DVD. Every six weeks, another volume of four episodes would be released on DVD in chronological order. During the summer of 2002, each DVD would contain between five and seven episodes on a single DVD. They continued to release the series very slowly and would not even begin to release any season 2 episodes until the middle of 2002. By the spring of 2003, the third season on DVD began to be released with about six episodes released every six weeks to mail order subscribers. All these DVDs have the identical features as the DVDs eventually released in the season box sets in retail.\n\nBy the fall of 2003, season four episodes began to be offered by mail. By the spring of 2004 season five DVDs with about six episodes each began to be released gradually. Columbia House ended the distribution of these mail order DVDs in the Winter of 2005. They began releasing complete season sets in the Summer of 2004 every few months. They stated that Columbia House Subscribers would get these episodes through mail before releasing any box sets with the same episodes. They finally ended gradual subscriptions in 2005, several months before season 5 became available in retail. Columbia House then began to make season box sets available instead of these single volumes.\n\nCBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released all six seasons of \"I Love Lucy\" on DVD in Region 1, as well as all 13 episodes of \"The Lucy and Desi Comedy Hour\" (as \"I Love Lucy: The Final Seasons – 7, 8, & 9\"). Bonus features include rare on-set color footage and the \"Desilu/Westinghouse\" promotional film, as well as deleted scenes, original openings and interstitials (before they were altered or replaced for syndication) and on-air flubs. These DVDs offered identical features and identical content to the mail order single sets formerly available until 2005.\nIn December 2013, the first high-definition release of \"I Love Lucy\" was announced, with the Blu-ray edition of the first season, scheduled for May 5, 2014. The Second Season Ultimate Blu-ray was released on August 4, 2015.\n\n\nThe DVD releases feature the syndicated heart opening, and offer the original broadcast openings as bonus features. Season 6 allows viewers to choose whether to watch the episodes with the original opening or the syndicated opening. The TV Land openings are not on these DVDs.\n\nInitially, the first season was offered in volumes, with four episodes per disc. After the success of releasing seasons 2, 3, and 4 in slimpacks, the first season was re-released as a seven disc set, requiring new discs to be mastered and printed to include more episodes per disc so there would be fewer discs in the set. For the complete series box set, the first season would be redone again, this time to six DVDs, retaining all bonus features. The individual volume discs for the first season are still in print, but are rare for lack of shelf space and because the slimpacks are more popular. In 2012, all season sets were reissued in slipcovered clear standard-sized amaray DVD cases, with season 1 being the 6-disc version as opposed to the 7-disc version.\n\nEpisodes feature English closed-captioning, but only Spanish subtitles.\n\nIn Australia and the UK, the first three seasons were finally released in Region 2 & Region 4 on August 3, 2010, by CBS, distributed by Paramount. Season 1 includes the pilot and all 35 Season 1 episodes in a 7-disc set. Season 2 includes all 31 Season 2 episodes in a 5-disc set. Season 3 includes all 31 Season 3 episodes in a 5-disc set. Season 2 and 3 are in a slimline pack. All three seasons have been restored and digitally remastered. All episodes appear in order of their original air dates, although it states that some episodes may be edited from their original network versions. It is unknown if the remaining seasons will be released individually. A complete series box set titled \"I Love Lucy: Complete Collection\" was scheduled for release on April 6, 2016, and in the UK on May 30, 2016. This collection contains 34 DVDs with all six seasons of \"I Love Lucy\" and all 13 episodes of \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\".\n\nIn September 2018, Time-Life released a DVD, \"Lucy: The Ultimate Collection\", which collected 76 episodes of \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour\", \"The Lucy Show\", \"Here's Lucy\", and the short-lived ABC-TV series \"Life with Lucy\" (which has never before been released to home media), plus a wide variety of bonus features.\n\nA DVD collection, \"I Love Lucy: Colorized Collection\" was released on August 13, 2019. It contains every colorized episode of \"I Love Lucy\" aired to date of the set's release date.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "166713", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=166713", "title": "Meet the Press", "text": "Meet the Press\n\nMeet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program broadcast on the network NBC. It is the longest-running program in television history, though the current format bears little resemblance to the debut episode on November 6, 1947. \"Meet the Press\" specializes in interviews with leaders in Washington, D.C., across the country and even the world on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's bureau in Washington, D.C. (WRC-TV).\n\nThe longevity of \"Meet the Press\" is attributable in part to the fact that the program debuted during what was only the second official \"network television season\" for American television. It was the first live television network news program on which a sitting President of the United States appeared, this occurred on the November 9, 1975 broadcast, which featured Gerald Ford.\n\nThe program has been hosted by 12 different moderators to date, beginning with creator Martha Rountree. The show's moderator since 2014 is Chuck Todd, who also serves as political director for NBC News.\n\nCurrently, the hour-long program airs in most markets on Sundays at 9:00 a.m. live in the Eastern Time Zone and on tape delay elsewhere. \"Meet the Press\" is also occasionally pre-empted due to network coverage of sports events held outside the U.S. The program is also rebroadcast on Sundays at 2:00 p.m., and Mondays at 2:00 a.m., and sometimes 4:00 a.m. Eastern Time on MSNBC, whose audio feed is also simulcast on Sirius/XM Satellite Radio. The program is also syndicated by Westwood One to various radio stations around the United States, as well as on C-SPAN Radio as part of its replays of the Sunday morning talk shows.\n\nThe program's format consists of an extended one-on-one interview with the host, and is sometimes followed by a roundtable discussion or one-on-two interview with figures in adversarial positions, either Congressional members from opposite sides of the aisle or political commentators. Originally a half-hour program for most of its history, the show expanded to 60 minutes starting with the September 20, 1992, broadcast.\n\nThe program also features in-depth examinations of facts behind political and general news stories (particularly as part of a segment called the \"Data Download\", introduced after Chuck Todd assumed duties as moderator, which is conducted on a touchscreen within the main set).\n\n\"Meet the Press\" began on radio on the Mutual Broadcasting System in 1945 as \"American Mercury Presents: Meet the Press\", a program to promote \"The American Mercury\", a magazine that Lawrence E. Spivak purchased in 1935. Before the program aired, Spivak asked journalist Martha Rountree, who had worked in radio and had been employed by Spivak as a roving editor for the magazine, to critique the plans for the new radio show. Based on her advice, Rountree created a new radio program that she called \"The American Mercury\", on October 5, 1945.\n\nOn November 6, 1947, while still on the Mutual Broadcasting System, the television rights to the program were purchased by General Foods, which began to air the show on the NBC television network with the title shortened to simply \"Meet the Press\"; the radio version also adopted the new name. Although some sources credit Spivak with the program's creation, Rountree developed the idea on her own, and Spivak joined as co-producer and business partner in the enterprise after the show had already debuted.\n\"Meet the Press\" was originally presented as a 30-minute press conference with a single guest and a panel of questioners. Its first guest was James Farley, who served as Postmaster General, Democratic National Committee chairman and campaign manager to Franklin Delano Roosevelt under the first two terms of the New Deal Administration. Creator Rountree served as its first host, the program's only female moderator to date. She stepped down on November 1, 1953, and was succeeded by Ned Brooks, who remained as moderator until his retirement on December 26, 1965. Spivak became the moderator on January 1, 1966, moving up from his role as a permanent panelist. He retired on November 9, 1975, on a special one-hour edition that featured, for the first time, a sitting president, Gerald Ford, as guest. The next week, Bill Monroe, previously a weekly panelist like Spivak had been years before, took over as moderator and stayed until June 2, 1984.\n\nFor the next seven and a half years, the program then went through a series of hosts as it struggled in the ratings against ABC's \"This Week with David Brinkley\". Roger Mudd and Marvin Kalb, as co-moderators, followed Monroe for a year, followed by Chris Wallace (who would later to go on to a much longer run as host of the rival program \"Fox News Sunday\") from 1987 to 1988. Garrick Utley, then hosting \"Weekend Today\", concurrently hosted \"Meet the Press\" from 1989 through December 1, 1991. All this occurred despite the increasing ratings of NBC News' other programs (and those of the network generally) during that period. The program originally aired at noon Eastern Time every Sunday, before moving to a 9:00 a.m. slot by the early 1990s.\n\nNetwork officials, concerned for the show's future, turned to Tim Russert, the network's Washington, D.C., bureau chief. He took over as moderator of \"Meet the Press\" on December 8, 1991, and remained with the program until his death on June 13, 2008, becoming the longest serving moderator in the program's history.\n\nUnder Russert, the program was expanded to one hour and became less of a televised press conference, focusing more on Russert's questions and comments; Russert also engaged in longer in-depth interviews and hosted panels of experts to discuss the topics featured in that week's broadcast. Russert signed off each edition by saying, \"That's all for today. We'll be back next week. If it's Sunday, it's \"Meet the Press\".\"\n\nDuring the professional football season, Russert, a native of Buffalo, New York, and an avid fan of the Buffalo Bills, sometimes added, \"Go Bills!,\" and occasionally would ask panelists, \"How 'bout those Sabres?\" if Buffalo's NHL hockey team was doing well. Spoofs of the show featured in a recurring sketch on \"Saturday Night Live\" often reflected his impromptu additions in support of the two professional sports franchises. By 2006, \"Meet the Press\" was the highest-rated program among the Sunday morning talk shows.\n\nRussert died on June 13, 2008, of a sudden coronary thrombosis (caused by a cholesterol plaque rupture). Former \"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Tom Brokaw hosted a special edition of \"Meet the Press\" dedicated to the life of Russert on June 15, 2008, in which Russert's chair was left empty as a tribute.\n\n\nMark Whitaker was named by NBC News as the division's Washington D.C. Bureau Chief and was given \"executive oversight\" of \"Meet the Press\".\n\n\"NBC Nightly News\" anchor Brian Williams acted as moderator of the first show following the June 15, 2008 tribute to Russert, with the same guests and subject matter that Russert was planning for when he died.\n\nFollowing Russert's death, Tom Brokaw was named the interim moderator through the 2008 general elections. Brokaw followed Russert's tradition by signing off with \"We'll be back next Sunday because if it's Sunday, it's \"Meet the Press\"\" (a sign-off that would continue to be used by his successors as moderator). In September of that year, the show was presented with limited commercial interruption.\n\nOn August 10, 2008, David Gregory moderated the panel discussion during the second half-hour of the broadcast, while Brokaw anchored the first half-hour from the site of the Summer Olympics in Beijing. The following week on August 17, 2008 he moderated the entire broadcast. It was also reported on December 1, 2008, that the December 7, 2008 broadcast would be Brokaw's last, with Gregory becoming the new permanent host the following Sunday.\n\nDavid Gregory began his tenure as moderator on December 14, 2008. Four days after Gregory's first regular broadcast, on December 18, 2008, NBC News political director Chuck Todd was named contributing editor of \"Meet the Press\". Throughout Gregory's tenure as moderator, \"Meet the Press\" experienced significant ratings declines. In the final three months of 2013, the program placed third among the Sunday morning talk shows in total viewership, behind CBS's \"Face the Nation\" and ABC's \"This Week\" for the first time since 1992, it also experienced the lowest ratings in the show's entire history among the key 25-to-54 age viewing demographic during this period. NBC management became uncertain as to the future direction of the program.\n\nA new set was introduced on May 2, 2010, featuring video screens and library-style bookshelves; Gregory would preview the guests to be featured during each week's broadcast using a large video screen. Different, modified intro music was also introduced, with the \"Meet the Press\" theme music in a shorter \"modernized [style]... the beginning repeated with drum beats\" (see \"High-definition broadcasting\" below for additional information).\n\nIn response to declining viewership, rumors surfaced in August 2014 that Gregory would be replaced as the program's moderator. NBC News President Deborah Turness apparently had held discussions with Jon Stewart (then-host of Comedy Central's news comedy program \"The Daily Show\") to replace Gregory, which Stewart later confirmed in a \"Rolling Stone\" interview, saying, \"My guess is they were casting as wide and as weird a net as they could. I'm sure part of them was thinking, 'Why don't we just make it a variety show?\n\nOn August 14, 2014, Turness announced that Chuck Todd, NBC's chief White House correspondent, would take over the role of moderator on September 7, 2014. Because of Todd's Dodger fanhood, a Los Angeles Dodger poster became part of the physical format.\n\nOn September 28, 2015, MSNBC premiered MTP Daily, a new weekday spin-off also hosted by Todd. It formally replaced \"The Ed Show\" as MSNBC's early-evening program after a transitional period following its cancellation. MSNBC explained that the program is meant to \"bring the insight and power of \"Meet the Press\" to our air every day of the week\".\n\nIn a December 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, Todd discussed how disinformation overtook the media during the Trump administration, however, PressThink, a project of the Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute at New York University, took Todd to task for failing to address the issue as it unfolded, in a very detailed discussion of Todd's remarks.\n\nThe set utilized from March 17, 1996 to April 25, 2010, had been designed as an experimental set for high-definition broadcasting; several editions of the program (including the first broadcast of a regular series on a major television network in HD) had aired in the format in the 1990s over experimental HD station WHD-TV in Washington, D.C. Despite this, the program continued to be transmitted in 480i standard definition over the NBC network itself. On May 2, 2010, \"Meet the Press\" became the last NBC News program to convert to high definition, and unveiled a new set consisting of large video screens mostly used to display Washington scenery, satellite interview subjects and moderator and subject talking points, along with graphics produced for the format.\n\nThe following is the list of moderators for \"Meet the Press\":\nThe following is a partial list of notable guests and milestones for the show.\n\nIn addition to its broadcasts on NBC, \"Meet the Press\" also airs on various other NBCUniversal-owned channels domestically and internationally, including MSNBC, CNBC in the United States and Canada, CNBC Europe in Europe and CNBC Asia in Asia. It is also broadcast in Australia on the Seven Network and in the Philippines on 9TV.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" is also available as an audio or video podcast, and is simulcast on radio stations by Westwood One (which also handles distribution of all other NBC-produced radio programming, including NBC News Radio).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "23372115", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=23372115", "title": "Monty Python's Flying Circus", "text": "Monty Python's Flying Circus\n\nMonty Python’s Flying Circus is a British surreal sketch comedy series created by and starring the comedy group Monty Python, consisting of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam, aka the \"Pythons\". The first episode was recorded at the BBC on 7 September and premiered on 5 October 1969 on BBC1, with 45 episodes airing over four series from 1969 to 1974, plus two episodes for German TV.\n\nThe series stands out for its use of absurd situations, mixed with risqué and innuendo-laden humour, sight gags and observational sketches without punchlines. Live action segments were broken up with animations by Gilliam, often merging with the live action to form segues. The overall format used for the series followed and elaborated upon the style used by Spike Milligan in his ground breaking series \"Q5\", rather than the traditional sketch show format. The Pythons play the majority of the series characters themselves, along with supporting cast members including Carol Cleveland (referred to by the team as the unofficial \"Seventh Python\"), Connie Booth (Cleese's first wife), series producer Ian MacNaughton, Ian Davidson, musician Neil Innes, and Fred Tomlinson and the Fred Tomlinson Singers for musical numbers. \n\nThe programme came about as the six Pythons, having met each other through university and in various radio and television programmes in the 1960s, sought to make a new sketch comedy show unlike anything else on British television at the time. Much of the humour in the series's various episodes and sketches targets the idiosyncrasies of British life, especially that of professionals, as well as aspects of politics. Their comedy is often pointedly intellectual, with numerous erudite references to philosophers and literary figures and their works. The team intended their humour to be impossible to categorise, and succeeded (although, by their perspective, failed) so completely that the adjective \"Pythonesque\" was invented to define it and, later, similar material. However, their humour was not always seen as appropriate for television by the BBC, leading to some censorship during the third series. Cleese left the show following that series, and the remaining Pythons completed a final shortened fourth season before ending the show.\n\nThe show became very popular in the United Kingdom, and after initially failing to draw an audience in the United States, gained American popularity after Public Broadcasting Service affiliates began airing the show in 1974. The success on both sides of the Atlantic led to the Pythons going on live tours and creating three additional films, while the individual Pythons flourished in solo careers. \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" has become an influential work on comedy as well the ongoing popular culture.\n\n\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" is a sketch comedy show, though does not adhere to any regular format. The sketches include live-action skits performed by Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gilliam, along with animations created by Gilliam, frequently used as linking devices or interstitial between skits. The show's introductory theme, which varied with each series, was also based on Gilliam's animations, its theme music set to \"The Liberty Bell\" march by John Philip Sousa, and ending with a shot of the show's title before being crushed by a giant foot. Gilliam selected the rendition of the march performed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, published in 1893, as under the Berne Convention and United States copyright law, the work had fallen into the public domain, allowing them to avoid royalty payments.\n\nThe title \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" was partly the result of the group's reputation at the BBC. Michael Mills, the BBC's Head of Comedy, wanted their name to include the word \"circus\" because the BBC referred to the six members wandering around the building as a circus, in particular, \"Baron Von Took's Circus\", after Barry Took, who had brought them to the BBC. The group added \"flying\" to make it sound less like an actual circus and more like something from World War I. The group was coming up with their name at a time when the 1966 Royal Guardsmen song \"Snoopy vs. the Red Baron\" had been at a peak. \"Freiherr\" Manfred von Richthofen, the World War I German flying ace known as The Red Baron, commanded the Jagdgeschwader 1 squadron of planes known as \"The Flying Circus.\" \n\nThe words \"Monty Python\" were added because they claimed it sounded like a really bad theatrical agent, the sort of person who would have brought them together, with John Cleese suggesting \"Python\" as something slimy and slithery, and Eric Idle suggesting \"Monty\". They later explained that the name Monty \"...made us laugh because Monty to us means Lord Montgomery, our great general of the Second World War\".\n\nThe BBC had rejected some other names put forward by the group including \"Whither Canada?\", \"The Nose Show\", \"Ow! It's Colin Plint!\", \"A Horse, a Spoon and a Basin\", \"The Toad Elevating Moment\" and \"Owl Stretching Time\". Several of these titles were later used for individual episodes.\n\nCompared with many other sketch comedy shows, \"Flying Circus\" had fewer recurring characters, many of whom were involved only in titles and linking sequences. Continuity for many of these recurring characters was frequently non-existent from sketch to sketch, with sometimes even the most basic information (such as a character's name) being changed from one appearance to the next.\n\nThe most frequently returning characters on the show include:\n\n\nOther characters appearing multiple times include:\n\nOther returning characters include a married couple, often mentioned but never seen, Ann Haydon-Jones and her husband Pip. In \"Election Night Special\", Pip has lost a political seat to Engelbert Humperdinck. Several recurring characters are played by different Pythons. Both Palin and Chapman played the insanely violent Police Constable Pan Am. Both Jones and Palin portrayed police sergeant Harry 'Snapper' Organs of Q division. Various historical figures were played by a different cast member in each appearance, such as Mozart (Cleese, then Palin), or Queen Victoria (Jones, then Palin, then all five Pythons in Series 4).\n\nSome of the Pythons' real-life targets recurred more frequently than others. Reginald Maudling, a contemporary Conservative politician, was singled out for perhaps the most consistent ridicule. Then-Secretary of State for Education and Science, and (well after the programme had ended) Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was occasionally mentioned, in particular referring to Thatcher's brain as being in her shin received a hearty laugh from the studio audience. Then-US President Richard Nixon was also frequently mocked, as was Conservative party leader Edward Heath, prime minister for much of the series' run. The British police were also a favourite target, often acting bizarrely, stupidly, or abusing their authority, frequently in drag.\n\nThere were a total of 45 episodes of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" made across four series.\n\nTwo episodes were produced in German for WDR (Westdeutscher Rundfunk), both titled \"Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus\", the literal German translation of the English title. While visiting the UK in the early 1970s, German entertainer and TV producer Alfred Biolek caught notice of the Pythons. Excited by their innovative, absurd sketches, he invited them to Germany in 1971 and 1972 to write and act in two special German episodes.\n\nThe first episode, advertised as \"Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus: Blödeln für Deutschland\" (\"Monty Python's Flying Circus: Clowning around for Germany\"), was produced in 1971 and performed in German. The second episode, advertised as \"Monty Python’s Fliegender Zirkus: Blödeln auf die feine englische Art\" (\"Monty Python's Flying Circus: Clowning around in the distinguished English way\"), produced in 1972, was recorded in English and dubbed into German for its broadcast in Germany. The original English recording was transmitted by the BBC in October 1973.\n\nPrior to the show, the six main cast members had met each other as part of various comedy shows: Jones and Palin were members of The Oxford Revue, while Chapman, Cleese, and Idle were members of Cambridge University's Footlights, and while on tour in the United States, met Gilliam. In various capacities, the six worked on a number of different British radio and television comedy shows from 1964 to 1969 as both writers and on-screen roles. The six began to collaborate on ideas together, blending elements of their previous shows, to devise the premise of a new comedy show which presented a number of skits with minimal common elements, as if it were comedy presented by a stream of consciousness. This was aided through the use of Gilliam's animations to help transition skits from one to the next.\n\nAlthough there were few recurring characters, and the six cast members played many diverse roles, each perfected some character traits.\n\nGraham Chapman often portrayed straight-faced men, of any age or class, frequently authority figures such as military officers, policemen or doctors. His characters could, at any moment, engage in \"Pythonesque\" maniacal behaviour and then return to their former sobriety. He was also skilled in abuse, which he brusquely delivered in such sketches as \"The Argument Clinic\" and \"Flying Lessons\". He adopted a dignified demeanour as the leading \"straight man\" in the Python feature films \"Holy Grail\" (King Arthur) and \"Life of Brian\" (title character Brian).\n\nJohn Cleese played ridiculous authority figures. Gilliam claims that Cleese is the funniest of the Pythons in drag, as he barely needs to be dressed up to look hilarious, with his square chin and 6' 5\" (196 cm) frame (see the \"Mr. and Mrs. Git\" sketch). Cleese also played intimidating maniacs, such as an instructor in the \"Self Defence Against Fresh Fruit\" sketch. His character Mr. Praline, the put-upon consumer, featured in some of the most popular sketches, most famously in \"Dead Parrot\". One star turn that proved most memorable among Python fans was \"The Ministry of Silly Walks\", where he worked for the eponymous government department. The sketch displays the notably tall and loose-limbed Cleese's physicality in a variety of silly walks. Despite its popularity, particularly among American fans, Cleese himself particularly disliked the sketch, feeling that many of the laughs it generated were cheap and that no balance was provided by what could have been the true satirical centrepoint. Another of his trademarks is his over-the-top delivery of abuse, particularly his screaming \"You bastard!\"\n\nCleese often played foreigners with ridiculous accents, especially Frenchmen, most of the time with Palin. Sometimes this extended to the use of actual French or German (such as \"The Funniest Joke in the World\", \"Hitler in Minehead\", or \"La Marche Futile\" at the end of \"The Ministry of Silly Walks\"), but still with a very heavy accent (or impossible to understand, as for example Hitler's speech).\n\nMany Python sketches were linked together by the cut-out animations of Terry Gilliam, including the opening titles featuring the iconic giant foot that became a symbol of all that was 'Pythonesque'. Gilliam’s unique visual style was characterised by sudden, dramatic movements and deliberate mismatches of scale, set in surrealist landscapes populated by engravings of large buildings with elaborate architecture, grotesque Victorian gadgets, machinery, and people cut from old Sears Roebuck catalogues. Gilliam added airbrush illustrations and many famous pieces of art. All of these elements were combined in incongruous ways to obtain new and humorous meanings in the tradition of surrealist \"collage assemblies\".\n\nThe surreal nature of the series allowed Gilliam’s animation to go off on bizarre, imaginative tangents. Some running gags derived from these animations were a giant hedgehog named Spiny Norman who appeared over the tops of buildings shouting, \"Dinsdale!\", further petrifying the paranoid Dinsdale Piranha; and The Foot of Cupid, the giant foot that suddenly squashed things. The latter is appropriated from the figure of Cupid in the Agnolo Bronzino painting \"Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time\".\n\nNotable Gilliam sequences for the show include Conrad Poohs and his Dancing Teeth, the rampage of the cancerous black spot, The Killer Cars and a giant cat that stomps its way through London, destroying everything in its path.\n\nInitially only hired to be the animator of the series, Gilliam was not thought of (even by himself) as an on-screen performer at first, being American and not very good at the deep and sometimes exaggerated English accent of his fellows. The others felt they owed him something and so he sometimes appeared before the camera, usually in the parts that no one else wanted to play, generally because they required a lot of make-up or involved uncomfortable costumes. The most recurrent of these was The-Knight-Who-Hits-People-With-A-Chicken, a knight in armour who would walk on-set and hit another character on the head with a plucked chicken when they said something really corny. Some of Gilliam's other on-screen portrayals included:\n\nGilliam soon became distinguished as the go-to member for the most obscenely grotesque characters. This carried over into the \"Holy Grail\" film, where Gilliam played King Arthur's hunchbacked page 'Patsy' and the bridgekeeper at the Bridge of Death. It has also been claimed that he was originally asked by Terry Jones to play Mr. Creosote in \"The Meaning of Life\", but turned it down.\n\nEric Idle is known for his roles as a cheeky, suggestive playboy (\"Nudge Nudge\"), a variety of pretentious television presenters (such as his over-the-top portrayal of Philip Jenkinson in the segments connecting the \"Cheese Shop\" and \"Salad Days\" sketches), a crafty, slick salesman (\"Door-to-Door Joke Salesman\", \"Encyclopedia Salesman\") and the merchant who loves to haggle in \"Monty Python’s Life of Brian\". He is acknowledged as 'the master of the one-liner' by the other Pythons. He is also considered the best singer/songwriter in the group; for example, he wrote and performed \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" from \"The Life of Brian\". Unlike Jones, he often played female characters in a more straightforward way, only altering his voice slightly, as opposed to the falsetto shrieking used by the others. Several times, Idle appeared as upper-class, middle-aged women, such as Rita Fairbanks (\"Reenactment of the Battle of Pearl Harbor\") and the sexually-repressed Protestant wife in the \"Every Sperm is Sacred\" sketch, in \"The Meaning of Life\".\n\nBecause he was not from an already-established writing partnership prior to Python, Idle wrote his sketches alone.\n\nAlthough all of the Pythons played women, Terry Jones is renowned by the rest to be 'the best Rat-Bag woman in the business'. His portrayal of a middle-aged housewife was louder, shriller, and more dishevelled than that of any of the other Pythons. Examples of this are the \"Dead Bishop\" sketch, his role as Brian's mother Mandy in \"Life of Brian\", Mrs Linda S-C-U-M in \"Mr Neutron\" and the café proprietor in \"Spam\". Also recurring was the upper-class reserved men, in \"Nudge, Nudge\" and the \"It's a Man's Life\" sketch, and incompetent authority figures (Harry \"Snapper\" Organs). He also played the iconic Nude Organist that introduced all of series three. Generally, he deferred to the others as a performer, but proved himself behind the scenes, where he would eventually end up pulling most of the strings. Jones also portrayed the tobacconist in the \"Hungarian translation sketch\" and the enormously fat and bucket vomiting Mr. Creosote in Meaning of Life.\n\nMichael Palin was regarded by the other members of the troupe as the one with the widest range, equally adept as a straight man or wildly over the top character. He portrayed many working-class northerners, often portrayed in a disgusting light: \"The Funniest Joke in the World\" sketch and the \"Every Sperm Is Sacred\" segment of \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\". In contrast, Palin also played weak-willed, put-upon men such as the husband in the \"Marriage Guidance Counsellor\" sketch, or the boring accountant in the \"Vocational Guidance Counsellor\" sketch. He was equally at home as the indefatigable Cardinal Ximinez of Spain in \"The Spanish Inquisition\" sketch. Another high-energy character that Palin portrays is the slick TV show host, constantly smacking his lips together and generally being over-enthusiastic (\"Blackmail\" sketch). In one sketch, he plays the role with an underlying hint of self-revulsion, where he wipes his oily palms on his jacket, makes a disgusted face, then continues. One of his most famous creations was the shopkeeper who attempts to sell useless goods by very weak attempts at being sly and crafty, which are invariably spotted by the customer (often played by Cleese), as in the \"Dead Parrot\" and \"Cheese Shop\" sketches. Palin is also well known for his leading role in \"The Lumberjack Song\".\n\nPalin also often plays heavy-accented foreigners, mostly French (\"La marche futile\") or German (\"Hitler in Minehead\"), usually alongside Cleese. In one of the last episodes, he delivers a full speech, first in English, then in French, then in heavily accented German.\n\nOf all the Pythons, Palin played the fewest female roles. Among his portrayals of women are Queen Victoria in the \"Michael Ellis\" episode, Debbie Katzenberg the American in \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\", a rural idiot's wife in the \"Idiot in rural society\" sketch, and an implausible English housewife who is married to Jean-Paul Sartre.\n\nThe production team was headed by Ian MacNaughton. Other regular team members included Hazel Pethig (costumes), Madelaine Gaffney (makeup) and John Horton (video effects designer). Maggie Weston, who worked on both makeup and design, married Gilliam in 1973 and they are still together. The series was primarily filmed in London studios and nearby locations, although location shooting to take in beaches and villages included filming in Somerset and Norwich.\n\nPre-production of the series had started by April 1969. Documents from the BBC showed that the viability of the show had been threatened around this time when Cleese reminded the BBC that he was still under contract from David Frost's David Paradine Productions, who wanted to co-produce the show. The BBC memos indicated the potential of holding off the show until 1971, when Cleese's contract with Paradine expired, but ultimately the situation was resolved, though the details of these negotiations have been lost.\n\nThe first episode aired on the BBC on Sunday, 5 October 1969, at 10:50 p.m. The BBC had to assure some of its workers from striking who thought the show was replacing a late-night religious devotional show by asserting it was using the alternative programming to give clergymen time off on their busiest day. The first episode did not fare well in terms of audience, capturing only about 3% of the total UK population, roughly 1.5 million, compared to \"Dad's Army\" that had 22% on the Thursday of that same week. In addition to the lowest audience figures for shows during that week, the first episode has had the lowest Appreciation Index for any of the BBC's light entertainment programmes. While public reception improved over the course of the first series, BBC executives had already had acquired a bad taste for the show, with some BBC documents describing the show as \"disgusting and nihilistic\". Some within the BBC had been more upbeat on how the first series worked out and congratulated the group by the end of the first series, but the larger dislike for the show had already made an impact on the troupe, as Cleese expressed that he would not likely continue to participate after making the second series. Separately, the BBC had to re-edit several of the first series' episodes to remove the personal address and phone number for David Frost that the troupe had included in some sketches.\n\nThe second series, while more popular than the first, further stressed the relations between the troupe and the BBC. Two of the sketches from the series finale \"Royal Episode 13\" were called out by BBC executives in a December 1970 meeting: \"The Queen Will be Watching\" which the troupe mocks the UK national anthem, and the \"Undertakers sketch\" which took a comedic turn on how to dispose of the body of a loved one. The BBC executives criticised producer MacNaughton for not alerting them to the content prior to airing. According to Palin via his published diary, the BBC started to censor the program within the third series following this.\n\nCleese remained for the third season but left afterwards. Cleese cited that he was no longer interested in the show, believing most of the material was rehashes of prior skits. He also found it more difficult to work with Chapman who was struggling with alcoholism at the time. The remaining Pythons continued to produce a shortened fourth series with only six episodes before deciding to end the show, with the final episode broadcast on 5 December 1974.\n\nThe first cut that the BBC forced on the show was the removal of David Frost's phone number from re-airings of episode 102 in the sketch \"The Mouse Problem\". The Pythons had slipped in a real contact number for David Frost to the initial airing, which resulted in numerous viewers bothering him.\n\nSome material originally recorded went missing later, such as the use of the word \"masturbating\" in the \"Summarize Proust\" sketch (which was muted during the first airing, and later cut out entirely) or \"What a silly bunt\" in the Travel Agent sketch (which featured a character [Idle] who has a speech impediment that makes him pronounce \"C\"s as \"B\"s), which was cut before the sketch ever went to air. However, when this sketch was included in the album \"Monty Python's Previous Record\" and the \"Live at the Hollywood Bowl\" film, the line remained intact. Both sketches were included in the Danish DR K re-airing of all episodes (\"Episode 31\", aired 1 November 2018, 6:50 pm).\n\nSome sketches were deleted in their entirety and later recovered. One such sketch is the \"Party Political Broadcast (Choreographed)\", where a Conservative Party spokesman (Cleese) delivers a party political broadcast before getting up and dancing, being coached by a choreographer (Idle), and being joined by a chorus of spokesmen dancing behind him. The camera passes two Labour Party spokesmen practising ballet, and an animation featuring Edward Heath in a tutu. Once deemed lost, a home-recorded tape of this sketch, captured from a broadcast from Buffalo, New York PBS outlet WNED-TV, turned up on YouTube in 2008. Another high-quality recording of this sketch, broadcast on WTTW in Chicago, has also turned up on YouTube. The Buffalo version can be seen as an extra on the new Region 2/4 eight-disc \"The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus\" DVD set. The Region 1 DVD of \"Before The Flying Circus\", which is included in \"The Complete Monty Python's Flying Circus Collector's Edition Megaset\" and \"Monty Python: The Other British Invasion\", also contains the Buffalo version as an extra.\n\nAnother lost sketch is the \"Satan\" animation following the \"Crackpot Religion\" piece and the \"Cartoon Religion Ltd\" animation, and preceding the \"How Not To Be Seen\" sketch: this had been edited out of the official tape. Six frames of the animation can be seen at the end of the episode, wherein that particular episode is repeated in fast-forward. A black and white 16 mm film print has since turned up (found by a private film collector in the US) showing the animation in its entirety.\n\nAt least two references to cancer were censored, both during the second series. In the sixth episode (\"It's A Living\" or \"School Prizes\"), Carol Cleveland's narration of a Gilliam cartoon suddenly has a male voice dub 'gangrene' over the word cancer (although this word was used unedited when the animation appeared in the movie \"And Now for Something Completely Different\", the 2006 special \"Terry Gilliam's Personal Best\" used this audio to restore the censored line). Another reference was removed from the sketch \"Conquistador Coffee Campaign\", in the eleventh episode \"How Not to Be Seen\", although a reference to leprosy remained intact. This line has also been recovered from the same 16 mm film print as the above-mentioned \"Satan\" animation.\n\nA sketch from Episode 7 of Series 2 (subtitled 'The Attila the Hun Show') featured a parody of Michael Miles, the 1960s TV game show host (played by Cleese), and was introduced as 'Spot The Braincell'. This sketch was deleted shortly afterwards from a repeat broadcast as a mark of respect following Miles' death in February 1971. Also, the controversial \"Undertaker\" sketch from Episode 13 of the same series was removed by the BBC after negative reviewer response. Both of these sketches have been restored to the official tapes, although the only source for the Undertaker sketch was an NTSC copy of the episode, duplicated before the cut had been made.\n\nAnimation in episode 9 of series 3 was cut out following the initial broadcast. The animation was a parody of a German commercial, and the original owners complained about the music use, so the BBC simply removed part of the animation, and replaced the music with a song from a Python album. Terry Gilliam later complained about the cut, thinking it was because producer Ian McNaughton \"just didn't get what it was and he cut it. That was a big mistake.\"\n\nMusic copyright issues have resulted in at least two cuts. In episode 209, Graham Chapman as a Pepperpot sings \"The Girl from Ipanema\", but some versions use \"Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair\", which is public domain. In the bus conductor sketch in episode 312, a brief parody of \"Tonight\" from \"West Side Story\" has been removed from recent releases. There have also been reports of substituting different performances of classical music in some uses, presumably because of performance royalties.\n\nA Region 2 DVD release of Series 1–4 was released by Sony in 2007. This included certain things which had been cut from the US A&E releases, including the \"masturbation\" line, but failed to reinstate most of the long-lost sketches and edits. A Blu-ray release of the series featuring every episode restored to its original uncut broadcast length was released by Network for the show's 50th anniversary in 2019.\n\nAt the time of the original broadcasting of \"Monty Python\" in the United Kingdom, the BBC used Time-Life Television to distribute its shows in the United States. For \"Monty Python\", Time-Life had been concerned that the show was \"too British\" in its humour to reach American audiences, and did not opt to bring the programme across. Additionally, the Python's first film, \"And Now for Something Completely Different\", a selection of skits from the show released in the UK in 1971 and in the United States in 1972, did not fare well with American audiences. During their first North American tour in 1973, the Pythons performed twice on US television, firstly on \"The Tonight Show\", hosted by Joey Bishop, and then on \"The Midnight Special\". The group spoke of how badly the first appearance went down with the audience; Idle described \"The Tonight Show\" performance: \"We did thirty minutes [of material] in fifteen minutes to no laughs whatsoever. We ran out onto the green grass in Burbank and we lay down and laughed for 15 minutes because it was the funniest thing ever. In America they didn’t know what on earth we were talking about.\" \n\nDespite the poor reception on their live appearances on American television, the Pythons' American manager, Nancy Lewis, began to push the show herself into the States. In 1974, the PBS station KERA in Dallas was the first television station in the United States to broadcast episodes of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", and is often credited with introducing the programme to American audiences. Many other PBS stations acquired the show, and by 1975, was often the most popular show on these stations. \"And Now for Something Completely Different\" was re-released to American theaters in 1974 and had a much better box office take that time. That would also set the stage for the Pythons' next film, \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", released near simultaneously in the UK and the United States in April 1975, to also perform well in American theaters. The popularity of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" helped to open the door for other British television series to make their way into the United States via PBS.\n\nWith the rise in American popularity, the ABC network acquired rights to show select episodes of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" in their \"Wide World of Entertainment\" showcase in mid 1975. However, ABC re-edited the episodes, thus losing the continuity and flow intended in the originals. When ABC refused to stop treating the series in this way, the Pythons took them to court. Initially the court ruled that their artistic rights had indeed been violated, but it refused to stop the ABC broadcasts. However, on appeal the team gained control over all subsequent US broadcasts of its programmes. The case also led to their gaining the rights from the BBC, once their original contracts ended at the end of 1980.\n\nThe show also aired on MTV in 1988, during the network's infancy; \"Monty Python\" was part of a two-hour comedy block on Sunday nights that also included another BBC series, Pebble Mill At One.\n\nIn April 2006, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" returned to non-cable American television on PBS. In connection with this, PBS commissioned \"Monty Python's Personal Best\", a six-episode series featuring each Python’s favourite sketches, plus a tribute to Chapman, who died in 1989. BBC America has aired the series on a sporadic basis since the mid-2000s, in an extended 40-minute time slot in order to include commercials. IFC acquired the rights to the show in 2009, though not exclusive, as BBC America still airs occasional episodes of the show. IFC also presented a six-part documentary \"\", produced by Terry Jones' son Bill.\n\nThe members of Monty Python embarked on a series of stage shows during and after the television series. These mostly consisted of sketches from the series, though they also revived material which predated it. One such sketch was the Four Yorkshiremen sketch, written by Cleese and Chapman with Marty Feldman and Tim Brooke-Taylor, and originally performed for \"At Last the 1948 Show\"; the sketch subsequently became part of the live Python repertoire. The shows also included songs from collaborator Neil Innes.\n\nRecordings of four of these stage shows have subsequently appeared as separate works:\n\nGraham Chapman and Michael Palin also performed on stage at the Knebworth Festival in 1975 with Pink Floyd.\n\nIn 2005, a troupe of actors headed by Rémy Renoux, translated and \"adapted\" a stage version of \"Monty Python’s Flying Circus\" into French. Usually the original actors defend their material very closely, but given in this case the \"adaptation\" and also the translation into French (with subtitles), the group supported this production. The adapted material sticks close to the original text, mainly deviating when it comes to ending a sketch, something the Python members themselves changed many times over the course of their stage performances.\nLanguage differences also occur in the lyrics of several songs. For example, \"Sit on My Face\" (which translated into French would be \"Asseyez-vous sur mon visage\") becomes \"cum in my mouth\".\n\n\"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" placed fifth on a list of the BFI TV 100, drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000, and voted for by industry professionals.\n\n\"Time\" magazine included the show on its 2007 list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\".\n\nIn a list of the 50 Greatest British Sketches released by Channel 4 in 2005, five Monty Python sketches made the list:\n\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" was ranked #5 and #6 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever.\n\nIn 2013, the programme was ranked #58 on TV Guide's list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.\n\nDouglas Adams, creator of \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" and co-writer of the \"Patient Abuse\" sketch, once said \"I loved Monty Python's Flying Circus. For years I wanted to be John Cleese, I was most disappointed when I found out the job had been taken.\"\n\nLorne Michaels counts the show as a major influence on his \"Saturday Night Live\" sketches. Cleese and Palin re-enacted the Dead Parrot sketch on \"SNL\" in 1997.\n\nThe show was a major influence on the Danish cult sketch show \"Casper & Mandrilaftalen\" (1999) and Cleese starred in its 50th episode.\n\nIn computing, the terms spam and the Python programming language, are both derived from the series.\n\nAs of 2013, questions concerning the Pythons' most famous sketches are incorporated in the examinations required of those seeking to become British citizens.\n\nThe overall humour of \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" is built on an inherent Britishness; it is “based on observations of British life, society, and institutions”. However, part of this focus is achieved through seeing the ‘other’ through a British lens. The often “excessive generalization and utterly banal stereotypes” can be seen as a persiflage of the views held by the British public, rather than poking fun at the cultures that were depicted.\n\nFor example, while American culture is not often in the foreground in many sketches, it is rather a frequent side note in many skits. Almost all of the 45 episodes produced for the BBC contain a reference to Americans or American culture, with 230 references total, resulting in approximately five references per show, but increasing over the course of the show. In total, 140 references to the American entertainment industry are made. Entertainment tropes, such as Westerns, Film noir and Hollywood are referenced 39 times. Further, there are 12 references to arts and literature, 15 to US politics, 5 to the American military, 7 to US historical events, 12 to locations in the US, 7 to space and science fiction, 21 economic references, such as brands like Pan-Am, Time-Life, and Spam, and 8 sports references. Some references do double count in various categories. It is also notable that American music is regularly heard in the show, such as the theme to the television series \"Dr. Kildare\", but most prominently the show's theme tune (\"The Liberty Bell\" by John Philip Sousa).\n\nWhile American entertainment was a pervasive cultural influence in Britain at the time of the production of the series, not all references to American culture can be seen as conscious decisions. For example, Terry Jones did not know that Spam was an American product at the time he wrote the sketch. Kevin Kern summarises in his analysis of references to the US 'that portrayals of American themes reflected three broad responses to American hegemony: 1) minor or passing references to specific individuals, events, or products of American culture, 2) American cultural tropes used to serve a general comedic purpose, and 3) satire aimed at American targets, specifically US economic power, the crassness or banality of American culture, or American violence and militarism'. However, Kern does not see this as exhibiting anti-American tendencies, but as 'a natural extension of the Pythons’ frequent (…) satirical focus on vulgarity, banality, violence, and militarism in the United Kingdom (…)' \n\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography \n"}

The series first aired on ABC in January 1977. \"Roots\" received 37 Primetime Emmy Award nominations and won nine. It also won a Golden Globe and a Peabody Award. It received unprecedented Nielsen ratings for the finale, which still holds a record as the third-highest-rated episode for any type of television series, and the second-most watched overall series finale in U.S. television history. It was produced on a budget of $6.6 million. The series introduced LeVar Burton in the role of Kunta Kinte.\n\nA sequel, \"\", first aired in 1979, and a second sequel, \"\", a Christmas TV movie, starring Burton and Louis Gossett Jr., first aired in 1988. A related film, \"Alex Haley's Queen\", is based on the life of Queen Jackson Haley, who was Alex Haley's paternal grandmother.\n\nIn 2016, a remake of the original miniseries, with the same name, was commissioned by the History channel and screened by the channel on Memorial Day.\n\nIn The Gambia, West Africa, in 1750, Kunta Kinte is born to Omoro Kinte (Thalmus Rasulala), a Mandinka warrior, and his wife, Binta (Cicely Tyson). He was raised in a Muslim family. When Kunta (LeVar Burton) reaches the age of 15, he and a group of other adolescent boys take part in tribal manhood training, ending with a ceremony, after which they become recognized as men and Mandinka warriors. While trying to carry out a task to catch a bird and take it home unharmed, Kunta sees white men carrying firearms, along with their black collaborators. Later, while fetching wood outside his village to make a drum for his younger brother, Kunta is captured by black collaborators under the direction of white men. He is then sold to a slave trader and placed aboard a ship under the command of Capt. Thomas Davies (Edward Asner) for a three-month journey to Colonial America. During the voyage, a group of rebels among the human cargo try but fail to stage a mutiny and to take over the ship.\n\nThe ship eventually arrives in Annapolis, Maryland, in 1767, where the captured Africans are sold at auction as slaves. John Reynolds (Lorne Greene), a plantation owner from Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg, buys Kunta and gives him the name Toby. Reynolds assigns an older slave, Fiddler (Louis Gossett Jr.), to teach Kunta to speak English and to train him in the ways of living and working as a chattel slave. Kunta, in a persistent struggle to become free again, makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape. Further, to preserve his Mandinka heritage and maintain his Mandinka roots, he wants not to change his name, and he resists such a change. An overseer, Ames (Vic Morrow), gathers the slaves and directs one of them to whip Kunta after his latest attempt to escape and to continue whipping him until he finally acknowledges his new name. For events that occur in 1775, between the above period and the post–Revolutionary War, where the next section begins, see \"\".\n\nIn 1776 the adult Kunta Kinte (John Amos) experiences serving as a chattel slave and feels haunted by his Mandinka roots and his memories of freedom at home in Africa. John Reynolds, his owner, does not receive as much cash as he has expected from the sale of his crop of tobacco, so, to settle a debt to his brother, Dr. William Reynolds (Robert Reed), the local physician, John transfers several of his slaves, including Kunta Kinte and Fiddler, to William. Kunta tries again to escape, but a pair of slave-catchers seize him, bind him, and chop off about half his right foot (to limit his ability to run away again). Kunta meets Bell (Madge Sinclair), the cook for William's family. Bell successfully treats both Kunta's mangled foot and his wounded spirit. By 1780 he eventually submits to the harsh life, and he marries Bell in a ceremony, which includes jumping across a broom. Bell bears a daughter, to whom Kunta gives the name Kizzy, which means \"stay put\" in the Mandinka language. Fiddler continues to mentor and befriend Kunta, and Fiddler eventually dies at an old age in 1790.\n\nAn adulterous relationship between Dr. William Reynolds and John Reynolds's wife (Lynda Day George) produces a daughter, Missy Anne (Tracey Gold), whom John apparently believes to be his own offspring. Later, Anne (Sandy Duncan) and Kizzy (Leslie Uggams), about two years younger than Anne, become playmates and best friends within the social limits of the plantation culture. Anne secretly teaches Kizzy to read and write, and both Anne and Bell, Kizzy's mother, strictly and severely caution Kizzy to avoid allowing anyone else to learn about her clandestine and forbidden education. In 1806 Kizzy, in her teen years, falls in love with Noah (Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs), another slave at William's plantation, but Noah runs away and is caught and returned. During a beating Noah reveals that Kizzy has forged for him a traveling pass by copying a similar pass which Anne has given to Kizzy. William has previously assured his slaves that he would keep them all together at his plantation, not selling away any of them against their will as long as they \"follow the rules\". However, William regards the pass and the escape to be such serious breaches of trust that he separately sells both Noah and Kizzy. Much weeping and wailing attend the departure of Kizzy, who desperately reaches out to Anne for help, only to be coldly shunned by her for helping Noah in his escape. William sells Kizzy to Tom Moore (Chuck Connors), a planter in Caswell County, North Carolina, who promptly rapes her, impregnating her with a son, to whom he gives the name George.\n\nIn 1824 Sam Bennett (Richard Roundtree), a fancy carriage driver and a suitor who seeks to impress, takes Kizzy for a short visit to the plantation of Dr. William Reynolds, in the hope that she can see her parents. Kizzy learns that Bell has been sold away and that Kunta died two years earlier. Kizzy sees her father's grave and his wooden marker; using a small stone, she scratches over the name Toby and writes below it \"Kunta Kinte,\" and promises him that his descendants will be free one day. George (Ben Vereen), under the tutelage of Mingo (Scatman Crothers), an older slave, learns much about cockfighting, and, by direction of Tom Moore, their master, George takes over as the chief trainer, the \"cock of the walk\". George befriends Marcellus, a free black man, and fellow cockfighter, who informs him about the possibility of buying his own freedom. In 1831, a now-adult George continues to believe Moore to be a friend until he realizes his master's true feeling when he and his family are threatened at gunpoint by Moore and his wife, as a result of the Nat Turner rebellion. Although none of Moore's slaves are personally involved in the rebellion, they become victims of the paranoid suspicions of their master, so they start planning to buy their freedom. In an emotional scene, Kizzy reveals to George the identity of his father.\n\nGeorge becomes an expert in cockfighting, thus earning for himself the moniker \"Chicken George\". Squire James (Macdonald Carey), Moore's main adversary in the pit, arranges for a British owner, Sir Eric Russell (Ian McShane), and twenty of his cocks to visit and to participate in the local fights. Moore eventually bets a huge sum on his best bird, which George has trained, but he loses, and he cannot pay. Under the terms of a settlement between Moore and Russell, George goes to England to train cocks for Russell and to train more trainers and is forced to leave behind Kizzy (his mother), Tildy (Matilda, his wife) (Olivia Cole), and his sons, Tom and Lewis (Georg Stanford Brown and Hilly Hicks). Moore promises to set George free after George returns. In one brief scene Kizzy and Anne Reynolds, both elderly, face each other one last time, and Missy Anne denies that she \"recollects\" a \"darkie by the name of Kizzy\". Kizzy then spits into Anne's cup of water without Anne's realizing.\n\nGeorge returns 14 years later, in 1861, shortly before the start of the Civil War. He proudly announces that Moore, after some reluctance on Moore's part and some persuasion on George's part, has kept his word by granting George his freedom. He learns that Kizzy has died two months before, that Tom and Lewis now belong to Sam Harvey (Richard McKenzie), that Tom (Georg Stanford Brown) has become a blacksmith on the Harvey plantation, and that Tom has a wife, Irene (Lynne Moody), and two sons. He also learns that his relatives have spoken well of him during his absence. He further learns that according to a law in North Carolina, if he stays 60 days in that state as a freed slave, he will lose his freedom, so he heads northward, seeking the next stage in his career as a cockfighter and awaiting the end of the war, the emancipation of the slaves, and another reunion of his family.\n\nWhile the war continues to its inevitable end, a hungry and destitute young white couple from South Carolina, George and Martha Johnson (Brad Davis and Lane Binkley), arrive and ask for help, and the slave family take them in. Martha soon gives birth, but the child is stillborn. The white couple stays on with Tom and his wife, and becomes a part of their community. Tom Harvey meets harassment at the hands of two brothers, Evan and Jemmy Brent (Lloyd Bridges and Doug McClure). Eventually, a month before the surrender by the South, Jemmy deserts the Confederate Army during the final desperate days of the war, and he shows up at Tom's blacksmith shop. Tom reluctantly runs an errand for him but, on returning, he finds Jemmy trying to rape Irene, and in the resulting fight Tom drowns him in the quenching tub. Later Evan, now an officer in the Confederate cavalry, arrives at the shop, demands to know about Jemmy, gets no answer, and angrily tells Tom that he has not yet finished with him.\n\nAfter the war several local white men, led by Evan Brent and wearing white hoods (made from fabric sacks from Evan's store) begin to harass and terrorize Tom, his family, and other members of his community. Tom emerges as the leader among his group. As the local blacksmith, Tom devises a horseshoeing method to identify the horses involved in the raids by the hooded men. But when Tom reports his suspicions and his evidence to the sheriff (John Quade), in sympathy with Evan and knowing every member of the white mob, tips off Evan. Evan's mob leads another raid against Tom, during which Tom is whipped savagely. George Johnson, in his capacity as the overseer of the plantation, intervenes and is forced to whip Tom, to his own horror and disgust, in order to save his friend's life.\n\nMeanwhile, the former owner of the farm, Sam Harvey, is forced to surrender all of his property to Senator Arthur Justin (Burl Ives), a local politician intent on acquiring as much land as possible. Under the terms of the surrender, his former slaves are allowed to stay on as sharecroppers, with eventual rights to own a part of the land. However, because no written deed has been filed, the senator deems the agreement void and imposes heavy debts on the black farmers.\n\nThe night of the whipping of Tom, George unexpectedly returns, raises the spirits of his relatives and friends, and begins to plot their next step. He reports that he has bought some land in Tennessee. Using some cunning and deception of their own, the group makes preparations for their move away. After one final confrontation with Evan and his gang, George and his company start their trek from North Carolina to Tennessee. In the last scene George and his group arrive on his land in Henning, Lauderdale County, Tennessee, to start their new life. George retells part of the story from Kunta Kinte in Africa to himself in Tennessee. Then Alex Haley briefly narrates a montage of photographs of family members connecting Tom's daughter, Cynthia, a great-great-granddaughter of Kunta Kinte, to Haley himself. For the continuation of the story from the late 19th century into the 20th century, see \".\"\n\nNumber in parentheses indicates how many episodes in which the actor/character appears.\n\n\nThe miniseries was directed by Marvin J. Chomsky, John Erman, David Greene, and Gilbert Moses. It was produced by Stan Margulies. David L. Wolper was executive producer. The score was composed by Gerald Fried, and Quincy Jones for only the first episode. ABC television executives \"got cold feet\" after seeing the brutality depicted in the series and attempted to cut the network's predicted losses by airing the series over eight consecutive nights in January in one fell swoop. The Museum of Broadcast Communications recounts the apprehensions that \"Roots\" would flop, and how this made ABC prepare the format:\n\nMany familiar white TV actors, like Chuck Connors (from \"The Rifleman\"), Lorne Greene (\"Bonanza\" and later \"Battlestar Galactica\"), Robert Reed (\"The Brady Bunch\"), and Ralph Waite (\"The Waltons\"), were cast against type as slave holders and traders.\n\nThe film score was composed, arranged and conducted by Quincy Jones, and the soundtrack album was released on the A&M label in 1977.\n\nAllmusic's Richard S. Ginell said \"Quincy Jones has been threatening to write a long tone poem sketching the history of black music for decades now, and he has yet to do it. This project, rushed out in the wake of the 1977 TV mini-series \"Roots\", is about as close as he has come. A brief (28 minutes) immaculately-produced and segued suite, Roots quickly traces a timeline from Africa to the Civil War, incorporating ancient and modern African influences (with Letta Mbulu as the featured vocalist), a sea shanty, field hollers, and fiddle tunes, snippets of dialogue from Roots actor Lou Gossett, and some Hollywood-style movie cues. ... Though some prominent jazzers turn up in the orchestra, there is not a trace of jazz to be heard. This is a timely souvenir of a cultural phenomenon, but merely a curiosity for jazz fans\".\n\nAll compositions by Quincy Jones except where noted\n\n\nFollowing the success of the original novel and the miniseries, Haley was sued by author Harold Courlander, who asserted that \"Roots\" was plagiarized from his own novel \"The African\", published nine years prior to \"Roots\" in 1967. The resulting trial ended with an out-of-court settlement and an admission from Haley that certain passages within \"Roots\" had been copied from Courlander's work. Separately, researchers refuted Haley's claims that, as the basis for \"Roots\", Haley had traced his own ancestry back through slavery to a very specific individual and village in Africa. After a five-week trial in federal district court, Courlander and Haley settled the case with a financial settlement and a statement that \"Alex Haley acknowledges and regrets that various materials from \"The African\" by Harold Courlander found their way into his book, \"Roots\".\" During the trial, presiding U.S. District Court Judge Robert J. Ward stated, \"Copying there is, period.\" In a later interview with BBC Television, Judge Ward stated, \"Alex Haley perpetrated a hoax on the public.\" During the trial, Alex Haley had maintained that he had not read \"The African\" before writing \"Roots\". Shortly after the trial, however, a minority studies teacher at Skidmore College, Joseph Bruchac, came forward and swore in an affidavit that he had discussed \"The African\" with Haley in 1970 or 1971 and had given his own personal copy of \"The African\" to Haley, events that took place well before publication of \"Roots\".\n\n\"Roots\" originally aired on ABC for eight consecutive nights from January 23 to 30, 1977. In the United Kingdom, BBC One aired the series in six parts, starting with parts 1 to 3 over the weekend of April 8 to 11, 1977. The concluding three parts were broadcast on Sunday nights, from April 15 to May 1. The six-part version screened by the BBC is the version released on home video.\n\nThe miniseries was watched by an estimated 130 million and 140 million viewers total (more than half of the U.S. 1977 population of 221 million—the largest viewership ever attracted by any type of television series in US history as tallied by Nielsen Media Research) and averaged a 44.9 rating and 66% to 80% viewer share of the audience. The final episode was watched by 100 million viewers and an average of 80 million viewers watched each of the last seven episodes. Eighty-five percent of all television homes saw all or part of the miniseries. All episodes rank within the List of most watched television broadcasts|top 100 rated TV shows of all time.\n\nOn February 16–18, 2013, in honor of Black History Month and the 36th anniversary of \"Roots\", cable network BET aired both \"Roots\" and its sequel miniseries, \"\". Celebrating the 35th anniversary of \"Roots\", BET premiered the miniseries on a three-day-weekend showing in December 2012, which resulted in its being seen by a total of 10.8 million viewers, according to Nielsen ratings, and became the number-one \"Roots\" telecast in cable-television history. As for the BET network, its 35th-anniversary airing of \"Roots\" became its best \"non-tentpole\" weekend in the network's history. On Sunday, October 18, 2015, TVOne rebroadcast \"Roots\" in high definition.\n\nWarner Home Video, which released a three-disc 25th-anniversary DVD edition of the series in 2002, released a four-disc (three double-sided, one single-sided) 30th-anniversary set on May 22, 2007.

{"id": "48064", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48064", "title": "Sesame Street", "text": "Sesame Street\n\nSesame Street is an American educational children's television series that combines live action, sketch comedy, animation and puppetry. It is produced by Sesame Workshop (known as the Children's Television Workshop (CTW) until June 2000) and was created by Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett. The program is known for its images communicated through the use of Jim Henson's Muppets, and includes short films, with humor and cultural references. The series premiered on November 10, 1969, to positive reviews, some controversy, and high viewership; it has aired on the U.S.'s national public television provider PBS since its debut, with its first run moving to premium channel HBO on January 16, 2016.\n\nThe format of \"Sesame Street\" consists of a combination of commercial television production elements and techniques which have evolved to reflect the changes in American culture and the audience's viewing habits. With the creation of \"Sesame Street\", producers and writers of a children's television show used, for the first time, educational goals and a curriculum to shape its content. It was also the first time a show's educational effects were formally studied. The show, therefore, has undergone significant changes in its history as adjustments to the format and content have been made to reflect change sources to the curriculum.\n\nShortly after creating \"Sesame Street\", its producers developed what came to be called the \"CTW model\" (after the production company's previous name), a system of television show planning, production, and evaluation based on collaborations between producers, writers, educators, and researchers. The show was initially funded by government and private foundations but has become somewhat self-supporting due to revenues from licensing arrangements, international sales, and other media. By 2006, there were independently produced versions, or \"co-productions\", of \"Sesame Street\" broadcast in twenty countries. In 2001, there were over 120 million viewers of various international versions of \"Sesame Street\", and by the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was broadcast in more than 140 countries.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" was by then the fifteenth-highest-rated children's television show in the United States. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2018, it was estimated that 86 million Americans had watched the series as children. As of 2018, \"Sesame Street\" has won 189 Emmy Awards and 11 Grammy Awards, more than any other children's show.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Foundation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children's television show that would \"master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them\", such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children's Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of US$8 million ($ million in dollars) from the Carnegie Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children's television show. The program premiered on public television stations on November 10, 1969. It was the first preschool educational television program to base its contents and production values on laboratory and formative research. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy, and high ratings. By its 50th anniversary in 2019, there were over 150 versions of \"Sesame Street\", produced in 70 languages. As of 2006, 20 international versions had been produced.\n\nAccording to writer Michael Davis, by the mid-1970s \"Sesame Street\" the show had become \"an American institution\". The cast and crew expanded during this time, with emphasis on the hiring of women crew members and the addition of minorities to the cast. The show's success continued into the 1980s. In 1981, when the federal government withdrew its funding, CTW turned to, and expanded, other revenue sources, including its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign broadcast income. \"Sesame Street\"s curriculum has expanded to include more affective topics such as relationships, ethics, and emotions. Many of the show's storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew, most notably, the 1982 death of Will Lee—who played Mr. Hooper—and the marriage of Luis and Maria in 1988.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, \"Sesame Street\" faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in viewing habits of young children, competition from other shows, the development of cable television, and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, \"Sesame Street\" made major structural changes. For example, starting in 2002, its format became more narrative and included ongoing storylines. After its thirtieth anniversary in 1999, due to the popularity of the Muppet Elmo the show also incorporated a popular segment known as \"Elmo's World\". In 2009, the show was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.\n\nIn late 2015, in response to \"sweeping changes in the media business\", and as part of a five-year programming and development deal, premium television service HBO began airing first-run episodes of \"Sesame Street\". Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes, about 35 new episodes per season, compared to the 18 episodes per season it aired previously, and provided the opportunity to create a spinoff series with the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets and a new educational series.\n\nAs of the show's 50th anniversary in 2019, \"Sesame Street\" has produced over 4,500 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel has almost 5 million subscribers. It was announced in October 2019 that first-run episodes will move to HBO Max beginning with its 51st season in 2020.\n\nFrom its first episode, \"Sesame Street\" has structured its format by using \"a strong visual style, fast-moving action, humor, and music,\" as well as animation and live-action short films. When \"Sesame Street\" premiered, most researchers believed that young children did not have long attention spans; therefore, the new show's producers were concerned that an hour-long show would not hold their audience's attention. At first, the show's \"street scenes\"—the action taking place on its set—consisted of character-driven interactions and were not written as ongoing stories. Instead, they consisted of individual, curriculum-based segments which were interrupted by \"inserts\" consisting of puppet sketches, short films, and animations. This structure allowed the producers to use a mixture of styles and characters, and to vary the show's pace. By season 20, research had shown that children were able to follow a story, and the street scenes, while still interspersed with other segments, became evolving storylines.\n\nUpon recommendations by child psychologists, the producers initially decided that the show's human actors and Muppets would not interact because they were concerned it would confuse young children. When the CTW tested the appeal of the new show, they found that although children paid attention to the shows during the Muppet segments, their interest was lost during the \"Street\" segments. The producers requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to interact with the human actors, and the Street segments were re-shot. \"Sesame Street\"s format remained intact until the 2000s, when the changing audience required that producers move to a more narrative format. In 1998, the popular \"Elmo's World\", a 15-minute-long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo, was created. Starting in 2014, during the show's 45th season, the producers introduced a half-hour version of the program. The new version, which originally complemented the full-hour series, was both broadcast weekday afternoons and streamed on the Internet. In 2017, in response to the changing viewing habits of toddlers, the show's producers decreased the show's length from one hour to thirty minutes across all its broadcast platforms. The new version focused on fewer characters, reduced the pop culture references \"once included as winks for their parents\", and focused \"on a single backbone topic\".\n\nAuthor Malcolm Gladwell said that \"\"Sesame Street\" was built around a single, breakthrough insight: that if you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them\". Gerald S. Lesser, the CTW's first advisory board chair, went even further, saying that the effective use of television as an educational tool needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. \"Sesame Street\" was the first children's show to structure each episode, and the segments within them, to capture children's attention, and to make, as Gladwell put it, \"small but critical adjustments\" to keep it. According to CTW researchers Rosemarie Truglio and Shalom Fisch, \"Sesame Street\" was one of the few children's television programs to utilize a detailed and comprehensive educational curriculum, garnered from formative and summative research.\n\nThe creators of \"Sesame Street\" and their researchers formulated both cognitive and affective goals for the show. Initially, they focused on cognitive goals, while addressing affective goals indirectly, in the belief that doing so would increase children's self-esteem and feelings of competency. One of their primary goals was preparing young children for school, especially children from low-income families, using modeling, repetition, and humor to fulfill these goals. They made changes in the show's content to increase their viewers' attention and to increase its appeal, and encouraged \"co-viewing\" to encourage older children and parents to watch the show by including more sophisticated humor, cultural references, and celebrity guest appearances.\n\nAfter \"Sesame Street\"s first season, its critics forced its producers and researchers to address more overtly such affective goals as social competence, tolerance of diversity, and nonaggressive ways of resolving conflict. These issues were addressed through interpersonal disputes among its Street characters. During the 1980s, the show incorporated the real-life experiences of the show's cast and crew, including the death of Will Lee (Mr. Hooper) and the pregnancy of Sonia Manzano (Maria) to address affective concerns. In later seasons, \"Sesame Street\" addressed real-life disasters such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThe show's goals for outreach were addressed through a series of programs that first focused on promotion and then, after the first season, on the development of educational materials used in preschool settings. Innovative programs were developed because their target audience, children and their families in low-income, inner-city homes, did not traditionally watch educational programs on television and because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups.\n\nStarting in 2006, the Workshop expanded its outreach by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs focusing on how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. The Workshop's outreach efforts also focused on families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety. In 2013, SW started Sesame Street in Communities, a branch of their outreach efforts, to help families dealing with difficult issues.\n\nAs a result of Cooney's initial proposal in 1968, the Carnegie Institute awarded her an $1 million grant to create a new children's television program and establish the CTW, renamed in June 2000 to Sesame Workshop (SW). Cooney and Morrisett procured additional multimillion-dollar grants from the U.S. federal government, The Arthur Vining Davis Foundations, CPB, and the Ford Foundation. Davis reported that Cooney and Morrisett decided that if they did not procure full funding from the beginning, they would drop the idea of producing the show. As Lesser reported, funds gained from a combination of government agencies and private foundations protected them from the economic pressures experienced by commercial broadcast television networks, but created challenges in procuring future funding.\n\nAfter \"Sesame Street\"s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. From the first season, they understood that the source of their funding, which they considered \"seed\" money, would need to be replaced. The 1970s were marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of CTW's fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements with toy companies and other manufacturers, publishing, and international sales for their funding.\n\nIn 1998, the CTW accepted corporate sponsorship to raise funds for \"Sesame Street\" and other projects. For the first time, they allowed short advertisements by indoor playground manufacturer Discovery Zone, their first corporate sponsor, to air before and after each episode. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, who had previously appeared on \"Sesame Street\", called for a boycott of the show, saying that the CTW was \"exploiting impressionable children\". In 2015, in response to funding challenges, it was announced that premium television service HBO would air first-run episodes of \"Sesame Street\". Steve Youngwood, SW's Chief Operating Officer, called the move \"one of the toughest decisions we ever made\". According to \"The New York Times\", the move \"drew an immediate backlash\". Critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less-advantaged children and their families, the original focus of the show. They also criticized choosing to air first-run episodes on HBO, a network with adult dramas and comedies.\n\nProducer Joan Ganz Cooney has stated, \"Without research, there would be no \"Sesame Street\"\". \nIn 1967, when Cooney and her team began to plan the show's development, combining research with television production was, as she put it, \"positively heretical\". Shortly after creating \"Sesame Street\", its producers began to develop what came to be called \"the CTW model\", a system of planning, production, and evaluation that did not fully emerge until the end of the show's first season. According to Morrow, the CTW model consisted of four parts: \"the interaction of receptive television producers and child science experts, the creation of a specific and age-appropriate curriculum, research to shape the program directly, and independent measurement of viewers' learning\".\n\nCooney credited the show's high standard in research procedures to Harvard professors Gerald S. Lesser, who the CTW hired to design the show's educational objectives, and Edward L. Palmer, who was responsible for conducting the show's formative research and for bridging the gap between the show's producers and researchers. The CTW conducted research in two ways: in-house formative research that informed and improved production, and independent summative evaluations, conducted by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) during the show's first two seasons, which measured its educational effectiveness. Cooney stated, \"From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners\". Cooney also described the collaboration as an \"arranged marriage\".\n\n\"Sesame Street\" has used many writers in its long history. As Peter Hellman wrote in his 1987 article in \"New York Magazine\", \"The show, of course, depends upon its writers, and it isn't easy to find adults who could identify the interest level of a pre-schooler\". Fifteen writers a year worked on the show's scripts, but very few lasted longer than one season. Norman Stiles, head writer in 1987, reported that most writers would \"burn out\" after writing about a dozen scripts. According to Gikow, \"Sesame Street\" went against the convention of hiring teachers to write for the show, as most educational television programs did at the time. Instead, Cooney and the producers felt that it would be easier to teach writers how to interpret curriculum than to teach educators how to write comedy. As Stone stated, \"Writing for children is not so easy\". Long-time writer Tony Geiss agreed, stating in 2009, \"It's not an easy show to write. You have to know the characters and the format and how to teach and be funny at the same time, which is a big, ambidextrous stunt\".\n\nThe show's research team developed an annotated document, or \"Writer's Notebook\", which served as a bridge between the show's curriculum goals and script development. The notebook was a compilation of programming ideas designed to teach specific curriculum points, provided extended definitions of curriculum goals, and assisted the writers and producers in translating the goals into televised material. Suggestions in the notebook were free of references to specific characters and contexts on the show so that they could be implemented as openly and flexibly as possible.\n\nThe research team, in a series of meetings with the writers, also developed \"a curriculum sheet\" that described the show's goals and priorities for each season. After receiving the curriculum focus and goals for the season, the writers met to discuss ideas and story arcs for the characters, and an \"assignment sheet\" was created that suggested how much time was allotted for each goal and topic. When a script was completed, the show's research team analyzed it to ensure that the goals were met. Then each production department met to determine what each episode needed in terms of costumes, lights, and sets. The writers were present during the show's taping, which for the first twenty-four years of the show took place in Manhattan, and after 1992, at the Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens to make last-minute revisions when necessary.\n\nEarly in their history \"Sesame Street\" and the CTW began to look for alternative funding sources and turned to creating products and writing licensing agreements. They became, as Cooney put it, \"a multiple-media institution\". In 1970, the CTW created a \"non-broadcast\" division responsible for creating and publishing books and \"Sesame Street Magazine\". By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had published over 6,500 book titles. The Workshop decided from the start that all materials their licensing program created would \"underscore and amplify\" the show's curriculum. In 2004, over 68% of \"Sesame Street\"s revenue came from licenses and products such as toys and clothing. By 2008, the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets accounted for between $15 million and $17 million per year in licensing and merchandising fees, split between the Sesame Workshop and The Jim Henson Company. By 2019, the Sesame Workshop had over 500 licensing agreements and had produced over 200 hours of home video. There have been two theatrically-released \"Sesame Street\" movies, \"Follow That Bird\", released in 1985, and \"Elmo in Grouchland\", released in 1999. In early 2019, it was announced that a third film, a musical co-starring Anne Hathaway and written and directed by Jonathan Krisel, would be produced. In November 2019, Sesame Street announced a family friendly augmented reality application produced by Weyo in partnership with Sesame Workshop in honor of the show's 50th anniversary.\n\nJim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, owned the trademarks to those characters, and was reluctant to market them at first. He agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, computer games, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW and its outreach efforts. Even though Cooney and the CTW had very little experience with marketing, they demanded complete control over all products and product decisions. Any product line associated with the show had to be educational and inexpensive, and could not be advertised during the show's airings. As Davis reported, \"Cooney stressed restraint, prudence, and caution\" in their marketing and licensing efforts.\n\nDirector Jon Stone, talking about the music of \"Sesame Street\", said: \"There was no other sound like it on television\". For the first time in children's television, the show's songs fulfilled a specific purpose and supported its curriculum. In order to attract the best composers and lyricists, the CTW allowed songwriters like Joe Raposo, \"Sesame Street\"s first musical director, to retain the rights to the songs they wrote, which earned them lucrative profits and helped the show sustain public interest. By 2019, there were 180 albums of \"Sesame Street\" music produced, and its songwriters had received 11 Grammys. In late 2018, the SW announced a multi-year agreement with Warner Music Group to re-launch Sesame Street Records in the U.S. and Canada. For the first time in 20 years, \"an extensive catalog of \"Sesame Street\" recordings\" was made available to the public in a variety of formats, including CD and vinyl compilations, digital streaming, and downloads.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" used animations and short films commissioned from outside studios, interspersed throughout each episode, to help teach their viewers basic concepts like numbers and letters. Jim Henson was one of the many producers to create short films for the show. Shortly after \"Sesame Street\" debuted in the United States, the CTW was approached independently by producers from several countries to produce versions of the show at home. These versions came to be called \"co-productions\". By 2001 there were over 120 million viewers of all international versions of \"Sesame Street\", and in 2006, there were twenty co-productions around the world. By its 50th anniversary in 2019, 190 million children viewed over 160 versions of \"Sesame Street\" in 70 languages. In 2005, Doreen Carvajal of \"The New York Times\" reported that income from the co-productions and international licensing accounted for $96 million.\n\nShortly after the CTW was created in 1968, Joan Ganz Cooney was named its first executive director. She was one of the first female executives in American television. Her appointment was called \"one of the most important television developments of the decade\". She assembled a team of producers, all of whom had previously worked on \"Captain Kangaroo\". Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; Dave Connell took over animation; and Sam Gibbon served as the show's chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Cameraman Frankie Biondo worked on \"Sesame Street\" from its first episode.\n\nJim Henson and the Muppets' involvement in \"Sesame Street\" began when he and Cooney met at one of the curriculum planning seminars in Boston. Author Christopher Finch reported that Stone, who had worked with Henson previously, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should \"make do without puppets\". Henson was initially reluctant, but he agreed to join \"Sesame Street\" to meet his own social goals. He also agreed to waive his performance fee for full ownership of the \"Sesame Street\" Muppets and to split any revenue they generated with the CTW. As Morrow stated, Henson's puppets were a crucial part of the show's popularity and it brought Henson national attention. Davis reported that Henson was able to take \"arcane academic goals\" and translate them to \"effective and pleasurable viewing\". In early research, the Muppet segments of the show scored high, and more Muppets were added during the first few seasons. Morrow reported that the Muppets were effective teaching tools because children easily recognized them, they were stereotypical and predictable, and they appealed to adults and older siblings.\n\nAlthough the producers decided against depending upon a single host for \"Sesame Street\", instead casting a group of ethnically diverse actors, they realized that a children's television program needed to have, as Lesser put it, \"a variety of distinctive and reliable personalities\", both human and Muppet. Jon Stone, whose goal was to cast white actors in the minority, was responsible for hiring the show's first cast. He did not audition actors until Spring 1969, a few weeks before the five test shows were due to be filmed. Stone videotaped the auditions, and Ed Palmer took them out into the field to test children's reactions. The actors who received the \"most enthusiastic thumbs up\" were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of \"I'm a Little Teapot\". Stone stated that casting was the only aspect of the show that was \"just completely haphazard\". Most of the cast and crew found jobs on \"Sesame Street\" through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers. According to puppeteer Marty Robinson in 2019, longevity was common among the show's cast and crew.\nAccording to the CTW's research, children preferred watching and listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes. Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used, so these children were non-professionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult cast learned to handle the children's spontaneity flexibly, even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson. CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers. According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a \"fresh quality\", especially in its early years.\n\nWhen \"Sesame Street\" premiered in 1969, it aired on only 67.6% of American televisions, but it earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, which totaled 1.9 million households. By the show's tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of 6 were watching \"Sesame Street\" daily. According to a 1993 survey conducted by the U.S. Department of Education, out of the show's 6.6 million viewers, 2.4 million kindergartners regularly watched it. 77% of preschoolers watched it once a week, and 86% of kindergartners and first- and second-grade students had watched it once a week before starting school. The show reached most young children in almost all demographic groups.\n\nThe show's ratings significantly decreased in the early 1990s, due to changes in children's viewing habits and in the television marketplace. The producers responded by making large-scale structural changes to the show. By 2006, \"Sesame Street\" had become \"the most widely viewed children's television show in the world\", with 20 international independent versions and broadcasts in over 120 countries. A 1996 survey found that 95% of all American preschoolers had watched the show by the time they were three years old. In 2008, it was estimated that 77 million Americans had watched the series as children. By the show's 40th anniversary in 2009, it was ranked the fifteenth-most-popular children's show on television, and by its 50th anniversary in 2019, the show had 100% brand awareness globally. In 2018, the show was the second-highest-rated program on PBS Kids.\n\nAs of 2001, there were over 1,000 research studies regarding \"Sesame Street\"s efficacy, impact, and effect on American culture. The CTW solicited the Educational Testing Service (ETS) to conduct summative research on the show. ETS's two \"landmark\" summative evaluations, conducted in 1970 and 1971, demonstrated that the show had a significant educational impact on its viewers. These studies have been cited in other studies of the effects of television on young children. Additional studies conducted throughout \"Sesame Street\"s history demonstrated that the show continued to have a positive effect on its young viewers.\n\nLesser believed that \"Sesame Street\" research \"may have conferred a new respectability upon the studies of the effects of visual media upon children\". He also believed that the show had the same effect on the prestige of producing shows for children in the television industry. Historian Robert Morrow, in his book \"Sesame Street and the Reform of Children's Television\", which chronicled the show's influence on children's television and on the television industry as a whole, reported that many critics of commercial television saw \"Sesame Street\" as a \"straightforward illustration for reform\". Les Brown, a writer for \"Variety\", saw in \"Sesame Street\" \"a hope for a more substantial future\" for television.\n\nMorrow reported that the networks responded by creating more high-quality television programs, but that many critics saw them as \"appeasement gestures\". According to Morrow, despite the CTW Model's effectiveness in creating a popular show, commercial television \"made only a limited effort to emulate CTW's methods\", and did not use a curriculum or evaluate what children learned from them. By the mid-1970s commercial television had abandoned their experiments with creating better children's programming. Other critics hoped that \"Sesame Street\", with its depiction of a functioning, multicultural community, would nurture racial tolerance in its young viewers. It was not until the mid-1990s that another children's television educational program, \"Blue's Clues\", used the CTW's methods to create and modify their content. The creators of \"Blue's Clues\" were influenced by \"Sesame Street\", but wanted to use research conducted in the 30 years since its debut. Angela Santomero, one of its producers, said, \"We wanted to learn from \"Sesame Street\" and take it one step further\".\n\nCritic Richard Roeper said that perhaps one of the strongest indicators of the influence of \"Sesame Street\" has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially speculation concerning the sexuality of Bert and Ernie.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" was praised from its debut in 1969. \"Newsday\" reported that several newspapers and magazines had written \"glowing\" reports about the CTW and Cooney. The press overwhelmingly praised the new show; several popular magazines and niche magazines lauded it. In 1970, \"Sesame Street\" won twenty awards, including a Peabody Award, three Emmys, an award from the Public Relations Society of America, a Clio, and a Prix Jeunesse. By 1995, the show had won two Peabody Awards and four Parents' Choice Awards. In addition, it was the subject of retrospectives at the Smithsonian Institution and the Museum of Modern Art.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" was not without its detractors, however. The state commission in Mississippi, where Henson was from, operated the state's PBS member station; in May 1970 it voted to not air \"Sesame Street\" because of its \"highly [racially] integrated cast of children\" which \"the commission members felt ... Mississippi was not yet ready for\". According to \"\", Lesser's account of the development and early years of \"Sesame Street\", there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. Historian Robert W. Morrow speculated that much of the early criticism, which he called \"surprisingly intense\", stemmed from cultural and historical reasons in regards to, as he put it, \"the place of children in American society and the controversies about television's effects on them\".\n\nAccording to Morrow, the \"most important\" studies finding negative effects of \"Sesame Street\" were conducted by educator Herbert A. Sprigle and psychologist Thomas D. Cook during its first two seasons. Social scientist and Head Start founder Urie Bronfenbrenner criticized the show for being too wholesome. Psychologist Leon Eisenberg saw \"Sesame Street\"s urban setting as \"superficial\" and having little to do with the problems confronted by the inner-city child. Head Start director Edward Zigler was probably \"Sesame Street\"s most vocal critic in the show's early years.\n\nIn spite of their commitment to multiculturalism, the CTW experienced conflicts with the leadership of minority groups, especially Latino groups and feminists, who objected to \"Sesame Street\"s depiction of Latinos and women. The CTW took steps to address their objections. By 1971, the CTW hired Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers, and by the mid-1970s, Morrow reported that \"the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words\". As \"The New York Times\" has stated, creating strong female characters \"that make kids laugh, but not...as female stereotypes\" has been a challenge for the producers of \"Sesame Street\". According to Morrow, change regarding how women and girls were depicted on \"Sesame Street\" occurred slowly. As more female Muppet performers like Camille Bonora, Fran Brill, Pam Arciero, Carmen Osbahr, Stephanie D'Abruzzo, Jennifer Barnhart, and Leslie Carrara-Rudolph were hired and trained, stronger female characters like Rosita and Abby Cadabby were created.\n\nIn 2002, \"Sesame Street\" was ranked number 27 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. Sesame Workshop won a Peabody Award in 2009 for its website, sesamestreet.org, and the show was given Peabody's Institutional Award in 2019 for 50 years of educating and entertaining children globally. in 2013, \"TV Guide\" ranked the show number 30 on its list of the 60 best TV series. As of 2018, \"Sesame Street\" has received 189 Emmy Awards, more than any other television series.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29838", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29838", "title": "The Simpsons", "text": "The Simpsons\n\nThe Simpsons is an American animated sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The series is a satirical depiction of working-class life, epitomized by the Simpson family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield and parodies American culture and society, television, and the human condition.\n\nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of animated shorts with producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after his own family members, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987. After three seasons, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and became Fox's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–90).\n\nSince its debut on December 17, 1989, episodes of \"The Simpsons\" have been broadcast. It is the longest-running American sitcom, and the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, both in terms of seasons and number of episodes. \"The Simpsons Movie\", a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. Then on October 30, 2007, a video game was released. Currently, \"The Simpsons\" finished airing its thirtieth season, which began airing September 30, 2018. \"The Simpsons\" was renewed for a thirty-first and thirty-second season on February 6, 2019, the latter of which will contain the 700th episode. \"The Simpsons\" is a joint production by Gracie Films and 20th Century Fox Television and syndicated by 20th Television.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" received acclaim throughout its first nine or ten seasons, which are generally considered its \"Golden Age\". \"Time\" named it the 20th century's best television series, and Erik Adams of \"The A.V. Club\" named it \"television's crowning achievement regardless of format\". On January 14, 2000, the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards, and a Peabody Award. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase \"D'oh!\" has been adopted into the English language, while \"The Simpsons\" has influenced many other later adult-oriented animated sitcoms. However, it has also been criticized for a perceived decline in quality over the years.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" is known for its wide ensemble of main and supporting characters.\n\nThe main characters are the Simpson family, who live in a fictional \"Middle America\" town of Springfield. Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, a position at odds with his careless, buffoonish personality. He is married to Marge Bouvier, a stereotypical American housewife and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker and prankster; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and Maggie, the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a pacifier. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another. Homer's dad Grampa Simpson lives in the Springfield Retirement Home after Homer forced his dad to sell his house so that his family could buy theirs. Grampa Simpson has had starring roles in several episodes.\n\nThe family also owns a dog, Santa's Little Helper, and a cat, Snowball V, renamed Snowball II in \"I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot\". Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes.\nThe show includes an array of quirky supporting characters, which include Homer's co-workers (also friends) Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson, the school principal Seymour Skinner and teachers Edna Krabappel and Elizabeth Hoover, neighbor Ned Flanders, friends Barney Gumble, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Moe Szyslak, Milhouse Van Houten, and Nelson Muntz, extended relatives Patty and Selma Bouvier, townspeople such as Mayor Quimby, Chief Clancy Wiggum, tycoon Charles Montgomery Burns and his executive assistant Waylon Smithers, and local celebrities Krusty the Clown and news reporter Kent Brockman.\n\nThe creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show \"SCTV\".\n\nDespite the depiction of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays passing, the characters do not age between episodes (either physically or in stated age), and generally appear just as they did when the series began. The series uses a floating timeline in which episodes generally take place in the year the episode is produced even though the characters do not age. Flashbacks and flashforwards do occasionally depict the characters at other points in their lives, with the timeline of these depictions also generally floating relative to the year the episode is produced. For example, in the 1991 episode \"I Married Marge\", Bart (who is always 10 years old) appears to be born in 1980 or 1981. But in the 1995 episode \"And Maggie Makes Three\", Maggie (who always appears to be around 1 year old) appears to be born in 1993 or 1994. In the 1992 episode \"Lisa's First Word\", Lisa (who is always 8) is shown to have been born in 1984.\n\nA canon of the show does exist, although \"Treehouse of Horror\" episodes and any fictional story told within the series are typically non-canon. However, continuity is inconsistent and limited in \"The Simpsons\". For example, Krusty the Clown may be able to read in one episode, but may not be able to read in another. Lessons learned by the family in one episode may be forgotten in the next. Some examples of limited continuity include Sideshow Bob's appearances where Bart and Lisa flashback at all the crimes he committed in Springfield or when the characters try to remember things that happened in previous episodes.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" takes place in the fictional American town of Springfield in an unknown and impossible-to-determine U.S. state. The show is intentionally evasive in regard to Springfield's location. Springfield's geography, and that of its surroundings, contains coastlines, deserts, vast farmland, tall mountains, or whatever the story or joke requires. Groening has said that Springfield has much in common with Portland, Oregon, the city where he grew up. The name \"Springfield\" is a common one in America and appears in at least 29 states. Groening has said that he named it after Springfield, Oregon, and the fictitious Springfield which was the setting of the series \"Father Knows Best\". He \"figured out that Springfield was one of the most common names for a city in the U.S. In anticipation of the success of the show, I thought, 'This will be cool; everyone will think it's their Springfield.' And they do.\"\n\nWhen producer James L. Brooks was working on the television variety show \"The Tracey Ullman Show\", he decided to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist Matt Groening's \"Life in Hell\" comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts. Groening initially intended to present an animated version of his \"Life in Hell\" series. However, Groening later realized that animating \"Life in Hell\" would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a dysfunctional family that became the Simpsons. He named the characters after his own family members, substituting \"Bart\" for his own name, adopting an anagram of the word \"brat\".\n\nThe Simpson family first appeared as shorts in \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" on April 19, 1987. Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts. The animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo, with Wes Archer, David Silverman, and Bill Kopp being animators for the first season. Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.\n\nIn 1989, a team of production companies adapted \"The Simpsons\" into a half-hour series for the Fox Broadcasting Company. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content. Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called \"the mainstream trash\" that they were watching. The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989, with \"Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire\". \"Some Enchanted Evening\" was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems. In 1992, Tracey Ullman filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of \"The Simpsons\"—a claim rejected by the courts.\n\nMatt Groening and James L. Brooks have served as executive producers during the show's entire history, and also function as creative consultants. Sam Simon, described by former \"Simpsons\" director Brad Bird as \"the unsung hero\" of the show, served as creative supervisor for the first four seasons. He was constantly at odds with Groening, Brooks and the show's production company Gracie Films and left in 1993. Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that sees him receive a share of the profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993, at least until his passing in 2015. A more involved position on the show is the showrunner, who acts as head writer and manages the show's production for an entire season.\n\nThe first team of writers, assembled by Sam Simon, consisted of John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, George Meyer, Jeff Martin, Al Jean, Mike Reiss, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky. Newer \"Simpsons\" writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning of each December. The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show's vocal performers. Until 2004, George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time writer Jon Vitti, Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits. Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events.\n\nCredited with sixty episodes, John Swartzwelder is the most prolific writer on \"The Simpsons\". One of the best-known former writers is Conan O'Brien, who contributed to several episodes in the early 1990s before replacing David Letterman as host of the talk show \"Late Night\". English comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode \"Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife\", becoming the first celebrity to both write and guest star in the same episode. Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, writers of the film \"Superbad\", wrote the episode \"Homer the Whopper\", with Rogen voicing a character in it.\n\nAt the end of 2007, the writers of \"The Simpsons\" went on strike together with the other members of the Writers Guild of America, East. The show's writers had joined the guild in 1998.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has six main cast members: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, and Harry Shearer. Castellaneta voices Homer Simpson, Grampa Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Barney Gumble, and other adult, male characters. Julie Kavner voices Marge Simpson and Patty and Selma, as well as several minor characters. Castellaneta and Kavner had been a part of \"The Tracey Ullman Show\" cast and were given the parts so that new actors would not be needed. Cartwright voices Bart Simpson, Nelson Muntz, Ralph Wiggum and other children. Smith, the voice of Lisa Simpson, is the only cast member who regularly voices only one character, although she occasionally plays other episodic characters. The producers decided to hold casting for the roles of Bart and Lisa. Smith had initially been asked to audition for the role of Bart, but casting director Bonita Pietila believed her voice was too high, so she was given the role of Lisa instead. Cartwright was originally brought in to voice Lisa, but upon arriving at the audition, she found that Lisa was simply described as the \"middle child\" and at the time did not have much personality. Cartwright became more interested in the role of Bart, who was described as \"devious, underachieving, school-hating, irreverent, [and] clever\". Groening let her try out for the part instead, and upon hearing her read, gave her the job on the spot. Cartwright is the only one of the six main \"Simpsons\" cast members who had been professionally trained in voice acting prior to working on the show. Azaria and Shearer do not voice members of the title family, but play a majority of the male townspeople. Azaria, who has been a part of the \"Simpsons\" regular voice cast since the second season, voices recurring characters such as Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon and Professor Frink. Shearer provides voices for Mr. Burns, Mr. Smithers, Principal Skinner, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy and Dr. Hibbert. Every main cast member has won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance.\n\nWith one exception, episode credits list only the voice actors, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists. However, the network eventually revealed which roles each actor performed in the episode \"Old Money\", because the producers said the voice actors should receive credit for their work. In 2003, the cast appeared in an episode of \"Inside the Actors Studio\", doing live performances of their characters' voices.\n\nThe six main actors were paid $30,000 per episode until 1998, when they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action. The issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode. The show's revenue continued to rise through syndication and DVD sales, and in April 2004 the main cast stopped appearing for script readings, demanding they be paid $360,000 per episode. The strike was resolved a month later and their salaries were increased to something between $250,000 and $360,000 per episode. In 2008, production for the twentieth season was put on hold due to new contract negotiations with the voice actors, who wanted a \"healthy bump\" in salary to an amount close to $500,000 per episode. The negotiations were soon completed, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. Three years later, with Fox threatening to cancel the series unless production costs were cut, the cast members accepted a 30 percent pay cut, down to just over $300,000 per episode.\n\nIn addition to the main cast, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille, Marcia Wallace, Maggie Roswell, and Russi Taylor voice supporting characters. From 1999 to 2002, Roswell's characters were voiced by Marcia Mitzman Gaven. Karl Wiedergott has also appeared in minor roles, but does not voice any recurring characters. Wiedergott left the show in 2010, and since then Chris Edgerly has appeared regularly to voice minor characters. Repeat \"special guest\" cast members include Albert Brooks, Phil Hartman, Jon Lovitz, Joe Mantegna, Maurice LaMarche, and Kelsey Grammer. Following Hartman's death in 1998, the characters he voiced (Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz) were retired; Wallace's character of Edna Krabappel was retired as well after her death in 2013.\n\nEpisodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode \"Dancin' Homer\". \"The Simpsons\" holds the world record for \"Most Guest Stars Featured in a Television Series\".\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has been dubbed into several other languages, including Japanese, German, Spanish, and Portuguese. It is also one of the few programs dubbed in both standard French and Quebec French. The show has been broadcast in Arabic, but due to Islamic customs, numerous aspects of the show have been changed. For example, Homer drinks soda instead of beer and eats Egyptian beef sausages instead of hot dogs. Because of such changes, the Arabized version of the series met with a negative reaction from the lifelong \"Simpsons\" fans in the area.\n\nSeveral different U.S. and international studios animate \"The Simpsons\". Throughout the run of the animated shorts on \"The Tracey Ullman Show,\" the animation was produced domestically at Klasky Csupo. With the debut of the series, because of an increased workload, Fox subcontracted production to several local and foreign studios. These are AKOM, Anivision, Rough Draft Studios, USAnimation, and Toonzone Entertainment.\n\nFor the first three seasons, Klasky Csupo animated \"The Simpsons\" in the United States. In 1992, the show's production company, Gracie Films, switched domestic production to Film Roman, who continued to animate the show until 2016. In Season 14, production switched from traditional cel animation to digital ink and paint. The first episode to experiment with digital coloring was \"Radioactive Man\" in 1995. Animators used digital ink and paint during production of the season 12 episode \"Tennis the Menace\", but Gracie Films delayed the regular use of digital ink and paint until two seasons later. The already completed \"Tennis the Menace\" was broadcast as made.\n\nThe production staff at the U.S. animation studio, Film Roman, draws storyboards, designs new characters, backgrounds, props and draws character and background layouts, which in turn become animatics to be screened for the writers at Gracie Films for any changes to be made before the work is shipped overseas. The overseas studios then draw the inbetweens, ink and paint, and render the animation to tape before it is shipped back to the United States to be delivered to Fox three to four months later.\n\nThe series began high-definition production in Season 20; the first episode, \"Take My Life, Please\", aired February 15, 2009. The move to HDTV included a new opening sequence. Matt Groening called it a complicated change because it affected the timing and composition of animation.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town, serving as a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle. However, because of its animated nature, \"The Simpsons\" scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment. Through Bart and Lisa's days at Springfield Elementary School, the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.\n\nSome commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias. Al Jean acknowledged in an interview that \"We [the show] are of liberal bent.\" The writers often evince an appreciation for liberal ideals, but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum. The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker. Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In \"The Simpsons\", politicians are corrupt, ministers such as Reverend Lovejoy are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent. Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" opening sequence is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. The standard opening has gone through three iterations (a replacement of some shots at the start of the second season, and a brand new sequence when the show switched to high-definition in 2009).\n\nEach has the same basic sequence of events: the camera zooms through cumulus clouds, through the show's title towards the town of Springfield. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The original opening was created by David Silverman, and was the first task he did when production began on the show. The series' distinctive theme song was composed by musician Danny Elfman in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece. This piece has been noted by Elfman as the most popular of his career.\n\nOne of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone (or occasionally a different instrument), and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.\n\nThe special Halloween episode has become an annual tradition. \"Treehouse of Horror\" first broadcast in 1990 as part of season two and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode. These pieces usually involve the family in some horror, science fiction, or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres. They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the \"Treehouse\" series is meant to be seen on Halloween, this changed by the 2000s, when new installments have premiered after Halloween due to Fox's current contract with Major League Baseball's World Series, however, since 2011, every \"Treehouse of Horror\" episode has aired in October.\n\nThe show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show. Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history. The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, billboards, and elsewhere. The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show or viewing it in slow motion. Kristin Thompson argues that \"The Simpsons\" uses a \"flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.\"\n\nOne of Bart's early hallmarks was his prank calls to Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a gag name. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based on a series of prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.\nMoe was based partly on Tube Bar owner Louis \"Red\" Deutsch, whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side. As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season. \"The Simpsons\" also often includes self-referential humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting. For example, the episode \"She Used to Be My Girl\" included a scene in which a Fox News Channel van drove down the street while displaying a large \"Bush Cheney 2004\" banner and playing Queen's \"We Are the Champions\", in reference to the 2004 U.S. presidential election and claims of conservative bias in Fox News.\n\nThe show uses catchphrases, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each. Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt \"D'oh!\", Mr. Burns' \"Excellent\" and Nelson Muntz's \"\"Ha\"-ha!\" Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as \"¡Ay, caramba!\", \"Don't have a cow, man!\" and \"Eat my shorts!\" appeared on T-shirts in the show's early days. However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the merchandising. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode \"Bart Gets Famous\" mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the \"Krusty the Clown Show\" solely for saying \"I didn't do it.\"\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has gained notoriety for jokes that eventually became reality. Perhaps the most famous example comes from the episode \"Bart to the Future\", which mentions billionaire Donald Trump having been President of the United States at one time and leaving the nation broke. The episode first aired in 2000, sixteen years before Trump was elected. Another episode, \"When You Dish Upon a Star\", lampooned 20th Century Fox as a division of The Walt Disney Company. Nineteen years later, Disney purchased Fox. Other examples of \"The Simpsons\" predicting the future include the introduction of the Smartwatch, video chat services, autocorrection technology, and Lady Gaga's acrobatic performance at the Super Bowl LI halftime show. Conversely, some fact-checking sources such as Snopes have debunked many of these claims, including the aforementioned Lady Gaga one.\n\nA number of neologisms that originated on \"The Simpsons\" have entered popular vernacular. Mark Liberman, director of the Linguistic Data Consortium, remarked, \"\"The Simpsons\" has apparently taken over from Shakespeare and the Bible as our culture's greatest source of idioms, catchphrases and sundry other textual allusions.\" The most famous catchphrase is Homer's annoyed grunt: \"D'oh!\" So ubiquitous is the expression that it is now listed in the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", but without the apostrophe. Dan Castellaneta says he borrowed the phrase from James Finlayson, an actor in many Laurel and Hardy comedies, who pronounced it in a more elongated and whining tone. The staff of \"The Simpsons\" told Castellaneta to shorten the noise, and it went on to become the well-known exclamation in the television series.\n\nGroundskeeper Willie's description of the French as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\" was used by \"National Review\" columnist Jonah Goldberg in 2003, after France's opposition to the proposed invasion of Iraq. The phrase quickly spread to other journalists. \"\" and \"embiggen\", words used in \"Lisa the Iconoclast\", have since appeared in the Dictionary.com's 21st Century Lexicon, and scientific journals respectively. \"Kwyjibo\", a fake Scrabble word invented by Bart in \"Bart the Genius\", was used as one of the aliases of the creator of the Melissa worm. \"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords\", was used by Kent Brockman in \"Deep Space Homer\" and has become a snowclone, with variants of the utterance used to express obsequious submission. It has been used in media, such as \"New Scientist\" magazine. The dismissive term \"Meh\", believed to have been popularized by the show, entered the Collins English Dictionary in 2008. Other words credited as stemming from the show include \"yoink\" and \"craptacular\".\n\n\"The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations\" includes several quotations from the show. As well as \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys\", Homer's lines, \"Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is never try\", from \"Burns' Heir\" (season five, 1994) as well as \"Kids are the best, Apu. You can teach them to hate the things you hate. And they practically raise themselves, what with the Internet and all\", from \"Eight Misbehavin'\" (season 11, 1999), entered the dictionary in August 2007.\n\nMany quotes/scenes have become popular internet memes, including Jasper Beardley‘s quote \"That's a paddlin’\" from The PTA Disbands (season 6, 1995) and Steamed Hams from 22 Short Films About Springfield (season 7, 1996).\n\n\"The Simpsons\" was the first successful animated program in American prime time since \"Wait Till Your Father Gets Home\" in the 1970s. During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. \"The Simpsons\" changed this perception, initially leading to a short period where networks attempted to recreate prime-time cartoon success with shows like \"Capitol Critters\", \"Fish Police\", and \"Family Dog\", which were expensive and unsuccessful. \"The Simpsons\" use of Korean animation studios for tweening, coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of \"The Simpsons\" and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other adult animated series. This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows for adults, such as \"Beavis and Butt-Head\", \"South Park\", \"Family Guy\", \"King of the Hill\", \"Futurama\" and \"The Critic\". For \"Family Guy\" creator Seth MacFarlane, \"\"The Simpsons\" created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years ... As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium.\"\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has had crossovers with four other shows. In the episode \"A Star Is Burns\", Marge invites Jay Sherman, the main character of \"The Critic\", to be a judge for a film festival in Springfield. Matt Groening had his name removed from the episode since he had no involvement with \"The Critic\". \"South Park\" later paid homage to \"The Simpsons\" with the episode \"Simpsons Already Did It\". In \"Simpsorama\", the Planet Express crew from \"Futurama\" come to Springfield in the present to prevent the Simpsons from destroying the future. In the \"Family Guy\" episode \"The Simpsons Guy\", the Griffins visit Springfield and meet the Simpsons.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has also influenced live-action shows like \"Malcolm in the Middle\", which featured the use of sight gags and did not use a laugh track unlike most sitcoms. \"Malcolm in the Middle\" debuted January 9, 2000, in the time slot after \"The Simpsons\". Ricky Gervais called \"The Simpsons\" an influence on \"The Office\", and fellow British sitcom \"Spaced\" was, according to its director Edgar Wright, \"an attempt to do a live-action \"The Simpsons\".\" In Georgia, the animated television sitcom \"The Samsonadzes\", launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with \"The Simpsons\", which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" was the Fox network's first television series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. In 1990, Bart quickly became one of the most popular characters on television in what was termed \"Bartmania\". He became the most prevalent \"Simpsons\" character on memorabilia, such as T-shirts. In the early 1990s, millions of T-shirts featuring Bart were sold; as many as one million were sold on some days. Believing Bart to be a bad role model, several American public schools banned T-shirts featuring Bart next to captions such as \"I'm Bart Simpson. Who the hell are you?\" and \"Underachiever ('And proud of it, man!')\". \"The Simpsons\" merchandise sold well and generated $2 billion in revenue during the first 14 months of sales. Because of his popularity, Bart was often the most promoted member of the Simpson family in advertisements for the show, even for episodes in which he was not involved in the main plot.\n\nDue to the show's success, over the summer of 1990 the Fox Network decided to switch \"The Simpsons\" time slot from 8:00 p.m. ET on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday, where it competed with \"The Cosby Show\" on NBC, the number one show at the time. Through the summer, several news outlets published stories about the supposed \"Bill vs. Bart\" rivalry. \"Bart Gets an F\" (season two, 1990) was the first episode to air against \"The Cosby Show\", and it received a lower Nielsen ratings, tying for eighth behind \"The Cosby Show\", which had an 18.5 rating. The rating is based on the number of household televisions that were tuned into the show, but Nielsen Media Research estimated that 33.6 million viewers watched the episode, making it the number one show in terms of actual viewers that week. At the time, it was the most watched episode in the history of the Fox Network, and it is still the highest rated episode in the history of \"The Simpsons\". The show moved back to its Sunday slot in 1994 and has remained there ever since.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics, and it has been noted for being described as \"the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air.\" In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" described it as \"the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons. It's this neat paradox that makes millions of people turn away from the three big networks on Sunday nights to concentrate on The Simpsons.\" Tucker also described the show as a \"pop-cultural phenomenon, a prime-time cartoon show that appeals to the entire family.\"\n\nOn February 9, 1997, \"The Simpsons\" surpassed \"The Flintstones\" with the episode \"The Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show\" as the longest-running prime-time animated series in the United States. In 2004, \"The Simpsons\" replaced \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" (1952 to 1966) as the longest-running sitcom (animated or live action) in the United States. In 2009, \"The Simpsons\" surpassed \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\"s record of 435 episodes and is now recognized by \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's longest running sitcom (in terms of episode count). In October 2004, \"Scooby-Doo\" briefly overtook \"The Simpsons\" as the American animated show with the highest number of episodes (albeit under several different iterations). However, network executives in April 2005 again cancelled \"Scooby-Doo\", which finished with 371 episodes, and \"The Simpsons\" reclaimed the title with 378 episodes at the end of their seventeenth season. In May 2007, \"The Simpsons\" reached their 400th episode at the end of the eighteenth season. While \"The Simpsons\" has the record for the number of episodes by an American animated show, other animated series have surpassed \"The Simpsons\". For example, the Japanese anime series \"Sazae-san\" has over 7,000 episodes to its credit.\n\nIn 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled \"Best. 20 Years. Ever.\" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of \"The Simpsons\". One of the first parts of the celebration is the \"Unleash Your Yellow\" contest in which entrants must design a poster for the show. The celebration ended on January 10, 2010 (almost 20 years after \"Bart the Genius\" aired on January 14, 1990), with \"The Simpsons 20th Anniversary Special – In 3-D! On Ice!\", a documentary special by documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock that examines the \"cultural phenomenon of \"The Simpsons\"\".\n\nAs of the twenty-first season (2009–2010), \"The Simpsons\" became the longest-running American scripted primetime television series, having surpassed the 1955–1975 run of \"Gunsmoke\". On April 29, 2018, \"The Simpsons\" also surpassed \"Gunsmoke\"s 635-episode count with the episode \"Forgive and Regret.\"\n\nOn February 6, 2019, it was announced that \"The Simpsons\" has been renewed for Seasons 31 and 32.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 34 Primetime Emmy Awards, 34 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. In a 1999 issue celebrating the 20th century's greatest achievements in arts and entertainment, \"Time\" magazine named \"The Simpsons\" the century's best television series. In that same issue, \"Time\" included Bart Simpson in the \"\", the publication's list of the century's 100 most influential people. Bart was the only fictional character on the list. On January 14, 2000, the Simpsons were awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Also in 2000, \"Entertainment Weekly\" magazine TV critic Ken Tucker named \"The Simpsons\" the greatest television show of the 1990s. Furthermore, viewers of the UK television channel Channel 4 have voted \"The Simpsons\" at the top of two polls: 2001's 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows, and 2005's The 100 Greatest Cartoons, with Homer Simpson voted into first place in 2001's 100 Greatest TV Characters. Homer also placed ninth on \"Entertainment Weekly\" list of the \"50 Greatest TV icons\". In 2002, \"The Simpsons\" ranked #8 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and was ranked the #6 cult show in 2004. In 2007, it moved to #8 on TV Guide's cult shows list and was included in \"Time\" list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\". In 2008 the show was placed in first on \"Entertainment Weekly\" \"Top 100 Shows of the Past 25 Years\". \"Empire\" named it the greatest TV show of all time. In 2010, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named Homer \"the greatest character of the last 20 years\", while in 2013 the Writers Guild of America listed \"The Simpsons\" as the 11th \"best written\" series in television history. In 2013, TV Guide ranked \"The Simpsons\" as the greatest TV cartoon of all time and the tenth greatest show of all time. A 2015 \"The Hollywood Reporter\" survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named it as their #10 favorite show. In 2015, British newspaper \"The Telegraph\" named \"The Simpsons\" as one of the 10 best TV sitcoms of all time. Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked \"The Simpsons\" as the greatest American TV series of all time in their 2016 book \"\".\n\nBart's rebellious, bad boy nature, which underlies his misbehavior and rarely leads to any punishment, led some people to characterize him as a poor role model for children. In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a \"threat to learning\" because of his \"underachiever and proud of it\" attitude and negative attitude regarding his education. Others described him as \"egotistical, aggressive and mean-spirited\". In a 1991 interview, Bill Cosby described Bart as a bad role model for children, calling him \"angry, confused, frustrated\". In response, Matt Groening said, \"That sums up Bart, all right. Most people are in a struggle to be normal [and] he thinks normal is very boring, and does things that others just wished they dare do.\" On January 27, 1992, then-President George H. W. Bush said, \"We are going to keep on trying to strengthen the American family, to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\" The writers rushed out a tongue-in-cheek reply in the form of a short segment which aired three days later before a rerun of \"Stark Raving Dad\" in which Bart replied, \"Hey, we're just like the Waltons. We're praying for an end to the Depression, too.\"\n\nVarious episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in \"Bart vs. Australia\" (season six, 1995) and Brazil in \"Blame It on Lisa\" (season 13, 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries. In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board—which claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations—went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action. Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode \"A Star Is Burns\" (season six, 1995) which featured a crossover with \"The Critic\". He felt that it was just an advertisement for \"The Critic\", and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode \"violates the Simpsons' universe.\" In response, Brooks said, \"I am furious with Matt, ... he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far. ... his behavior right now is rotten.\"\n\n\"The Principal and the Pauper\" (season nine, 1997) is one of the most controversial episodes of \"The Simpsons\". Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that Seymour Skinner, a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by Harry Shearer, who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, \"That's \"so\" wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.\"\n\nThe show has reportedly been taken off the air in several countries. China banned it from prime-time television in August 2006, \"in an effort to protect China's struggling animation studios.\" In 2008, Venezuela barred the show from airing on morning television as it was deemed \"unsuitable for children\". The same year, several Russian Pentecostal churches demanded that \"The Simpsons\", \"South Park\" and some other Western cartoons be removed from broadcast schedules \"for propaganda of various vices\" and the broadcaster's license to be revoked. However, the court decision later dismissed this request.\n\nCritics' reviews of early \"Simpsons\" episodes praised the show for its sassy humor, wit, realism, and intelligence. However, in the late 1990s, around the airing of season 10, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show \"tired\". By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show, and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics. Jim Schembri of \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" attributed the decline in quality to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favor of and overuse of celebrity cameo appearances and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote in 2011: \"The central tragedy of \"The Simpsons\" is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention-seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.\"\n\nIn 2010, the BBC noted \"the common consensus is that \"The Simpsons\" golden era ended after season nine\", and Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated \"for many fans ... the glory days are long past.\" Similarly, Tyler Wilson of \"Coeur d'Alene Press\" has referred to seasons one to nine as the show's \"golden age\", and Ian Nathan of \"Empire\" described the show's classic era as being \"say, the first ten seasons.\" Jon Heacock of LucidWorks stated that \"for the first ten years [seasons], the show was consistently at the top of its game\", with \"so many moments, quotations, and references – both epic and obscure – that helped turn the Simpson family into the cultural icons that they remain to this day.\"\n\nMike Scully, who was showrunner during seasons nine through twelve, has been the subject of criticism. Chris Suellentrop of \"Slate\" wrote that \"under Scully's tenure, \"The Simpsons\" became, well, a cartoon ... Episodes that once would have ended with Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset now end with Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck. The show's still funny, but it hasn't been touching in years.\" When asked in 2007 how the series' longevity is sustained, Scully joked: \"Lower your quality standards. Once you've done that you can go on forever.\"\n\nAl Jean, showrunner since season thirteen, has also been the subject of criticism, with some arguing that the show has continued to decline in quality under his tenure. Former writers have complained that under Jean, the show is \"on auto-pilot\", \"too sentimental\", and the episodes are \"just being cranked out.\" Some critics believe that the show has \"entered a steady decline under Jean and is no longer really funny.\" John Ortved, author of \"\", characterized the Jean era as \"toothless\", and criticized what he perceived as the show's increase in social and political commentary. Jean responded: \"Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't.\"\n\nIn 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: \"I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now.\" Dan Castellaneta responded: \"I don't agree, ... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.\" Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as \"hogwash\", saying \"\"The Simpsons\" hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.\" In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: \"I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome ... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit.\"\n\nIn 2016, popular culture writer Anna Leszkiewicz suggested that even though \"The Simpsons\" still holds cultural relevance, contemporary appeal is only for the first ten seasons, with recent episodes only garnering mainstream attention when a favorite character from the golden era is killed off, or when new information and shock twists are given for old characters. The series' ratings have also declined; while the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewing households per episode in the U.S., the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2 million viewers.\n\nAlan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz argued in their 2016 book titled \"TV (The Book)\" that the peak of \"The Simpsons\" are \"roughly seasons [three through twelve]\", and that despite the decline, episodes from the later seasons such as \"Eternal Moonshine of the Simpson Mind\" and \"Holidays of Future Passed\" could be considered on par with the earlier classic episodes, further stating that \"even if you want to call the show today a thin shadow of its former self, think about how mind-boggingly great its former self had to be for so-diminished a version to be watchable at all.\"\n\nThe stereotypical nature of the character Apu Nahasapeemapetilon has long been the subject of controversy. This was particularly highlighted by Indian-American comedian Hari Kondabolu's 2017 documentary \"The Problem with Apu\". In the film, Kondabolu states that as a child he was a fan of The Simpsons and liked Apu, but he now finds the character's stereotypical nature troublesome. Defenders of the character responded that the show is built on comical stereotypes, with creator Matt Groening saying, \"that's the nature of cartooning.\" He added that he was \"proud of what we do on the show\", and \"it's a time in our culture where people love to pretend they're offended\". In response to the controversy, Apu's voice actor, Hank Azaria, said he was willing to step aside from his role as Apu: \"The most important thing is to listen to South Asian people, Indian people in this country when they talk about what they feel and how they think about this character.\"\n\nThe criticisms were referenced in the season 29 episode \"No Good Read Goes Unpunished\", when Lisa breaks the fourth wall and addresses the audience by saying, \"Something that started decades ago and was applauded and inoffensive is now politically incorrect. What can you do?\" to which Marge replies, \"Some things will be addressed at a later date.\" Lisa adds, \"If at all.\" This reference was clarified by the fact that there was a framed photo of Apu with the caption on the photo saying \"Don't have a cow, Apu\", a play on Bart's catchphrase \"Don't have a cow, man,\" as well as the fact that Hindus do not eat cows as they are considered sacred. In October 2018, it was reported that Apu would be written out of the show, however that report was later debunked by the producers.\n\nNumerous Simpson-related comic books have been released over the years. So far, nine comic book series have been published by Bongo Comics since 1993. The first comic strips based on \"The Simpsons\" appeared in 1991 in the magazine \"Simpsons Illustrated\", which was a companion magazine to the show. The comic strips were popular and a one-shot comic book titled \"Simpsons Comics and Stories\", containing four different stories, was released in 1993 for the fans. The book was a success and due to this, the creator of \"The Simpsons\", Matt Groening, and his companions Bill Morrison, Mike Rote, Steve Vance and Cindy Vance created the publishing company Bongo Comics. Issues of \"Simpsons Comics\", \"Bart Simpson's Treehouse of Horror\" and \"Bart Simpson\" have been collected and reprinted in trade paperbacks in the United States by HarperCollins.\n\n20th Century Fox, Gracie Films, and Film Roman produced \"The Simpsons Movie\", an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007. The film was directed by long-time \"Simpsons\" producer David Silverman and written by a team of \"Simpsons\" writers comprising Matt Groening, James L. Brooks, Al Jean, George Meyer, Mike Reiss, John Swartzwelder, Jon Vitti, David Mirkin, Mike Scully, Matt Selman, and Ian Maxtone-Graham. Production of the film occurred alongside continued writing of the series despite long-time claims by those involved in the show that a film would enter production only after the series had concluded. There had been talk of a possible feature-length \"Simpsons\" film ever since the early seasons of the series. James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode \"Kamp Krusty\" was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length. For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.\n\nOn August 10, 2018, 20th Century Fox announced that a sequel is in development.\n\nCollections of original music featured in the series have been released on the albums \"Songs in the Key of Springfield\", \"Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons\" and \"\". Several songs have been recorded with the purpose of a single or album release and have not been featured on the show. The album \"The Simpsons Sing the Blues\" was released in September 1990 and was a success, peaking at #3 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and becoming certified 2× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The first single from the album was the pop rap song \"Do the Bartman\", performed by Nancy Cartwright and released on November 20, 1990. The song was written by Michael Jackson, although he did not receive any credit. \"The Yellow Album\" was released in 1998, but received poor reception and did not chart in any country.\n\nIn 2007, it was officially announced that \"The Simpsons\" Ride, a simulator ride, would be implemented into the Universal Studios Orlando and Universal Studios Hollywood. It officially opened May 15, 2008 in Florida and May 19, 2008, in Hollywood. In the ride, patrons are introduced to a cartoon theme park called Krustyland built by Krusty the Clown. However, Sideshow Bob is loose from prison to get revenge on Krusty and the Simpson family. It features more than 24 regular characters from \"The Simpsons\" and features the voices of the regular cast members, as well as Pamela Hayden, Russi Taylor and Kelsey Grammer. Harry Shearer did not participate in the ride, so none of his characters has vocal parts.\n\nNumerous video games based on the show have been produced. Some of the early games include Konami's arcade game \"The Simpsons\" (1991) and Acclaim Entertainment's \"\" (1991). More modern games include \"\" (2001), \"\" (2003) and \"The Simpsons Game\" (2007). Electronic Arts, which produced \"The Simpsons Game\", has owned the exclusive rights to create video games based on the show since 2005. In 2010, they released a game called \"The Simpsons Arcade\" for iOS. Another EA-produced mobile game, \"\", was released in 2012 for iOS users, then in 2013 for Android and Kindle users. Two \"Simpsons\" pinball machines have been produced: one that was available briefly after the first season, and another in 2007, both out of production.\n\nThe cable television network FXX has exclusive cable and digital syndication rights for \"The Simpsons.\" Original contracts had previously stated that syndication rights for \"The Simpsons\" would not be sold to cable until the series conclusion, at a time when cable syndication deals were highly rare. The series has been syndicated to local broadcast stations in nearly all markets throughout the United States since September 1993.\n\nFXX premiered \"The Simpsons\" on their network on August 21, 2014 by starting a twelve-day marathon which featured the first 552 episodes (every single episode that had already been released at the time) aired chronologically, including \"The Simpsons Movie\", which FX Networks had already owned the rights to air. It was the longest continuous marathon in the history of television (until VH1 Classic aired a 433-hour, nineteen-day, marathon of \"Saturday Night Live\" in 2015; celebrating that program's 40th anniversary). The first day of the marathon was the highest rated broadcast day in the history of the network so far, the ratings more than tripled that those of regular prime time programming for FXX. Ratings during the first six nights of the marathon grew night after night, with the network ranking within the top 5 networks in basic cable each night.\n\nOn May 14, 2019, it was announced that FX Networks would share \"The Simpsons\" with Freeform starting October 2, 2019.\n\nOn October 21, 2014, a digital service courtesy of the FXNOW app, called \"Simpsons World\", launched. \"Simpsons World\" with every episode of the series accessible to authenticated FX subscribers, and is available on game consoles such as Xbox One, streaming devices such as Roku and Apple TV, and online via web browser. There was early criticism of both wrong aspect ratios for earlier episodes and the length of commercial breaks on the streaming service, but there are now fewer commercial breaks during individual episodes. Later it was announced that \"Simpsons World\" would now let users watch all of the SD episodes in their original format. \"Simpsons World\" was discontinued after the launch of Disney+ on November 12, 2019, where the series streams exclusively. However, the series is only available cropped to with no option to view the original versions, reigniting criticisms of cropping old episodes. In response, Disney stated \"...in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from Season 20) of \"The Simpsons\" available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.\"\n\nThe season 3 premiere \"Stark Raving Dad\", which features Michael Jackson as the voice of Leon Kompowsky, was pulled out of rotation in 2019 by Matt Groening, James L. Brooks and Al Jean after HBO aired the documentary \"Leaving Neverland\", in which two men share details into how Jackson allegedly abused them as children. It is therefore unavailable on Disney+. However, the episode is still available on \"The Complete Third Season\" DVD box set released on August 26, 2003.\n\nIn July 2017, all episodes from seasons 4 to 19 were made available for purchase on the iTunes Store, in Canada.\n\nThe popularity of \"The Simpsons\" has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. \"The Simpsons\" has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation, and The Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons \"Jeopardy!\". Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial \"Simpsons\" books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of \"Chappelle's Show\". In particular, seasons one through seventeen were released on DVD for 13 years between September 2001 to December 2014 in the U.S./Canada (Region 1), Europe (Region 2) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 19, 2015, Al Jean announced that the Season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from Seasons 1 to 17, Season 20 (released out of order in 2010), with Seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased. Jean also stated that the deleted scenes and commentaries would try to be released to the Simpsons World app, and that they were pushing for Simpsons World to be expanded outside of the U.S. Two years later, however, on July 22, 2017, it was announced that Season 18 would be released on December 5, 2017 on DVD. Another two years later, on July 20, 2019, it was announced that Season 19 would be released on December 3, 2019 on DVD.\n\nIn 2003, about 500 companies around the world were licensed to use \"Simpsons\" characters in their advertising. As a promotion for \"The Simpsons Movie\", twelve 7-Eleven stores were transformed into Kwik-E-Marts and sold \"The Simpsons\" related products. These included \"Buzz Cola\", \"Krusty-O\" cereal, pink doughnuts with sprinkles, and \"Squishees\".\n\nIn 2008, consumers around the world spent $750 million on merchandise related to \"The Simpsons\", with half of the amount originating from the United States. By 2009, 20th Century Fox had greatly increased merchandising efforts. On April 9, 2009, the United States Postal Service unveiled a series of five 44-cent stamps featuring Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie, to commemorate the show's twentieth anniversary. \"The Simpsons\" is the first television series still in production to receive this recognition. The stamps, designed by Matt Groening, were made available for purchase on May 7, 2009. Approximately one billion were printed, but only 318 million were sold, costing the Postal Service $1.2 million.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "17157886", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=17157886", "title": "Star Trek", "text": "Star Trek\n\nStar Trek is an American media franchise based on the science fiction television series created by Gene Roddenberry. The first television series, called \"Star Trek\" and now known as \"\"\", debuted on September 8, 1966 and aired for three seasons on NBC. It followed the voyages of the starship USS \"Enterprise\" on its five-year mission, the purpose of which was \"to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before!\". The USS \"Enterprise\" was a space exploration vessel built by the United Federation of Planets in the 23rd century. The \"Star Trek\" canon includes the \"Original Series\", an animated series, five spin-off television series, the film franchise, and further adaptations in several media.\n\nIn creating \"Star Trek\", Roddenberry was inspired by C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower series of novels, Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\", and television westerns such as the \"Wagon Train\". These adventures continued in the 22-episode \"\" and six feature films. Five other television series were eventually produced: \"\" follows the crew of a new starship \"Enterprise\", set a century after the original series; \"\" and \"\" are set contemporaneously with the \"Next Generation\", and \"\" is set before the original series in the early days of human interstellar travel. The most recent \"Star Trek\" television series, \"\" and \"\", air exclusively on the digital platform CBS All Access in the US. The adventures of the \"Next Generation\" crew continued in four additional feature films. In 2009, the film franchise underwent a reboot with the creation in an alternate timeline, or the \"Kelvin\" Timeline, named after a starship featured in the film \"Star Trek\". This film featured a new cast portraying younger versions of the crew from the original show; their adventures were continued in \"Star Trek Into Darkness\" (2013). Its sequel, \"Star Trek Beyond\" (2016), was released to coincide with the franchise's 50th anniversary. An additional television series is in development, \"\". Appearing on CBS All Access, it is scheduled to debut in 2020.\n\n\"Star Trek\" has been a cult phenomenon for decades. Fans of the franchise are called \"Trekkies\" or \"Trekkers\". The franchise spans a wide range of spin-offs including games, figurines, novels, toys, and comics. \"Star Trek\" had a in Las Vegas that opened in 1998 and closed in September 2008. At least two museum exhibits of props travel the world. The series has its own full-fledged constructed language, Klingon. Several parodies have been made of \"Star Trek\". In addition, viewers have produced several fan productions. As of July 2016, the franchise had generated $10 billion in revenue, making \"Star Trek\" one of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time.\n\n\"Star Trek\" is noted for its cultural influence beyond works of science fiction. The franchise is also noted for its progressive civil rights stances. \"The Original Series\" included one of television's first multiracial casts.\n\nAs early as 1964, Gene Roddenberry drafted a proposal for the science fiction series that would become \"Star Trek\". Although he publicly marketed it as a Western in outer space—a so-called \"\"Wagon Train\" to the Stars\"—he privately told friends that he was modeling it on Jonathan Swift's \"Gulliver's Travels\", intending each episode to act on two levels: as a suspenseful adventure story and as a morality tale.\n\nMost \"Star Trek\" stories depict the adventures of humans and aliens who serve in Starfleet, the space-borne humanitarian and peacekeeping armada of the United Federation of Planets. The protagonists have altruistic values, and must apply these ideals to difficult dilemmas.\n\nMany of the conflicts and political dimensions of \"Star Trek\" represent allegories of contemporary cultural realities. \"The Original Series\" addressed issues of the 1960s, just as later spin-offs have reflected issues of their respective decades. Issues depicted in the various series include war and peace, the value of personal loyalty, authoritarianism, imperialism, class warfare, economics, racism, religion, human rights, sexism, feminism, and the role of technology. Roddenberry stated: \"[By creating] a new world with new rules, I could make statements about sex, religion, Vietnam, politics, and intercontinental missiles. Indeed, we did make them on \"Star Trek\": we were sending messages and fortunately they all got by the network.\" \"If you talked about purple people on a far off planet, they (the television network) never really caught on. They were more concerned about cleavage. They actually would send a censor down to the set to measure a woman's cleavage to make sure too much of her breast wasn't showing\"\n\nRoddenberry intended the show to have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted \"Star Trek\" to show what humanity might develop into, if it would learn from the lessons of the past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave \"Star Trek\" an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network because of concerns over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that \"Enterprise\" have a racially diverse crew.\n\nThe central trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy from the \"Original Series\" was modeled on classical mythological storytelling.\n\nIn early 1964, Roddenberry presented a brief treatment for a television series to Desilu Productions, calling it \"a \"Wagon Train\" to the stars.\" Desilu worked with Roddenberry to develop the treatment into a script, which was then pitched to NBC.\n\nNBC paid to make a pilot, \"\", starring Jeffrey Hunter as \"Enterprise\" Captain Christopher Pike. NBC rejected \"The Cage\", but the executives were still impressed with the concept, and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: \"Where No Man Has Gone Before\".\n\nWhile the show initially enjoyed high ratings, the average rating of the show at the end of its first season dropped to 52nd out of 94 programs. Unhappy with the show's ratings, NBC threatened to cancel the show during its second season. The show's fan base, led by Bjo Trimble, conducted an unprecedented letter-writing campaign, petitioning the network to keep the show on the air. NBC renewed the show, but moved it from primetime to the \"Friday night death slot\", and substantially reduced its budget. In protest Roddenberry, resigned as producer and reduced his direct involvement in \"Star Trek\", which led to Fred Freiberger becoming producer for the show's third and final season. Despite another letter-writing campaign, NBC canceled the series after three seasons and 79 episodes.\n\nAfter the original series was canceled, Desilu, which by then had been renamed Paramount Television, licensed the broadcast syndication rights to help recoup the production losses. Reruns began in the fall of 1969 and by the late 1970s the series aired in over 150 domestic and 60 international markets. This helped \"Star Trek\" develop a cult following greater than its popularity during its original run.\n\nOne sign of the series' growing popularity was the first \"Star Trek\" convention which occurred on January 21–23, 1972 in New York City. Although the original estimate of attendees was only a few hundred, several thousand fans turned up. \"Star Trek\" fans continue to attend similar conventions worldwide.\n\nThe series' newfound success led to the idea of reviving the franchise. Filmation with Paramount Television produced the first post original series show, \"\". It ran on NBC for 22 half-hour episodes over two seasons on Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1974. Although short-lived, typical for animated productions in that time slot during that period, the series garnered the franchise's only \"Best Series\" Emmy Award as opposed to the franchise's later technical ones. Paramount Pictures and Roddenberry began developing a new series, \"\", in May 1975 in response to the franchise's newfound popularity. Work on the series ended, however, when the proposed Paramount Television Service folded.\n\nFollowing the success of the science fiction movies \"Star Wars and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", Paramount adapted the planned pilot episode of \"Phase II\" into the feature film \"\". The film opened in North America on December 7, 1979, with mixed reviews from critics. The film earned $139 million worldwide, below expectations but enough for Paramount to create a sequel. The studio forced Roddenberry to relinquish creative control of future sequels.\n\nThe success of the critically acclaimed sequel, \"\", reversed the fortunes of the franchise. While the sequel grossed less than the first movie, \"The Wrath of Khan\"s lower production costs made it net more profit. Paramount produced six \"Star Trek\" feature films between 1979 and 1991.\n\nIn response to the popularity of \"Star Trek\" feature films, the franchise returned to television with \"\" in 1987. Paramount chose to distribute it as a first-run syndication show rather than a network show.\n\nFollowing \"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\", Roddenberry's role was changed from producer to creative consultant with minimal input to the films while being heavily involved with the creation of \"\". Roddenberry died on October 24, 1991, giving executive producer Rick Berman control of the franchise. \"Star Trek\" had become known to those within Paramount as \"the franchise\", because of its great success and recurring role as a tent pole for the studio when other projects failed. \"The Next Generation\" had the highest ratings of any \"Star Trek\" series and became the most syndicated show during the last years of its original seven-season run. In response to the \"Next Generation\" success, Paramount released a spin-off series \"\" in 1993. While never as popular as the \"Next Generation\", the series had sufficient ratings for it to last seven seasons.\n\nIn January 1995, a few months after the \"Next Generation\" ended, Paramount released a fourth television series, \"\". \"Star Trek\" saturation reached a peak in the mid-1990s with \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"Voyager\" airing concurrently and three of the four \"Next Generation\"-based feature films released in 1994, 1996, and 1998. By 1998, \"Star Trek\" was Paramount's most important property; the enormous profits of \"the franchise\" funded much of the rest of the studio's operations. \"Voyager\" became the flagship show of the new United Paramount Network (UPN) and thus the first major network \"Star Trek\" series since the original.\n\nAfter \"Voyager\" ended, UPN produced \"\", a prequel series. \"Enterprise\" did not enjoy the high ratings of its predecessors and UPN threatened to cancel it after the series' third season. Fans launched a campaign reminiscent of the one that saved the third season of the \"Original Series\". Paramount renewed \"Enterprise\" for a fourth season, but moved it to the Friday night death slot. Like the \"Original Series\", \"Enterprise\" ratings dropped during this time slot, and UPN cancelled \"Enterprise\" at the end of its fourth season. \"Enterprise\" aired its final episode on May 13, 2005. A fan group, \"Save \"Enterprise\"\", attempted to save the series and tried to raise $30 million to privately finance a fifth season of \"Enterprise\". Though the effort garnered considerable press, the fan drive failed to save the series. The cancellation of \"Enterprise\" ended an eighteen-year continuous production run of \"Star Trek\" programming on television. The poor box office performance in 2002 of the film \"\" cast an uncertain light upon the future of the franchise. Paramount relieved Berman, the franchise producer, of control of \"Star Trek\".\n\nIn 2005, Paramount's parent company Viacom split into two companies, the CBS Corporation owner of CBS Television Studios, and Viacom owner of Paramount Pictures. CBS owned the film brand while Paramount owned the film library and would continue the film franchise. Paramount was the first company to try to revive the franchise, which it hired a new creative team to reinvigorate in 2007. Writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman and producer J. J. Abrams had the freedom to reinvent the feel of the franchise.\n\nThe team created the franchise's eleventh film, \"Star Trek\", releasing it in May 2009. The film featured a new cast portraying the crew of the original show. \"Star Trek\" was a prequel of the original series set in an alternate timeline, later named the \"Kelvin\" Timeline. This gave the film and sequels freedom from the need to conform to the franchise's canonical timeline. The eleventh \"Star Trek\" film's marketing campaign targeted non-fans, even stating in the film's advertisements that \"this is not your father's \"Star Trek\"\". It also would not interfere with CBS's franchise.\n\nThe film earned considerable critical and financial success, grossing (in inflation-adjusted dollars) more box office sales than any previous \"Star Trek\" film. The plaudits include the franchise's first Academy Award (for makeup). The film's major cast members are contracted for two sequels. Paramount's sequel to the 2009 film, \"Star Trek Into Darkness\", premiered in Sydney, Australia, on April 23, 2013, but the film did not release in the United States until May 17, 2013. While the film was not as successful in the North American box office as its predecessor, internationally, in terms of box office receipts, \"Into Darkness\" was the most successful of the franchise. The thirteenth film, \"Star Trek Beyond\", was released on July 22, 2016. The film had many pre-production problems and its script went through several rewrites. While receiving positive reviews, \"Star Trek Beyond\" disappointed in the box office.\n\nCBS turned down several proposals in the mid-2000s to restart the franchise. These included pitches from film director Bryan Singer, \"Babylon 5\" creator J. Michael Straczynski, and \"Trek\" actors Jonathan Frakes and William Shatner. The company also turned down an animated web series.\n\nDespite the franchise's absence from network television, the \"Star Trek\" film library would become highly accessible to the average viewer due to the rise of streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. To capitalize on this trend, CBS brought the franchise back to the small screen with the series \"\" to help launch and draw subscribers to its streaming service CBS All Access. The premiered on September 24, 2017 and a second season premiered in January 2019. A third \"Discovery\" season was announced on February 27, 2019. While \"Discovery\" is shown in the United States exclusively on CBS All Access, Netflix, in exchange for funding the production costs of the show, owns the international screening rights for the show.\n\nA second All Access series, \"\" features Patrick Stewart reprising the show's namesake character. \"Picard\" premiered on January 23, 2020. Unlike \"Discovery\", Amazon Prime Video will stream \"Picard\" internationally. CBS has also released two seasons of \"\", a series of standalone mini-episodes which air between \"Discovery\" and \"Picard\" seasons.\n\nAdditional All Access series are under development including the \"\" adult animated series, and a show centered around the \"Discovery\" character Philippa Georgiou. CBS's goal is to have new \"Star Trek\" content year-round on All Access.\n\nEight television series make up the bulk of the \"Star Trek\" mythos: \"Original Series\", \"Animated Series\", \"Next Generation\", \"Deep Space Nine\", \"Voyager\", \"Enterprise\", \"Discovery\", \"Short Treks\" and \"Picard\". All the series in total amount to episodes across seasons of television.\n\nStar Trek: The Original Series, frequently abbreviated as TOS, debuted on NBC on September 8, 1966. The show tells the tale of the crew of the starship and its five-year mission \"to boldly go where no man has gone before.\" During the series initial run, it was nominated for Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation multiple times, and won twice. Cast included:\n\nNBC canceled the show after three seasons; the last original episode aired on June 3, 1969. A petition near the end of the second season to save the show signed by many Caltech students and its multiple Hugo nominations would, however, indicate that despite low Nielsen ratings, it was highly popular with science fiction fans and engineering students. The series later became popular in reruns and found a cult following.\n\nStar Trek: The Animated Series, produced by Filmation, ran for two seasons from 1973 to 1974. Most of the original cast performed the voices of their characters from the \"Original Series\", and some of the writers who worked on the \"Original Series\" returned. While the animated format allowed the producers to create more exotic alien landscapes and life forms, animation errors and liberal reuse of shots and musical cues have tarnished the series' reputation. Gene Roddenberry often spoke of it as non-canon. The cast included:\n\n\"The Animated Series\" won \"Star Trek\"s first Emmy Award on May 15, 1975. The series briefly returned to television in the mid-1980s on the children's cable network Nickelodeon, and again on Sci-Fi Channel in the mid-90s. The complete series was released on LaserDisc during the 1980s. The complete series was first released in the U.S. on eleven volumes of VHS tapes in 1989. All 22 episodes were released on DVD in 2006.\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation, frequently abbreviated as TNG, takes place about a century after the \"Original Series\" (2364–2370). It features a new starship, , and a new crew:\n\nThe series premiered on , and ran for seven seasons. It had the highest ratings of any of the \"Star Trek\" series and became the highest rated syndicated show during the near the end of its run, allowing it to act as a springboard for other series. Many relationships and races introduced in the \"Next Generation\" became the basis for episodes in \"Deep Space Nine\" and \"Voyager\". The series earned several Emmy awards and nominations—including Best Dramatic Series for its final season—two Hugo Awards, and a Peabody Award for Outstanding Television Programming for one episode.\n\nStar Trek: Deep Space Nine, frequently abbreviated as DS9, takes place during the last years and immediately after the \"Next Generation\" (2369–2375). It debuted the week of , and ran for seven seasons. Unlike the other \"Star Trek\" series, \"Deep Space Nine\" was set place primarily on a space station of the same name rather than aboard a starship. The cast included:\n\nThe show begins after the brutal Cardassian occupation of the planet Bajor. The liberated Bajoran people ask the United Federation of Planets to help run a space station near Bajor. After the Federation takes control of the station, the protagonists of the show discover a uniquely stable wormhole that provides immediate access to the distant Gamma Quadrant, making Bajor and the station a strategically important location. The show chronicles the events of the station's crew, led by Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks), and Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor).\n\n\"Deep Space Nine\" stands apart from earlier \"Trek\" series for its lengthy serialized storytelling, character conflicts, and religious themes—all elements critics and audiences praised but were forbidden by Roddenberry while a producer of the original series and the \"Next Generation\".\n\nStar Trek: Voyager ran for seven seasons, airing from January 16, 1995 to May 23, 2001. It features Kate Mulgrew as Captain Kathryn Janeway, the first female commanding officer in a leading role of a \"Star Trek\" series. Cast included:\n\n\"Voyager\" takes place at about the same time period as \"Deep Space Nine\" and the years following that show's end (2371–2378). The premiere episode has the USS \"Voyager\" and its crew pursue a Maquis (Federation rebels) ship. Both ships become stranded in the Delta Quadrant about 70,000 light-years from Earth. Faced with a 75-year voyage to Earth, the crew must learn to work together to overcome challenges on their long and perilous journey home while also seeking ways to shorten the voyage.\n\nLike \"Deep Space Nine\", early seasons of \"Voyager\" feature more conflict between its crew members than seen in later episodes. Such conflict often arose from friction between \"by-the-book\" Starfleet crew and rebellious Maquis fugitives forced by circumstance to work together. The starship \"Voyager\", isolated from its home, faced new cultures and dilemmas not possible in shows based in the Alpha Quadrant. Later seasons brought in an influx of characters and cultures from prior shows, such as the Borg, Q, the Ferengi, Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians and cast members of the \"Next Generation\".\n\nStar Trek: Enterprise, originally titled Enterprise, is a prequel to the original \"Star Trek\" series. It aired from to on UPN. \"Enterprise\" is set during 2150s, ninety years after Zefram Cochrane's first warp flight, and approximately ten years before the creation of the Coalition of Planets which became the United Federation of Planets. The show follows the crew of Earth's first Warp-5 capable starship, . Cast included:\n\nInitially, \"Enterprise\" featured self-contained episodes, much like the \"Original Series\", \"Next Generation\" and \"Voyager\". The comprised a single narrative arc. The fourth, and final, season consisted of several three and four-episode arcs, which explored the origins of some elements of previous series, and resolved some continuity errors with \"The Original Series\".\n\nRatings for \"Enterprise\" started strong but declined rapidly. Although critics received the fourth season well, both fans and the cast reviled the series finale, partly because of the episode's focus on the guest appearance of members of the \"Next Generation\" cast. The cancellation of \"Enterprise\" ended an 18-year run of new \"Star Trek\" series, which began with the \"Next Next Generation\" in 1987.\n\nStar Trek: Discovery is a direct prequel to the \"\", set roughly ten years prior. It premiered in the United States and Canada on CBS. The series is CBS All Access exclusive in the United States. Netflix distributes the series worldwide, except for Canada.\n\nThe series primary protagonist is Lt. Commander Michael Burnham, portrayed by Martin-Green. This is a departure from previous \"Star Trek\" series whose lead character is traditionally the \"captain of the ship\". The series opened with a conflict with the Klingon T'Kuvma, attempting to unite the twenty-four Klingon factions—called the Great Houses, and the United Federation of Planets.\n\nStar Trek: Short Treks is a short film anthology companion series initially exploring settings and characters from \"Discovery\". More recent episodes feature the crew of the \"Enterprise\" under the command of Christopher Pike.\n\nStar Trek: Picard is the ninth series in the \"Star Trek\" franchise and centers on the character Jean-Luc Picard. Set at the end of the 24th century, 18 years after the events of \"\" (2002).\n\nCBS All Access has two upcoming series announced to be in development, one live action and one animated. Michelle Yeoh will reprise her role as the mirror universe's Philippa Georgiou of Section 31 from \"Discovery\" in a still untitled series.\n\nTwo seasons have been ordered for , an animated adult comedy series created by the \"Rick and Morty\" writer Mike McMahan. The series will follow the support crew of \"one of Starfleet's least important ships.\" Nickelodeon has commissioned an animated children's series, to be produced as a joint-venture with CBS.\n\nParamount Pictures has produced thirteen \"Star Trek\" feature films, the most recent being released in July 2016. The first six films continue the adventures of the cast of the \"Original Series\"; the seventh film, \"Generations\" was intended as a transition from original cast to the cast of the \"Next Generation\"; the next three films, focused completely on the \"Next Generation\" cast.\n\nThe eleventh film and its sequels occur in an alternate timeline with a new cast portraying the \"Original Series\" characters. Leonard Nimoy portrayed an elderly Spock in the films, providing a narrative link to what became known as the Prime Timeline. The alternate reality was christened the \"Kelvin\" Timeline by Michael and Denise Okuda, in honor of the starship USS \"Kelvin\" which was first seen in the 2009 film.\n\nAn R-rated \"Star Trek\" film, to be directed by Quentin Tarantino, was announced as in-development in December 2017. In a December 2019 interview with \"Consequence of Sound\", Tarantino indicated he may not direct the film. He later confirmed he would not direct any future \"Star Trek\" film in a January 2020 interview with \"Deadline\", effectively ending development. In November 2019, a new, unrelated film was announced as in-development, to be directed by Noah Hawley.\n\n\"Star Trek\" has an on-going tradition of actors returning to reprise their roles in other spin-off series. In some instances, actors have portrayed potential ancestors, descendants, or relatives of characters they originated. Characters have also been recast for later appearances.\n\nBelow is an incomplete list:\n\nMany licensed products are based on the \"Star Trek\" franchise. Merchandising is very lucrative for both studio and actors; by 1986 Nimoy had earned more than $500,000 from royalties. Products include novels, comic books, video games, and other materials, which are generally considered non-canon. \"Star Trek\" merchandise generated $4 billion for Paramount by 2002.\n\nSince 1967, hundreds of original novels, short stories, and television and movie adaptations have been published. The first original \"Star Trek\" novel was \"Mission to Horatius\" by Mack Reynolds, which was published in hardcover by Whitman Books in 1968.\n\nThe first publisher of \"Star Trek\" fiction aimed at adult readers was Bantam Books. James Blish wrote adaptations of episodes of the original series in twelve volumes from 1967 to 1977; in 1970, he wrote the first original Star Trek novel published by Bantam, \"Spock Must Die!\".\n\nPocket Books published subsequent \"Star Trek\" novels. Prolific \"Star Trek\" novelists include Peter David, Diane Carey, Keith DeCandido, J.M. Dillard, Diane Duane, Michael Jan Friedman, and Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens. Several actors from the television series have also written or co-written books featuring their respective characters: William Shatner, John de Lancie, Andrew J. Robinson, J. G. Hertzler and Armin Shimerman. \"Voyager\" producer Jeri Taylor wrote two novels detailing the personal histories of \"Voyager\" characters. Screenplay writers David Gerrold, D. C. Fontana, and Melinda Snodgrass have also penned books.\n\nA 2014 scholarly work Newton Lee discussed the actualization of \"Star Trek's\" holodeck in the future by making extensive use of artificial intelligence and cyborgs.\n\n\"Star Trek\"-based comics have been almost continuously published since 1967. They have been offered by several companies, including Marvel, DC, Malibu, Wildstorm, and Gold Key. Tokyopop is publishing an anthology of \"Next Generation\"-based stories presented in the style of Japanese manga. , IDW Publishing secured publishing rights to \"Star Trek\" comics and published a prequel to the 2009 film, \"\". In 2012, IDW published the first volume of \"Star Trek – The Newspaper Strip\" featuring the work of Thomas Warkentin.\n\nThe \"Star Trek\" franchise has numerous games in many formats. Beginning in 1967 with a board game based on the original series and continuing through today with online and DVD games, \"Star Trek\" games continue to be popular among fans.\n\nVideo games of the series include \"\" and \"\". An MMORPG based on \"Star Trek\" called \"Star Trek Online\" was developed by Cryptic Studios and published by Perfect World. It is set during the \"Next Generation\" era, about 30 years after the events of \"\". The most recent video game was set in the alternate timeline from Abrams's \"Star Trek\".\n\nOn June 8, 2010, WizKids announced the development of a \"Star Trek\" collectible miniatures game using the HeroClix game system.\n\n\"Star Trek\" has led directly or indirectly to the creation of a number of magazines which focus either on science fiction or specifically on \"Star Trek\". \"Starlog\" was a magazine which was founded in the 1970s. Initially, its focus was on \"Star Trek\" actors, but then it began to expand its scope. \"\" was a magazine published in the U.S. which ceased publication in 2003. \"Star Trek Magazine\", originally published as Star Trek Monthly by Titan Magazines for the United Kingdom market, began in February 1995. The magazine has since expanded to worldwide distribution.\n\nOther magazines through the years included professional, as well well as magazines published by fans, or fanzines.\n\nThe \"Star Trek\" media franchise is a multibillion-dollar industry, owned by CBS. Gene Roddenberry sold \"Star Trek\" to NBC as a classic adventure drama; he pitched the show as \"\"Wagon Train\" to the Stars\" and as \"Horatio Hornblower in Space\". The opening line, \"to boldly go where no man has gone before,\" was taken almost verbatim from a U.S. White House booklet on space produced after the Sputnik flight in 1957. The central trio of Kirk, Spock, and McCoy was modeled on classical mythological storytelling.\n\n\"Star Trek\" and its spin-offs have proven highly popular in syndication and was broadcast worldwide. The show's cultural impact goes far beyond its longevity and profitability. \"Star Trek\" conventions have become popular among its fans, who call themselves \"trekkie or \"trekkers\". An entire subculture has grown up around the franchise, which was documented in the film \"Trekkies\". \"Star Trek\" was ranked most popular cult show by \"TV Guide\". The franchise has also garnered many comparisons of the \"Star Wars\" franchise being rivals in the science fiction genre with many fans and scholars.\n\nThe \"Star Trek\" franchise inspired some designers of technologies, the Palm PDA and the handheld mobile phone. Michael Jones, Chief technologist of Google Earth, has cited the tricorder's mapping capability as one inspiration in the development of Keyhole/Google Earth. The Tricorder X Prize, a contest to build a medical tricorder device was announced in 2012. Ten finalists were selected in 2014, and the winner was to be selected in January 2016. However, no team managed to reach the required criteria. \"Star Trek\" also brought teleportation to popular attention with its depiction of \"matter-energy transport\", with the famously misquoted phrase \"Beam me up, Scotty\" entering the vernacular. The \"Star Trek\" replicator is credited in the scientific literature with inspiring the field of diatom nanotechnology. In 1976, following a letter-writing campaign, NASA named its prototype space shuttle \"Enterprise\", after the fictional starship. Later, the introductory sequence to \"Star Trek: Enterprise\" included footage of this shuttle which, along with images of a naval sailing vessel called \"Enterprise\", depicted the advancement of human transportation technology. Additionally, some contend that the \"Star Trek\" society resembles communism.\n\nBeyond \"Star Trek\"s fictional innovations, its contributions to television history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While more common in subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode \"Plato's Stepchildren\", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. Nichelle Nichols, who played the communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry of her plan to leave the series, she was told a big fan wanted to meet her while attending a NAACP dinner party:\n\nEarly parodies of \"Star Trek\" included a famous sketch on \"Saturday Night Live\" titled \"The Last Voyage of the Starship \"Enterprise\"\", with John Belushi as Kirk, Chevy Chase as Spock and Dan Aykroyd as McCoy. In the 1980s, \"Saturday Night Live\" did a sketch with William Shatner reprising his Captain Kirk role in \"The Restaurant Enterprise\", preceded by a sketch in which he played himself at a \"Trek\" convention angrily telling fans to \"Get a Life\", a phrase that has become part of \"Trek\" folklore. \"In Living Color\" continued the tradition in a sketch where Captain Kirk is played by a fellow Canadian Jim Carrey.\n\nA feature-length film that indirectly parodies \"Star Trek\" is \"Galaxy Quest\". This film is based on the premise that aliens monitoring the broadcast of an Earth-based television series called \"Galaxy Quest\", modeled heavily on \"Star Trek\", believe that what they are seeing is real. Many \"Star Trek\" actors have been quoted saying that \"Galaxy Quest\" was a brilliant parody.\n\n\"Star Trek\" has been blended with Gilbert and Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players presented a \"Star Trek\" adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan titled \"H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation\" in 1991 and an adaptation by Jon Mullich of Gilbert and Sullivan's \"H.M.S. Pinafore\" that sets the operetta in the world of \"Star Trek\" has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold. A similar blend of Gilbert and Sullivan and \"Star Trek\" was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was titled \"Star Drek: The Generation After That\". It presented an original story with Gilbert and Sullivan melodies.\n\n\"The Simpsons\" and \"Futurama\" television series and others have had many individual episodes parodying \"Star Trek\" or with \"Trek\" allusions. \"Black Mirror's\" \"Star Trek\" parody episode, \"USS Callister\", won four Emmy Awards, including the Outstanding Television Movie and Writing for a Limited Series, Movie or Drama, and was nominated for three more.\n\nIn August 2010, the members of the Internal Revenue Service created a \"Star Trek\" themed training video for a conference. Revealed to the public in 2013, the spoof along with parodies of other media franchises was cited as an example of the misuse of taxpayer funds in a congressional investigation.\n\n\"Star Trek\" has been parodied in several non-English movies, including the German \"Traumschiff Surprise – Periode 1\" which features a gay version of the \"Original Series\" bridge crew and a Turkish film that spoofs that same series' episode \"The Man Trap\" in one of the series of films based on the character Turist Ömer. An entire series of films and novel parodies titled \"Star Wreck\" has been created in Finnish.\n\n\"The Orville\" is a comedy-drama science fiction television series created by Seth MacFarlane that premiered on September 10, 2017, on Fox. MacFarlane, a longtime fan of the franchise who previously guest-starred on an episode of \"Enterprise\", created the series with a similar look and feel as the \"Star Trek\" series. MacFarlane has made references to \"Star Trek\" on his animated series \"Family Guy\", where the \"Next Generation\" cast guest-starred in the episode \"Not All Dogs Go to Heaven\".\n\nUntil 2016, Paramount Pictures and CBS permitted fan-produced films and episode-like clips to be produced. Several veteran \"Star Trek\" actors and writers participated in many of these productions. Several producers turned to crowdfunding, such as Kickstarter, to help with production and other costs.\n\nPopular productions include: (2004–2016) and \"Star Trek Continues\" (2013–2017). Additional productions include: (2008), originally released as a three-part web series, and \"Prelude to Axanar\". Audio dramatizations such as \"The Continuing Mission\" (2007–2016) have also been published by fans.\n\nIn 2016, CBS published guidelines which restricted the scope of fan productions, such as limiting the length of episodes or films to fifteen minutes, limiting production budgets to $50,000, and preventing actors and technicians from previous \"Star Trek\" productions from participating. A number of highly publicized productions have since been cancelled or have gone abeyant.\n\n\"Star Trek\" inspired the popularity of slash fiction, a genre of fan-produced, in-universe fiction where normally platonic, same-sex characters are portrayed as being a romantic couple. The most notable being Kirk/Spock stories.\n\nOver the intervening decades, especially with the advent of the Internet, fan fiction has become its own thriving fandom.\n\nOf the various science fiction awards for drama, only the Hugo Award dates back as far as the original series. In 1968, all five nominees for a Hugo Award were individual episodes of \"Star Trek\", as were three of the five nominees in 1967. The only \"Star Trek\" series not to receive a Hugo Award nomination are the \"Animated Series\" and \"Voyager\", though the \"Original Series\" and \"Next Generation\" never won in any nominated category. No \"Star Trek\" feature film has ever won a Hugo Award. In 2008, the fan-made \"\" episode \"World Enough and Time\" was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Short Drama.\n\n\"Star Trek\" (2009) won the Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling, the franchise's first Academy Award. In 2016, the franchise was listed in the Guinness World Records as the most successful science fiction television franchise in the world.\n\nIn 1996, \"TV Guide\" published the following as the ten best \"Star Trek\" episodes for the franchise's 30th anniversary:\n\nAt the 50th Anniversary Star Trek Las Vegas (STLV) convention, in 2016, the following were voted by fans as the best episodes:\n\nAdditionally, fans voted the following as the worst episodes:\n\n\"Star Trek\" was originally a joint-production of Norway Productions, owned by Roddenberry, and Desilu. The profit-sharing agreement for the series split proceeds between Norway, Desilu—later Paramount Television, William Shatner, and NBC. However, \"Star Trek\" lost money during its initial broadcast, and NBC did not expect to recoup its losses by selling the series into syndication, nor did Paramount.\n\nWith NBC's approval, Paramount offered its share of the series to Roddenberry sometime in 1970. However, Roddenberry could not raise the $150,000 () offered by the studio. Paramount would go on to license the series for the syndication market worldwide. NBC's remaining broadcast and distribution rights eventually returned to Paramount sometime before 1986, which coincided with the development of what would become \"\".\n\nIn 1967, Desilu was acquired by Gulf+Western. The studio was reorganized as the television production division of Paramount Pictures, which Gulf+Western had acquired in 1966. Gulf+Western sold its remaining industrial assets in 1989, renaming itself Paramount Communications.\n\nSometime before 1986, Sumner Redstone acquired a controlling stake of Viacom via his family's theater chain, National Amusements. Viacom was originally established in 1952 as a division of CBS responsible for syndicating the network's programming, then called CBS Films. In 1994, Viacom and Paramount Communications merged. Viacom then merged with its former parent, CBS Corporation, in 1999.\n\nIn 2005, the Redstone family reorganized Viacom, spinning off the conglomerate's assets as two independent groups: the new Viacom, and the new CBS Corporation. National Amusements and the Redstone family retained approximately 80% ownership of both CBS and Viacom. \"Star Trek\" was split between the two entities.\n\nThe terms of the franchise split between CBS and Viacom were not known. However, CBS held all copyrights, marks, production assets, and film negatives, to all \"Star Trek\" television series. CBS also retained the rights to all likenesses, characters, names and settings, and stories, and the right to license \"Star Trek\", and its spin-offs, to merchandisers, and publishers, etc. The rights were exercised via the CBS Television Studios, which was carved out of the former Paramount Television\n\nViacom, which housed Paramount Pictures, retained the feature film library, and exclusive rights to produce new feature films for a limited time. Viacom also retained home video distribution rights for all television series produced before 2005. However, home video editions of the various television series released after 2005, as well as streaming video versions of episodes available worldwide, carried variants of the new CBS Television Studios livery, in addition to the original Paramount Television Studios livery. It was unclear if CBS retained some, if not all, synchronization or streaming rights.\n\nRights issues and the fraught relationship between the leadership at CBS, Viacom, and National Amusements resulted in a number of delayed and or cancelled \"Star Trek\" productions. Additionally, the development and production of \"Star Trek\" (2009) was met with resistance by executives at CBS, as was \"Into Darkness\" (2013) and \"Beyond\" (2016), which affected merchandising and promotions for the new films.\n\nThe competitive nature of the entertainment industry led to negotiations between Viacom and CBS on a potential merger, with CBS as the acquiring party, which would realign the stakeholders of the franchise under one corporate umbrella. After several failed attempts at a merger, negotiations restarted between CBS and Viacom in 2019, led by Shari Redstone, chairman of National Amusements, and Joe Ianniello, then CEO of Viacom. On , CBS and Viacom boards of directors reached an agreement to reunite the conglomerates as a single entity called ViacomCBS. National Amusements board of directors approved the merger on . The merger was finalized on .\n\n\n"}
{"id": "871053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=871053", "title": "Tom and Jerry", "text": "Tom and Jerry\n\nTom and Jerry is an American animated series of comedy short films created in 1940 by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. Best known for its 161 theatrical short films by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the series centers on a love-hate relationship between the title characters Tom, a cat, and Jerry, a mouse. Many shorts also feature several recurring characters.\n\nIn its original run, Hanna and Barbera produced 114 \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts for MGM from 1940 to 1958. During this time, they won seven Academy Awards for Animated Short Film, tying for first place with Walt Disney's \"Silly Symphonies\" with the most awards in the category. After the MGM cartoon studio closed in 1957, MGM revived the series with Gene Deitch directing an additional 13 \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts for Rembrandt Films from 1961 to 1962. \"Tom and Jerry\" then became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, overtaking \"Looney Tunes\". Chuck Jones then produced another 34 shorts with Sib Tower 12 Productions between 1963 and 1967. Three more shorts were produced, \"The Mansion Cat\" in 2001, \"The Karate Guard\" in 2005, and \"A Fundraising Adventure\" in 2014, making a total of 164 shorts.\n\nA number of spin-offs have been made, including the television series \"The Tom and Jerry Show\" (1975), \"The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show\" (1980–82), \"Tom & Jerry Kids\" (1990–93), \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" (2006–08), and \"The Tom and Jerry Show\" (2014–present). The first feature-length film based on the series, \"\", was released in 1992, and 13 direct-to-video films have been produced since 2002, with an upcoming live-action film to be released in 2020. A musical adaptation of the series, titled \"Tom and Jerry: Purr-Chance to Dream\", debuted in Japan in 2019 in advance of \"Tom and Jerry\"s upcoming 80th anniversary.\n\nThe series features comic fights between an iconic pair of adversaries, a house cat (Tom) and a mouse (Jerry). The plots of each short usually center on Tom's numerous attempts to capture Jerry and the mayhem and destruction that follows. Tom rarely succeeds in catching Jerry, mainly because of Jerry's cleverness, cunning abilities, and luck. However, on several occasions, they have displayed genuine friendship and concern for each other's well-being. At other times, the pair set aside their rivalry in order to pursue a common goal, such as when a baby escapes the watch of a negligent babysitter, causing Tom and Jerry to pursue the baby and keep it away from danger, in the shorts Busy Buddies and Tot Watchers respectively. Despite their endless attacks on one another, they have saved each other's lives every time they were truly in danger.\n\nThe cartoons are known for some of the most violent cartoon gags ever devised in theatrical animation: Tom may use axes, hammers, firearms, firecrackers, explosives, traps and poison to kill Jerry. On the other hand, Jerry's methods of retaliation are far more violent, with frequent success, including slicing Tom in half, decapitating him, shutting his head or fingers in a window or a door, stuffing Tom's tail in a waffle iron or a mangle, kicking him into a refrigerator, getting him electrocuted, pounding him with a mace, club or mallet, letting a tree or electric pole drive him into the ground, sticking matches into his feet and lighting them, tying him to a firework and setting it off, and so on. Because of this, \"Tom and Jerry\" has often been criticized as excessively violent. However, there is no blood or gore in any scene.\n\nMusic plays a very important part in the shorts, emphasizing the action, filling in for traditional sound effects, and lending emotion to the scenes. Musical director Scott Bradley created complex scores that combined elements of jazz, classical, and pop music; Bradley often reprised contemporary pop songs, as well as songs from MGM films, including \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Meet Me in St. Louis\", which both starred Judy Garland in a leading role.\n\nGenerally, there is little dialogue as Tom and Jerry almost never speak; however, minor characters are not similarly limited, and the two lead characters do speak English on rare occasions. For example, the character Mammy Two Shoes has lines in nearly every cartoon in which she appears. Most of the vocal effects used for Tom and Jerry are their high-pitched laughs and gasping screams.\n\nTom (named \"Jasper\" in his debut appearance) is a grey and white mute domestic shorthair cat. (\"Tom\" is a generic name for a male cat.) He is usually but not always, portrayed as living a comfortable, or even pampered life, while Jerry (named \"Jinx\" in his debut appearance) is a small, brown mute, house mouse who always lives in close proximity to Tom. Despite being very energetic, determined and much larger, Tom is no match for Jerry's wits. Jerry also possesses surprising strength for his size, approximately the equivalent of Tom's, lifting items such as anvils with relative ease and withstanding considerable impacts. Although cats typically chase mice to eat them, it is quite rare for Tom to actually try to eat Jerry. Most of his attempts are just to torment or humiliate Jerry, sometimes in revenge, and sometimes to obtain a reward from a human for catching Jerry. By the final \"fade-out\" of each cartoon, Jerry usually emerges triumphant, while Tom is shown as the loser.\n\nHowever, other results may be reached. On rare occasions, Tom triumphs, usually when Jerry becomes the aggressor or he pushes Tom a little too far. In \"The Million Dollar Cat\" Jerry learns that Tom will lose his newly acquired wealth if he harms any animal, especially mice; he then torments Tom a little too much until he retaliates. In \"Timid Tabby\" Tom's look-alike cousin pushes Jerry over the edge. Occasionally and usually ironically, they both lose, usually because Jerry's last trap or attack on Tom backfires on him or he overlooks something. In Chuck Jones' \"Filet Meow\", Jerry orders a shark from the pet store to scare Tom away from eating a goldfish. Afterward, the shark scares Jerry away as well. Finally, they occasionally end up being friends, although, within this set of stories, there is often a last-minute event that ruins the truce. One cartoon that has a friendly ending is \"Snowbody Loves Me\".\n\nBoth characters display sadistic tendencies, in that they are equally likely to take pleasure in tormenting each other, although it is often in response to a triggering event. However, when one character appears to truly be in mortal danger from an unplanned situation or due to actions by a third party, the other will develop a conscience and save him. Occasionally, they bond over a mutual sentiment towards an unpleasant experience and their attacking each other is more play than serious attacks. Multiple shorts show the two getting along with minimal difficulty, and they are more than capable of working together when the situation calls for it, usually against a third party who manages to torture and humiliate them both. Sometimes this partnership is forgotten quickly when an unexpected event happens, or when one character feels that the other is no longer necessary. This is the case in Posse Cat, when they agree that Jerry will allow himself to be caught if Tom agrees to share his reward dinner, but Tom then reneges. Other times, however, Tom does keep his promise to Jerry and the partnerships are not quickly dissolved after the problem is solved.\n\nTom changes his love interest many times. The first love interest is Toots who appears in \"Puss n' Toots\", and calls him \"Tommy\" in \"The Mouse Comes to Dinner\". He is also interested in a cat called Toots in \"The Zoot Cat\" although she has a different appearance to the original Toots. The most frequent love interest of Tom's is Toodles Galore, who never has any dialogue in the cartoons.\n\nDespite five shorts ending with a depiction of Tom's apparent death, his demise is never permanent; he even reads about his own death in a flashback in \"Jerry's Diary\". He appears to die in explosions in \"Mouse Trouble\" (after which he is seen in heaven), \"Yankee Doodle Mouse\" and in \"Safety Second\", while in \"The Two Mouseketeers\" he is guillotined offscreen. The short \"Blue Cat Blues\" ends with both Tom and Jerry sitting on the railroad tracks with the intent of suicide while the whistle of an oncoming train is heard foreshadowing their imminent death.\n\nAlthough many supporting and minor characters speak, Tom and Jerry rarely do so themselves. One exception is \"The Lonesome Mouse\" where they speak several times briefly, primarily Jerry, to contrive to get Tom back into the house. Tom more often sings while wooing female cats; for example, Tom sings Louis Jordan's \"Is You Is or Is You Ain't My Baby\" in the 1946 short \"Solid Serenade\". In that short and \"Zoot Cat\", Tom woos female cats using a deep, heavily French-accented voice in imitation of then-popular leading man, actor Charles Boyer. At the end of \"The Million Dollar Cat\", after beginning to antagonize Jerry he says, \"Gee, I'm throwin' away a million dollars... BUT I'M HAPPY!\" In \"\", Jerry says, \"No, no, no, no, no,\" when choosing the shop to remove his ring. In \"The Mouse Comes to Dinner\", Tom speaks to his girlfriend Toots while inadvertently sitting on a stove: \"Say, what's cookin'?\", to which Toots replies \"You are, stupid.\" Another instance of speech comes in \"Solid Serenade\" and \"The Framed Cat\", where Tom directs Spike through a few dog tricks in a dog-trainer manner.\n\nCo-director William Hanna provided most of the squeaks, gasps, and other vocal effects for the pair, including the most famous sound effects from the series, Tom's leather-lunged scream (created by recording Hanna's scream and eliminating the beginning and ending of the recording, leaving only the strongest part of the scream on the soundtrack) and Jerry's nervous gulp.\n\nThe only other reasonably common vocalization is made by Tom when some external reference claims a certain scenario or eventuality to be impossible, which inevitably, ironically happens to thwart Tom's plans – at which point, a bedraggled and battered Tom appears and says in a haunting, echoing voice \"Don't you believe it!\", a reference to the then-popular 1940s radio show \"Don't You Believe It.\" In \"Mouse Trouble\", Tom says \"Don't you believe it!\" after being beaten up by Jerry, which also happens in \"The Missing Mouse\". In the 1946 short \"Trap Happy\", Tom hires a cat disguised as a mouse exterminator who, after several failed attempts to dispatch Jerry and suffering a lot of accidents in the process, changes profession to \"Cat\" exterminator by crossing out the \"Mouse\" on his title and writing \"CAT\", resulting in Tom spelling out the word out loud before reluctantly pointing at himself. One short, 1956's \"Blue Cat Blues\", is narrated by Jerry in voiceover (voiced by Paul Frees) as they try to win back their ladyfriends. Jerry was voiced by Sara Berner during his appearance in the 1945 MGM musical \"Anchors Aweigh\". \"\" is the first (and so far only) installment of the series where the famous cat-and-mouse duo regularly speaks. In that movie, Tom was voiced by Richard Kind, and Jerry was voiced by Dana Hill.\n\nIn his attempts to catch Jerry, Tom often has to deal with Spike (known as \"Killer\" and \"Butch\" in some shorts), an angry, vicious but easily duped bulldog who tries to attack Tom for bothering him or his son Tyke while trying to get Jerry. Originally, Spike was unnamed and mute (aside from howls and biting noises) as well as attacking indiscriminately, not caring whether it was Tom or Jerry though usually attacking Tom. In later cartoons, Spike spoke often, using a voice and expressions (performed by Billy Bletcher and later Daws Butler) modeled after comedian Jimmy Durante. Spike's coat has altered throughout the years between grey and creamy tan. The addition of Spike's son Tyke in the late 1940s led to both a slight softening of Spike's character and a short-lived spin-off theatrical series (\"Spike and Tyke\").\n\nMost cartoons with Spike in them conform to a theme: usually, Spike is trying to accomplish something (such as building a dog house or sleeping) when Tom and Jerry's antics stop him doing it. Spike then (presumably due to prejudice) singles out Tom as the culprit, and threatens him that if it ever happens again, he will do \"something horrible\" to him (effectively forcing Tom to take the blame) while Jerry overhears; afterward, Jerry usually does anything he can to interrupt whatever Spike is doing while Tom barely manages to stop him (usually getting injured in the process). Usually, Jerry does eventually wreck whatever Spike is doing in spectacular fashion and leaves Tom to take the blame, forcing him to flee from Spike and inevitably lose (usually because Tom is usually framed by Jerry and that Spike just doesn't like Tom). Off-screen, Spike does something to Tom and finally, Tom is generally shown injured or in a bad situation while Jerry smugly cuddles up to Spike unscathed. Tom sometimes gets irritated with Spike (an example is in \"That's My Pup!\", when Spike forces Tom to run up a tree every time his son barked, causing Tom to hang Tyke on a flag pole). At least once, however, Tom does something that benefits Spike, who promises not to interfere ever again; causing Jerry to frantically leave the house and run into the distance (in Hic-cup Pup). Spike is well known for his famous \"\"Listen pussycat!\" catchphrase when he threatens Tom, his other famous catchphrase is \"That's my boy!\"\" normally said when he supports or congratulates his son.\n\nTyke is described as a cute, sweet-looking, happy and lovable puppy. He is Spike's son; but unlike Spike, Tyke does not speak and only communicates (mostly towards his father) by barking, yapping, wagging his tail, whimpering and growling. Spike would always go out of his way to care and comfort his son and make sure that he is safe from Tom. Tyke loves his father and Spike loves his son and they get along like friends, although most of time they would be taking a nap or Spike would teach Tyke the main facts of life of being a dog. Like Spike, Tyke's appearance has altered throughout the years, from grey (with white paws) to creamy tan. When Tom and Jerry Kids first aired, this was the first time that viewers could hear Tyke speak.\n\nButch is a black, cigar-smoking alley cat who also wants to eat Jerry. He is Tom's most frequent adversary. However, for most of the shorts he appears in, he is usually seen rivaling Tom over Toodles. Butch was also Tom's chum as in some cartoons, where Butch is leader of Tom's alley cat buddies, who are mostly Lightning, Topsy, and Meathead. Butch talks more often than Tom or Jerry in most shorts.\n\nButch and Toodles were originally introduced in Hugh Harman's 1941 short \"The Alley Cat\", but were integrated into \"Tom and Jerry\" rather than continuing in their own series.\n\nNibbles is a small grey mouse who often appears in shorts as Jerry's nephew. He is a carefree individual who very rarely understands the danger of the situation, simply following instructions the best he can both to Jerry's command and his own innocent understanding of the situation. This can lead to such results as \"getting the cheese\" by simply asking Tom to pick it up for him, rather than following Jerry's example of outmaneuvering and sneaking around Tom. Many times Nibbles is an ally of Jerry in fights against Tom, including being the second Mouseketeer. He is given speaking roles in all his appearances as a Mouseketeer, often with a high-pitched French tone. However, during a short in which he rescued Robin Hood, his voice was instead more masculine, gruff, and cockney accented.\n\nMammy Two Shoes is a heavy-set middle-aged woman who often has to deal with the mayhem generated by the lead characters. Voiced by character actress Lillian Randolph, she is often seen as the owner of Tom. Her face was only shown once, very briefly, in \"Saturday Evening Puss\". Mammy's appearances have often been edited out, dubbed, or re-animated as a slim white woman in later television showings, since her character is a mammy archetype now often regarded as racist. She was mostly restored in the DVD releases of the cartoons, with an introduction by Whoopi Goldberg explaining the importance of African-American representation in the cartoon series, however stereotyped.\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" was a commonplace phrase for youngsters indulging in riotous behaviour in 19th-century London. The term comes from \"Life in London, or Days and Nights of Jerry Hawthorne and his elegant friend Corinthian Tom\" (1823) by Pierce Egan. However Brewer notes no more than an \"unconscious\" echo of the Regency era original in the naming of the cartoon.\n\nIn June 1937, animator and storyman Joseph Barbera began to work for the Ising animation unit at MGM, then the largest studio in Hollywood. He learned that co-owner Louis B. Mayer wished to boost the animation department by encouraging the artists to develop some new cartoon characters, following the lack of success with its earlier cartoon series based on the \"Captain and the Kids\" comic strip. Barbera then teamed with fellow Ising unit animator and director William Hanna and pitched new ideas, among them was the concept of two \"equal characters who were always in conflict with each other\". An early thought involved a fox and a dog before they settled on a cat and mouse. The pair discussed their ideas with producer Fred Quimby, then the head of the short film department who, despite a lack of interest in it, gave them the green-light to produce one cartoon short.\n\nThe first short, \"Puss Gets the Boot\", features a cat named Jasper and an unnamed mouse, named Jinx in pre-production, and an African American housemaid named Mammy Two Shoes. Leonard Maltin described it as \"very new and special [...] that was to change the course of MGM cartoon production\" and established the successful \"Tom and Jerry\" formula of comical cat and mouse chases with slapstick gags. It was released onto the theatre circuit on February 10, 1940 and the pair, having been advised by management not to produce any more, focused on other cartoons including \"Gallopin' Gals\" (1940) and \"Officer Pooch\" (1941). Matters changed, however, when Texas businesswoman Bessa Short sent a letter to MGM asking whether more cat and mouse shorts would be produced, which helped convince management to commission a series. A studio contest held to rename both characters was won by animator John Carr, who suggested Tom the cat and Jerry the mouse after the Christmastime drink. Carr was awarded a first place prize of $50. \"Puss Gets the Boot\" was a critical success, earning an Academy Award nomination for Best Short Subject: Cartoons in 1941 despite the credits listing Ising and omitting Hanna and Barbera.\n\nAfter MGM gave the green-light for Hanna and Barbera to continue, the studio entered production on the second \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon, \"The Midnight Snack\" (1941). The pair would continue to work on the series for the next fifteen years of their career. Early into the series, Jerry never started the conflict, and shorts typically involved Tom losing by the end. The composer of the series, Scott Bradley, made it difficult for the musicians to perform his score which often involved the twelve-tone technique developed by Arnold Schoenberg. The series developed a quicker, more energetic and violent tone which was inspired by the work of MGM colleague Tex Avery. Hanna and Barbera made minor adjustments to Tom and Jerry's appearance so they would \"age gracefully\". Jerry went on to lose weight and his long eyelashes, while Tom lost his jagged fur for a smoother appearance, had larger eyebrows, and received a white and grey face with a white mouth. He adopted a quadrupedal stance at first, like a real cat, to become increasingly and almost exclusively bipedal.\n\nHanna and Barbera produced 114 cartoons for MGM, thirteen of which were nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Subject and seven went on to win, breaking the winning streak held by Walt Disney's studio in the category. \"Tom and Jerry\" won more Academy Awards than any other character-based theatrical animated series. Barbera estimated the typical budget of $50,000 for each \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon which made the duo take \"time to get it right\". A typical cartoon took around six weeks to make. He and Hanna did not work with a script beforehand, instead worked on the story as they drew scenes. Quimby was credited as the producer of all cartoons until 1955.\n\nThe rise in television in the 1950s caused problems for the MGM animation studio, leading to budget cuts on \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons due to decreased revenue from theatrical screenings. In an attempt to combat this, MGM ordered that all subsequent shorts be produced in the widescreen CinemaScope format; the first, \"Touché, Pussy Cat!\", was released in December 1954. However, the studio found that re-releases of older cartoons were earning as much as new ones, resulting in the executive decision to cease production on \"Tom and Jerry\" and later the animation studio on May 15, 1957. The final cartoon produced by Hanna and Barbera, \"Tot Watchers\", was released on August 1, 1958. The pair were fired and focused on own production company Hanna-Barbera Productions, which went on to produce such popular animated television series including \"The Flintstones\", \"Yogi Bear\", \"The Jetsons\" and \"Scooby-Doo\".\nBefore 1954, all \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were produced in the standard Academy ratio and format; in 1954 and 1955, some of the output was dually produced in dual versions: one Academy-ratio negative composed for a flat widescreen (1.75:1) format and one shot in the CinemaScope process. From 1955 until the close of the MGM cartoon studio a year later, all \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were produced in CinemaScope, some even had their soundtracks recorded in Perspecta directional audio. All of the Hanna and Barbera cartoons were shot as successive color exposure negatives in Technicolor.\n\nIn 1961, MGM revived the \"Tom and Jerry\" franchise, and contracted European animation studio Rembrandt Films to produce 13 \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts in Prague, Czechoslovakia. All were directed by Gene Deitch and produced by William L. Snyder. Deitch himself wrote most of the cartoons, with occasional assistance from Larz Bourne and Eli Bauer. Stěpan Koniček provided the musical score for the Deitch shorts. Sound effects were produced by electronic music composer Tod Dockstader and Deitch. The majority of vocal effects and voices in Deitch's films were provided by Allen Swift and Deitch.\n\nDeitch states that, being a \"UPA man\", he was not a fan of the \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, thinking they were \"needlessly violent\". However, after being assigned to work on the series, he quickly realized that \"nobody took [the violence] seriously\", and it was merely \"a parody of exaggerated human emotions\". He also came to see what he perceived as the \"biblical roots\" in Tom and Jerry's conflict, similar to David and Goliath, stating \"That's where we feel a connection to these cartoons: the little guy can win (or at least survive) to fight another day.\"\n\nSince the Deitch/Snyder team had seen only a handful of the original \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts, and since the team produced their cartoons on a tighter budget of $10,000, the resulting films were considered surrealist in nature, though this was not Deitch's intention. The animation was limited and jerky in movement, compared to the more fluid Hanna-Barbera shorts. Background art was done in a more simplistic, angular, Art Deco-esque style. The soundtracks featured sparse and echoic electronic music, futuristic sound effects, heavy reverb, and dialogue that was mumbled rather than spoken. According to Jen Nessel of \"The New York Times\", \"The Czech style had nothing in common with these gag-driven cartoons.\"\n\nWhereas Hanna-Barbera's shorts generally took place in and outside of a house, Deitch's shorts opted for more exotic locations, such as a 19th-century whaling ship, the jungles of Nairobi, an Ancient Greek acropolis, or the Wild West. In addition, Mammy Two-Shoes was replaced as Tom's owner by a bald, overweight, short-tempered, middle-aged white man, who bore a striking resemblance to Clint Clobber. Just like Spike the Bulldog, he is also much more brutal and violent in punishing Tom's actions as compared to previous owners, often beating and thrashing Tom repeatedly.\n\nTo avoid being linked to Communism, Deitch romanized the Czech names of his crew in the opening credits of the shorts (e.g. Stêpan Koniček became \"Steven Konichek\" and Vaclav Lidl became \"Victor Little\"). In addition, these shorts are among the few \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons not to carry the \"Made In Hollywood, U.S.A.\" phrase on the end title card; due to Deitch's studio being behind the Iron Curtain, the production studio's location is omitted entirely on it. After the 13 shorts were completed, Joe Vogel, the head of production, was fired from MGM. Vogel had approved of Deitch and his team's work, but MGM decided not to renew their contract after Vogel's departure. The final of the 13 shorts, \"Carmen Get It!\", was released on December 21, 1962.\n\nDeitch's shorts were commercial successes. In 1961, the \"Tom and Jerry\" series became the highest-grossing animated short film series of that time, dethroning \"Looney Tunes\", which had held the position for 16 years; this success was repeated once more in 1962. However, unlike the Hanna-Barbera shorts, none of Deitch's films were nominated for nor did they win an Academy Award. In retrospect, these shorts are often considered the worst of the \"Tom and Jerry\" theatrical output. Deitch stated that due to his team's inexperience as well as their low budget, he \"hardly had a chance to succeed\", and \"well understand[s] the negative reactions\" to his shorts. He believes \"They could all have been better animated – truer to the characters – but our T&Js were produced in the early 1960s, near the beginning of my presence here, over a half-century ago as I write this!\" Despite the criticism, some fans wrote positive letters to Deitch, stating that his \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts were their personal favorites due to their quirky and surreal nature. The shorts were released on DVD in 2015 in .\nThe 1960s entries were done in Metrocolor but returned to the standard Academy ratio and format.\n\nAfter the last of the Deitch cartoons were released, Chuck Jones, who had been fired from his 30-plus year tenure at Warner Bros. Cartoons, started his own animation studio, Sib Tower 12 Productions (later renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts), with partner Les Goldman. Beginning in 1963, Jones and Goldman went on to produce , all of which carried Jones' distinctive style (and a slight psychedelic influence).\n\nJones had trouble adapting his style to \"Tom and Jerry\"'s brand of humor, and a number of the cartoons favored full animation, personality and style over storyline. The characters underwent a slight change of appearance: Tom was given thicker eyebrows (resembling Jones' Grinch, Count Blood Count or Wile E. Coyote), a less complex look (including the color of his fur becoming gray), sharper ears, longer tail and furrier cheeks (resembling Jones' Claude Cat or Sylvester), while Jerry was given larger eyes and ears, a lighter brown color, and a sweeter, Porky Pig-like expression.\n\nSome of Jones' \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons are reminiscent of his work with Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner, included the uses of blackout gags and gags involving characters falling from high places. Jones co-directed the majority of the shorts with layout artist Maurice Noble. The remaining shorts were directed by Abe Levitow and Ben Washam, with Tom Ray directing two shorts built around footage from earlier \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons directed by Hanna and Barbera, and Jim Pabian directed a short with Maurice Noble. Various vocal characteristics were made by Mel Blanc, June Foray and even Jones himself. These shorts contain a memorable opening theme, in which Tom first replaces the MGM lion, then is trapped inside the \"O\" of his name.\n\nThough Jones's shorts were generally considered an improvement over Deitch's, they nevertheless had varying degrees of critical success. MGM ceased production of \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts in 1967, by which time Jones had moved on to television specials and the feature film \"The Phantom Tollbooth\". The shorts were released on DVD in 2009 in .\n\nBeginning in 1965, the Hanna and Barbera \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons began to appear on television in heavily edited versions. The Jones team was required to take the cartoons featuring Mammy Two Shoes and remove her by pasting over the scenes featuring her with new scenes. Most of the time, she was replaced with a similarly fat white Irish woman; occasionally, as in \"Saturday Evening Puss\", a thin white teenager took her place instead, with both characters voiced by June Foray. However, recent telecasts on Cartoon Network and Boomerang retain Mammy with new voiceover work performed by Thea Vidale to remove the stereotypical black jargon featured on the original cartoon soundtracks. The standard \"Tom and Jerry\" opening titles were removed as well. Instead of the roaring MGM Lion sequence, an opening sequence featuring different clips of the cartoons was used instead. The title cards were also changed. A pink title card with the name written in white font was used instead.\n\nDebuting on CBS' Saturday morning schedule on September 25, 1965, \"Tom and Jerry\" moved to CBS Sundays two years later and remained there until September 17, 1972.\n\nIn 1975, Tom and Jerry were reunited with Hanna and Barbera, who produced new \"Tom and Jerry cartoons\" for Saturday mornings. These 48 seven-minute short cartoons were paired with \"Grape Ape\" and \"Mumbly\" cartoons, to create \"The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape Show\", \"The Tom and Jerry/Grape Ape/Mumbly Show\", and \"The Tom and Jerry/Mumbly Show\", all of which initially ran on ABC Saturday mornings between September 6, 1975, and September 3, 1977. In these cartoons, Tom and Jerry (now with a red bow tie), who had been enemies during their formative years, became nonviolent pals who went on adventures together, as Hanna-Barbera had to meet the stringent rules against violence for children's TV. This 1975-styled format was no longer used in the newer Tom and Jerry entrees.\n\nFilmation Studios (in association with MGM Television) also tried their hands at producing a \"Tom and Jerry\" TV series. Their version, \"The Tom and Jerry Comedy Show\", debuted in 1980, and also featured new cartoons starring Droopy, Spike (from Tom & Jerry, and the same version also used in Droopy), Slick Wolf, and Barney Bear, not seen since the original MGM shorts. The Filmation \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were noticeably different from Hanna-Barbera's efforts, as they returned \"Tom and Jerry\" to the original chase formula, with a somewhat more \"slapstick\" humor format. This incarnation, much like the 1975 version, was not as well-received by audiences as the originals, and lasted on CBS Saturday mornings from September 6, 1980, to September 4, 1982.\n\nIn 1986, MGM was purchased by WTBS founder Ted Turner. Turner sold the company a short while later, but retained MGM's pre-1986 film library, thus \"Tom and Jerry\" became the property of Turner Entertainment Co. (where the rights stand today via Warner Bros.), and have in subsequent years appeared on Turner-run stations, such as TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, The WB, Boomerang, and Turner Classic Movies.\n\nOne of the biggest trends for Saturday morning television in the 1980s and 1990s was the child versions of famous classic cartoon stars \"babyfication\" of older, classic cartoon stars, and on March 2, 1990, \"Tom and Jerry Kids\", co-produced by Turner Entertainment Co. and Hanna-Barbera Productions (which would be sold to Turner in 1991) debuted on Fox Kids and for a few years, aired on British children's block, CBBC. It featured a youthful version of the famous cat-and-mouse duo chasing each other. As with the 1975 H-B series, Jerry wears his red bowtie, while Tom now wears a red cap. Spike and his son Tyke (who now had talking dialogue) and Droopy and his son Dripple, appeared in back-up segments for the show, which ran until November 18, 1994. \"Tom and Jerry Kids\" was the last Tom and Jerry cartoon series produced in 4:3 (full screen) aspect ratio.\n\nIn 2001, a new television special titled \"Tom and Jerry: The Mansion Cat\" premiered on Boomerang. It featured Joe Barbera (who was also a creative consultant) as the voice of Tom's owner, whose face is never seen. In this cartoon, Jerry, housed in a habitrail, is as much of a house pet as Tom is, and their owner has to remind Tom to not \"blame everything on the mouse\".\n\nIn 2005, a new Tom and Jerry theatrical short, titled \"The Karate Guard\", which had been written and directed by Barbera and Spike Brandt, storyboarded by Joseph Barbera and Iwao Takamoto and produced by Joseph Barbera, Spike Brandt, and Tony Cervone premiered in Los Angeles cinemas on September 27, 2005. As part of the celebration of \"Tom and Jerry\"s sixty-fifth anniversary, this marked Barbera's first return as a writer, director and storyboard artist on the series since his and Hanna's original MGM cartoon shorts, and last overall; he would die shortly after production ended. Director/animator, Spike Brandt was nominated for an Annie award for best character animation. The short debuted on Cartoon Network on January 27, 2006.\nThe 2005 short \"The Karate Guard\" was filmed in the standard Academy ratio and format.\n\nDuring the first half of 2006, a new series called \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" was produced at Warner Bros. Animation. Thirteen half-hour episodes (each consisting of three shorts, some of them—like \"The Karate Guard\"—were produced and completed in 2003 as part of a 30-plus theatrical cartoon schedule aborted after the financial disaster of \"\") were produced, with only markets outside of the United States and United Kingdom signed up. The show then came to the UK in February 2006 on Boomerang, and it went to the U.S. on Kids' WB on The CW. \"Tales\" is the first \"Tom and Jerry\" TV series that utilizes the original style of the classic shorts, along with the slapstick. The series was canceled in 2008, shortly before the Kids' WB block shut down. \"Tales\" is also the first \"Tom and Jerry\" production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (which was aired on Cartoon Network in the United States) but cropped to 4:3 fullscreen aspect ratio (which was aired on The CW and Boomerang in the United States).\n\nCartoon Network, which began rerunning the \"Tom and Jerry Tales\" in January 2012, subsequently aired a second series consisting of two 11-minute shorts per episode that likewise sought to maintain the look, core characters and sensibility of the original theatrical shorts. Similar to other reboot works like \"Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated\" and \"The Looney Tunes Show\", several episodes the new series brought Tom and Jerry into contemporary environments, telling new stories and relocating the characters to more fantastic worlds, from a medieval castle to a mad scientist's lab. Titled \"The Tom and Jerry Show\", the series is produced by Warner Bros. Animation, with Sam Register serving as executive producer in collaboration with Darrell Van Citters and Ashley Postelwaite at Renegade Animation. Originally slated for an undated 2013 Cartoon Network premiere before being pushed back to April 9, 2014, this is the second \"Tom and Jerry\" production presented in 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio.\n\nIn November 2014, a two-minute sketch was shown as part of the Children In Need Telethon in the United Kingdom, the sketch was produced as a collaboration with Warner Bros.\n\nWhen shown on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom (from April 1967 to February 2001, usually on the BBC) \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons were not edited for violence, and Mammy was retained. As well as having regular slots (mainly after the evening BBC News with around two shorts shown every evening and occasionally shown on children's network CBBC in the morning), \"Tom and Jerry\" served the BBC in another way. When faced with disruption to the schedules (for example when live broadcasts overran), the BBC would invariably turn to \"Tom and Jerry\" to fill any gaps, confident that it would retain much of an audience that might otherwise channel hop. This proved particularly helpful in 1993, when \"Noel's House Party\" had to be cancelled due to an IRA bomb scare at BBC Television Centre; \"Tom and Jerry\" was shown instead, bridging the gap until the next programme. In 2006, a mother complained to OFCOM about the smoking shown in the cartoons, since Tom often attempts to impress love interests with the habit, resulting in reports that the smoking scenes in \"Tom and Jerry\" films may be subject to censorship.\n\nDue to its very limited use of dialogue, \"Tom and Jerry\" was easily translated into various foreign languages. \"Tom and Jerry\" began broadcast in Japan in 1965. A 2005 nationwide survey taken in Japan by TV Asahi, sampling age groups from teenagers to adults in their sixties, ranked \"Tom and Jerry\" #85 in a list of the top 100 \"anime\" of all time; while their web poll taken after the airing of the list ranked it at #58 – the only non-Japanese animation on the list, and beating anime classics like \"\", \"A Little Princess Sara\", and the ultra-classics \"Macross\" and \"Ghost in the Shell\". (In Japan, the word \"anime\" refers to \"all\" animation regardless of origin, not just Japanese animation.) \"Tom and Jerry\" also serve as long-time licensed mascots for Gifu-based Juroku Bank.\nUnlike some other Western cartoons such as \"Bob the Builder\" and \"Postman Pat\", whose characters had to be doctored to have five fingers in each hand instead of the original four, \"Tom and Jerry\" aired in Japan without such edits, as did other series starring non-human protagonists such as \"SpongeBob SquarePants\".\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" have long since been popular in Germany. The different shorts are usually linked together with key scenes from \"Jerry's Diary\" (1949), in which Tom reads about his and Jerry's past adventures. The cartoons are introduced with rhyming German language verse, and when necessary, a German voice spoke the translations of English labels on items and similar information.\n\nThe show was aired in mainland China by CCTV in the mid-1980s to early 1990s and was extremely popular at the time. Collections of the show are still a prominent feature in Chinese book stores.\n\nIn the Philippines, the series was aired on ABS-CBN from 1966 until its closure due to the country's declaration of martial law in 1972, with the later Hanna-Barbera shorts from Barbecue Brawl to Tot Watchers and all of Gene Deitch and Chuck Jones shorts. RPN aired most of Hanna-Barbera shorts from 1977 until 1989. ABS-CBN would later return to the air after the restoration of democracy in 1986 and air the same shorts as in the pre-martial law era. This lasted until the end of 1988.\n\nIn Indonesia, the series was aired on TPI (later re-branded as MNCTV) from the mid-1990s to early 2010s and RCTI during 2000s.\n\nEven though Gene Deitch's shorts were created in Czechoslovakia (1960–1962), the first official TV release of \"Tom and Jerry\" was in 1988. It was one of the few cartoons of western origin broadcast in Czechoslovakia (1988) and Romania (until 1989) before the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989.\n\nThe Pakistani ice cream brand OMORÉ has launched a chocolate bar ice cream based on the show.\n\nTom and Jerry's first feature film appearance was in the 1945 MGM musical \"Anchors Aweigh\", in which Jerry performs a dance number with Gene Kelly. In this scene, Tom also made a cameo as a servant. Filmmakers had wanted Mickey Mouse for the scene, but Roy Disney had rejected the deal, as the Disney studio was focusing on its own cartoons to help pay off its debts after World War II. William Hanna and Joe Barbera supervised animation for the scene.\n\nTom and Jerry's second feature film appearance was swimming with Esther Williams in a dream sequence in another MGM musical, \"Dangerous When Wet\" (1953).\n\nOn October 1, 1992, the first international release of \"\" arrived when the film was released overseas to theaters in Europe and then domestically by Miramax Films on July 30, 1993, with future video and DVD releases that would be sold under Warner Bros., which, following Disney's acquisition of Miramax and Turner's subsequent merger with Time Warner, had acquired the film's distribution rights. Barbera served as creative consultant for the picture, which was produced and directed by Phil Roman. The film was a musical with a structure similar to MGM's blockbusters, \"The Wizard of Oz\" and \"Singin' in the Rain\". In 2001, Warner Bros. (which had, by then, merged with Turner and assumed its properties) released the duo's first direct-to-video movie, \"\", in which Tom covets a ring that grants mystical powers to the wearer, and has become accidentally stuck on Jerry's head. It would mark the last time Hanna and Barbera co-produced a \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon together, as William Hanna died shortly after \"The Magic Ring\" was released.\n\nFour years later, Bill Kopp scripted and directed two more \"Tom and Jerry\" DTV features for the studio, \"\" and \"\", the latter one based on a story by Barbera. Both were released on DVD in 2005, marking the celebration of Tom and Jerry's 65th anniversary. In 2006, another direct-to-video film, \"\", tells the story about the pair having to work together to find the treasure. Joe came up with the storyline for the next film, \"\", as well as the initial idea of synchronizing the on-screen actions to music from Tchaikovsky's \"Nutcracker Suite\". This DTV film, directed by Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone, would be Joe Barbera's last \"Tom and Jerry\" project due to his death in December 2006. The holiday-set animated film was released on DVD in late 2007 and dedicated to Barbera. A new direct-to-video film, \"Tom and Jerry Meet Sherlock Holmes\", was released on August 24, 2010. It is the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie produced without any of the characters' original creators. The next direct-to-video film, \"Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz\", was released on August 23, 2011 and was the first made-for-video Tom and Jerry movie made for Blu-ray. It had a preview showing on Cartoon Network. \"\" was released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 2, 2012. \"Tom and Jerry's Giant Adventure\" was released in 2013 on Blu-ray and DVD. \"\" was released on DVD on September 2, 2014. \"\" was released on DVD on June 23, 2015. \"\" was released on DVD on June 21, 2016. \"\" was released on DVD on July 11, 2017.\n\nOn April 6, 2015, a new theatrical feature film was announced. It was originally going to be completely animated and were \"in the same vein\" as the source material. Cate Adams and Jesse Ehrman were oversee the movie. However, in October 2018, it was announced that it will instead be a live action/2D animated hybrid film. The film will be directed by Tim Story and will begin filming at Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden later in 2019. In April 2019, Chloë Grace Moretz joined the cast as Kayla, a girl who works at a hotel that gets occupied by Jerry, forcing her to bring in Tom to get rid of him. In May 2019, Michael Peña joined the cast as Terrance, Kayla's mean boss and the antagonist of the film. In July 2019, Colin Jost joined the cast. The film was set to be released on April 16, 2021. The film has now been rescheduled to be released on December 23, 2020.\n\nLike many animated cartoons from the 1930s to the 1950s, \"Tom and Jerry\" featured racial stereotypes.\nAfter explosions, for example, characters with blasted faces would resemble stereotypical blacks, with large lips and bow-tied hair. Perhaps the most controversial element of the show is the character Mammy Two Shoes, a poor black maid who speaks in a stereotypical \"black accent\" and has a rodent problem. Joseph Barbera, who was responsible for these gags, claimed that the racial gags in \"Tom and Jerry\" did not reflect his racial opinion; they were just reflecting what was common in society and cartoons at the time and were meant to be humorous. Today, the blackface gags are often censored when these shots are aired. Mammy Two-Shoes' voice was re-dubbed by Turner in the mid-1990s to make the character sound less stereotypical; the resulting accent sounds more Irish. Three shorts in particular, \"His Mouse Friday\", the depiction of cannibals, in \"Casanova Cat\", a scene where the face of Jerry is blackened by Tom with cigar smoke and \"Mouse Cleaning\" where Tom is shown as blackface has been removed from the Blu-ray DVD edition.\n\nIn Tom and Jerry's \"Spotlight Collection\" DVD, a disclaimer by Whoopi Goldberg warns viewers about the potentially offensive material in the cartoons and emphasizes that they were \"wrong then and they are wrong today\", borrowing a phrase from the Warner Bros. Golden collection. This disclaimer is also used in the \"Tom and Jerry Golden Collection: Volume 1\" on iTunes.\n\nAs of 2011, most shorts that feature Mammy Two Shoes, except \"Part Time Pal\", are rarely seen on Cartoon Network and Boomerang. There are other shorts (\"The Lonesome Mouse\", \"Blue Cat Blues\", and \"The Mouse from H.U.N.G.E.R.\") that are found inappropriate for the intended audiences rather than just having racist contents and are censored from the two channels as well.\n\nIn 2006, the British version of the Boomerang channel made plans to edit \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons being aired in the UK where the characters were seen to be smoking. There was a subsequent investigation by UK media watchdog Ofcom. It has also taken the U.S. approach by censoring blackface gags, though this seems to be random as not all scenes of this type are cut. One Gene Deitch-era short, \"Buddies Thicker Than Water\", is shortened as one scene involves drunkeness during their friendship.\n\nIn 2013, it was reported that Cartoon Network of Brazil censored 27 shorts on the grounds of being \"politically incorrect\". In an official release, the channel confirmed that it had censored only two shorts (\"The Two Mouseketeers\" and \"Heavenly Puss\") \"by editorial issues and appropriateness of the content to the target audience—children of 7 to 11 years\".\n\n\"Tom and Jerry\" began appearing in comic books in 1942, as one of the features in Dell Comics' \"Our Gang Comics\". In 1949, with MGM's live-action \"Our Gang\" shorts having ceased production five years earlier, the series was renamed \"Tom and Jerry Comics\". That title ran 212 issues with Dell before being handed off to Western Publishing, where it ran until issue #344 in 1984. Tom and Jerry continued to appear in various comic books for the rest of the 20th century. Tom and Jerry comics were also extremely popular in Norway, Germany, Sweden, the U.K., the Netherlands, and Australia.\n\nA \"Tom and Jerry\" comic strip was syndicated from 1950 to 1952. Although credited to MGM animation studio head Fred Quimby, experts believe the strips were ghosted by Gene Hazleton and possibly Ernie Stanzoni and Dan Gormley. Tom and Jerry was revived as a comic strip from 1989 to 1994, syndicated to the South American market by Editors Press Service. The strip was produced by Kelley Jarvis during this era, with the exception of a short period in 1990–1991 when it was done by Paul Kupperberg & Rich Maurizio.\n\nThe pair have appeared in a number of video games as well, spanning titles for systems for the Sega Genesis plus also Sega Game Gear and the Sega Master System and their rival console around the 1990s, Nintendo Entertainment System and Super NES and Nintendo 64 to more recent entries for PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube and also on the portable Nintendo consoles, Game Boy and Nintendo DS.\n\nA musical, or , adaptation of the cartoon series, titled \"Tom and Jerry: Purr-Chance to Dream\", debuted in Japan in 2019 in advance of the series' upcoming 80th anniversary. The musical was composed by Masataka Matsutoya, staged by Seiji Nozoe, and written by Shigeki Motoiki.\n\nThroughout the years, the term and title \"Tom and Jerry\" became practically synonymous with never-ending rivalry, as much as the related \"cat and mouse fight\" metaphor has. Yet in \"Tom and Jerry\" it was not the more powerful Tom who usually came out on top.\n\nIn January 2009, IGN named Tom and Jerry as the 66th best in the Top 100 Animated TV Shows.\n\nIn 1973, the magazine \"National Lampoon\" referenced \"Tom and Jerry\" in a violence-filled comic book parody, \"Kit 'n' Kaboodle\".\n\nIn \"The Simpsons\", \"The Itchy & Scratchy Show\" is a spoof of \"Tom and Jerry\"—a \"cartoon within a cartoon\". In an episode of the series titled \"Krusty Gets Kancelled\", \"Worker and Parasite\", a replacement cartoon for \"Itchy & Scratchy\", is a reference to Soviet-era animation.\n\nIn an interview found on the DVD releases, several \"MADtv\" cast members stated that Tom and Jerry is one of their biggest influences for slapstick comedy. Also in the Cartoon Network show \"MAD\", Tom and Jerry appear in three segments \"Celebrity Birthdays\", \"Mickey Mouse Exterminator Service\", and \"Tom and Jury\". Johnny Knoxville from \"Jackass\" has stated that watching \"Tom and Jerry\" inspired many of the stunts in the movies.\n\nIn the pre-video era, \"Tom & Jerry\" cartoons were a popular subject for 8mm home movies, with the UK-based Walton Films issuing dozens of titles as colour one-reel Super 8 films, in both silent and sound editions. Walton's agreement with MGM obligated them to release the films in slightly edited form, even though the single-reel format would have comfortably accommodated the cartoons' seven to eight minute running time.\n\nMGM/UA released a series of \"Tom & Jerry\" laserdisc box sets in the 1990s. \"The Art of Tom & Jerry\" volumes 1 and 2, contain all the MGM shorts up to (but not including) the Deitch Era, including letterboxed versions of the shorts filmed in CinemaScope. The cartoons are all intact save for \"His Mouse Friday\" (dialogue has been wiped) and \"Saturday Evening Puss\", which is the re-drawn version with June Foray's voice added. A third volume to \"The Art of Tom & Jerry\" was released and contains all of the Chuck Jones-era \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts.\n\nThere have been several \"Tom and Jerry\" DVDs released in Region 1 (the United States and Canada), including a series of two-disc sets known as the \"Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection\". There have been negative responses to Vol. 1 and Vol. 2, due to some of the cartoons included on each having cuts and redubbed Mammy Two-Shoes dialogue. A replacement program offering uncut versions of the shorts on DVD was later announced. There are also negative responses to Vol. 3, due to \"Mouse Cleaning\" and \"Casanova Cat\" being excluded from these sets and \"His Mouse Friday\" being edited for content with an extreme zooming-in towards the end to avoid showing a particularly race-based caricature.\n\nThere have been two \"Tom and Jerry\" DVD sets in Region 2. In Western Europe, most of the \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts have been released (only two, \"The Million Dollar Cat\" and \"Busy Buddies\", were not included) under the name \"\". Almost all of the shorts contain re-dubbed Mammy Two-Shoes tracks. Despite these cuts, \"His Mouse Friday\", the only \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoon to be completely taken off the airwaves in some countries due to claims of racism, is included, unedited with the exception of zooming-in as on the North American set. These are regular TV prints sent from the U.S. in the 1990s. Shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in pan and scan. \"Mouse Cleaning\" and \"Casanova Cat\" are presented uncut as part of these sets.\n\n\"\" is available in six double-sided DVDs (issued in the United Kingdom) and 12 single-layer DVDs (issued throughout Western Europe). Another \"Tom and Jerry\" Region 2 DVD set is available in Japan. As with \"Tom and Jerry: The Classic Collection\" in Western Europe, almost all of the shorts (including \"His Mouse Friday\") contain cuts. \"Slicked-up Pup\", \"Tom's Photo Finish\", \"Busy Buddies\", \"The Egg and Jerry\", \"Tops with Pops\" and \"Feedin' the Kiddie\" are excluded from these sets. However, most of these cartoons are included in the UK version. Most shorts produced in CinemaScope are presented in pan and scan for showing on the 4:3 aspect ratio television screen.\n\nPrior to 2015, the Gene Deitch-era shorts saw limited home media release outside of Europe and Asia. In Japan, all thirteen shorts were released on the \"Tom and Jerry & Droopy\" laserdisc and VHS, as well as on the bonus DVD for those who have purchased all the ten titles of the DVD collection series at its initial release. In the United Kingdom, the shorts are available on the second side of the \"Tom and Jerry: The Classic Collection: Volume 5\" DVD. In the United States, \"The Tom and Jerry Cartoon Kit\", \"Down and Outing\", and \"Carmen Get It!\" were included on the \"Paws for a Holiday\" VHS and DVD, the \"Summer Holidays\" DVD, and the \"Musical Mayhem\" DVD, respectively. On June 2, 2015, \"\" DVD was released in the United States, with all thirteen shorts as well as special features.\n\nThe Chuck Jones-era \"Tom and Jerry\" shorts were released in a two-disc set titled \"\" on June 23, 2009. On October 25, 2011, Warner Home Video released the first volume of the \"Tom and Jerry Golden Collection\" on DVD and Blu-ray. This set featured newly remastered prints and bonus material never before seen. The sets were aimed at the collector in a way that the previous \"Spotlight\" DVD releases were not. A second set was due for release at June 11, 2013. In February 2013, it was announced by TVShowsOnDVD.com that \"Mouse Cleaning\" was not part of the list of cartoons on this release, as well as the cartoon \"Casanova Cat\" that was also skipped over on the 2007 DVD release. Many collectors and fans have posted negative reviews of the product on Amazon and other various websites to make Warner put \"Mouse Cleaning\" and \"Casanova Cat\" on the release.\n\nThe following cartoons won the Oscar for Best Short Subject: Cartoons:\n\nThese cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Short Subject: Cartoons, but did not win:\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki> Theatrical release\n\n\nReferences\n\n"}
{"id": "99961", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=99961", "title": "The Tonight Show", "text": "The Tonight Show\n\nThe Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the NBC Studios in Rockefeller Center in New York City, the show's original location (a tradition interrupted by decades of emanating from various studios in the Los Angeles region), and airing on NBC since 1954. The series has been hosted by six comedians: Steve Allen, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Jay Leno, on two occasions, Conan O'Brien, and Jimmy Fallon, and the series has had several recurring guest hosts including Ernie Kovacs during the Steve Allen era and Joan Rivers, Garry Shandling, and Jay Leno during Johnny Carson's stewardship (along with dozens of occasional substitutes), although the practice has been abandoned since Carson's departure, with hosts preferring reruns to showcasing potential rivals. \"The Tonight Show\" is the world's longest-running talk show and the longest-running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \"Today\" and \"Meet the Press\".\n\nOver the course of more than 60 years, \"The Tonight Show\" has undergone only minor title changes. It aired under the name \"Tonight\" for several of its early years, as well as \"Tonight Starring Jack Paar\" and \"The Jack Paar Show\" due to the runaway popularity of its host, eventually settling permanently on \"The Tonight Show\" after Carson began his tenure in 1962, albeit with the host's name always included in the title. Beginning with Carson's debut episode, network programmers, advertisers, and the show's announcers would refer to the show by including the name of the host; for example, it is currently announced as \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\". In 1957, the show briefly tried a more news-style format. It has otherwise adhered to the talk show format introduced by Allen and honed further by Paar.\n\nCarson is the longest-serving host to date, although he is not the host with the most episodes. \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" aired for 30 seasons between October 1962 and May 1992. Leno, however, has the record of having hosted the greatest number of total televised episodes. Leno's record accounts for the fact that unlike Carson (who only produced new shows three days a week starting in the 1980s), Leno never used guest hosts on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" (except Katie Couric, once) and produced new shows five days a week; Leno himself was also Carson's primary guest host for the last five years of Carson's tenure, giving him even more episodes to his credit. Leaving out Leno's five years as permanent guest host, Leno hosted 119 more episodes as full-time host than Carson. During Carson's first four years, the show ran for 105 minutes and then was reduced to ninety minutes in early 1967 when Carson stopped appearing for the first 15 minutes because most affiliates were carrying their local news during that time slot as they expanded to half an hour. During Carson's 1980 contract negotiations, the show was shortened to sixty minutes beginning that September, where it has remained since. NBC also broadcast \"The Best of Carson\" which were repeats of some of Carson's popular older albeit usually recent shows. Prior to the debut of \"Saturday Night Live\" in October 1975, NBC aired \"The Best of Carson\" on Saturday nights at 11:30 pm.\n\nOutside of its brief run as a news show in 1957, Conan O'Brien is the shortest-serving host. O'Brien hosted 146 episodes over the course of less than eight months before Leno was brought back as host, where he served for almost four additional years. Current host Fallon took the helm on February 17, 2014. Fallon had previously hosted \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\", and before \"Late Night\" he was a popular member of the cast of \"Saturday Night Live\", co-hosting the \"Weekend Update\" with Tina Fey as well as performing sketches.\n\nFrom 1950 to 1951 NBC aired \"Broadway Open House\", a nightly variety show hosted primarily by comic Jerry Lester. It was initially not a success (hosting five nights a week quickly burned through all of Lester's material faster than he could create it, and he was given rotating hosting duties for a weekly prime time variety show in 1951); the network scaled back late-night programming to shorter weekly shows. A spin-off, \"Dagmar's Canteen\", aired the following season on Saturday nights; at some other point in the week, \"Mary Kay's Nightcap\" (which mostly consisted of previews of the next day's programming) also aired that season.\n\nThe format of \"The Tonight Show\" can be traced to a nightly 40-minute local program in New York, hosted by Allen and originally titled \"The Knickerbocker Beer Show\" (after the sponsor). It was quickly retitled \"The Steve Allen Show\". This premiered in 1953 on WNBT-TV, (now broadcasting as WNBC-TV), the local station affiliate in New York City. Beginning in September 1954, it was renamed \"Tonight!\" and began its historic run on the full NBC network.\nNotes for hosting history\n\nThe first \"Tonight\" announcer was Gene Rayburn. Allen's version of the show originated talk show staples such as an opening monologue, celebrity interviews, audience participation, and comedy bits in which cameras were taken outside the studio, as well as music including guest performers and a house band under Lyle \"Skitch\" Henderson.\n\nWhen the show became a success, Allen got a primetime Sunday comedy/variety show in June 1956, leading him to share \"Tonight\" hosting duties with Ernie Kovacs during the 1956–57 season. To give Allen time to work on his Sunday evening show, Kovacs hosted \"Tonight\" on Monday and Tuesday nights with his own announcer (Bill Wendell) and bandleader.\n\nDuring the later Steve Allen years, regular audience member Lillian Miller (usually referred to as \"Miss Miller\") became such an integral part that she was forced to join American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the television/radio performers union. She would continue to perform the same service for most of the major talk shows for decades, including those hosted by Paar, Carson, Merv Griffin (until 1986), and Mike Douglas, among others.\n\nAllen and Kovacs departed \"Tonight\" in January 1957 after NBC ordered Allen to concentrate all his efforts on his Sunday-night variety program, hoping to combat dominance of the Sunday night ratings first by CBS's \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" then by ABC's \"Maverick\". \n\nUnlike the first installment of Johnny Carson's tenure, which is lost except for audio recordings, a kinescope recording of most of the very first \"Tonight Show\" under Allen survives. In this recording, Allen states during his opening monologue that \"this show is going to go on forever\"; although in context (and as part of a series of jokes) Allen refers to the fact the program is scheduled to run late into the night, his statement has come to refer to the longevity of the franchise.\n\nRather than continuing with the same format after Allen and Kovacs’s departure from \"Tonight\", NBC changed the show's format to a news and features show, similar to that of the network's popular morning program \"Today\". The new show, renamed \"Tonight! America After Dark\", was hosted first by Jack Lescoulie (also an announcer and long-time cast member on the \"Today\" morning program, 1952–1967) and then by Al (\"Jazzbo\") Collins, with interviews conducted by Hy Gardner, and music provided by the Lou Stein Trio (later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, then the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet). This new version of the show was unpopular, resulting in a significant number of NBC affiliates dropping the show.\n\nIn July 1957, NBC returned the program to a talk/variety show format once again, with Jack Paar (who left his role as morning show host on CBS to join NBC) becoming the new solo host of the show. Under Paar, most of the NBC affiliates that had dropped the show during the ill-fated run of \"Tonight! America After Dark\" began airing the show once again. Paar's era began the practice of branding the series after the host, and as such the program, though officially still called \"Tonight\", was also marketed as \"The Jack Paar Show\". A combo band conducted by Paar's Army buddy pianist Jose Melis filled commercial breaks and backed musical entertainers. Paar also introduced the idea of having guest hosts; one of these early hosts coincidentally was Johnny Carson. It was also one of the first regularly scheduled network shows to be telecast in color beginning sporadically in September 1957, with regular color broadcasts beginning in September 1960.\n\nOn February 11, 1960, Jack Paar walked off his show, most unexpectedly in the midst of the program – an absence that lasted almost a month – after NBC censors edited out a segment taped the night before about a joke involving a \"WC\" (\"water closet\", a polite term for a flush toilet) being confused for a \"wayside chapel\". As he left his desk, he said, \"I am leaving \"The Tonight Show\". There must be a better way of making a living than this\". Paar's abrupt departure left his startled announcer to finish the late-night broadcast himself.\n\nPaar returned to the show on March 7, 1960, strolled on stage after the opening credits, struck a pose, and said, \". . . . As I was saying before I was interrupted . . . \" After the audience erupted in applause, Paar continued: \"when I walked off, I said there must be a better way of making a living. Well, I've looked  – – – and there isn't!\"\n\nCiting that he would prefer to do one prime-time show per week rather than five late-night installments, Paar left the show in March 1962. The guests on the last show were Jack E. Leonard, Alexander King, Robert Merrill and Buddy Hackett. Among those appearing in taped farewell messages were Richard Nixon, Robert Kennedy, Billy Graham, Bob Hope and Jack Benny. Hugh Downs was the announcer, and Jose Melis led the band.\" The Jack Paar Show\" was moved to the evening's prime time (as \"The Jack Paar Program\") and aired weekly on Friday nights through the 1965 season.\n\nJohnny Carson (1925–2005) was chosen as Paar's successor. Carson was host at the time of the weekday afternoon quiz show \"Who Do You Trust?\" on the newest and then lowest-rated radio and television network, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC, which, as the \"Blue Network,\" had been separated from NBC in 1943 owing to government pressure). Because Carson was under contract through September to ABC and producer Don Fedderson (who held him to his contract until the day it expired), he could not take over as host until October 1, 1962. The months between Paar and Carson were filled by a series of guest hosts including Art Linkletter (4 weeks), Merv Griffin (4 weeks), Hugh Downs (2 weeks), Joey Bishop (2 weeks), Bob Cummings, Jack Carter, Jan Murray, Peter Lind Hayes, Soupy Sales, Mort Sahl, Steve Lawrence, Jerry Lewis (2 weeks), Jimmy Dean, Florence Henderson, Arlene Francis, Jack E. Leonard, Groucho Marx, Hal March and Donald O'Connor, many of whom later noted they were being led to believe they were auditioning for the job; Henderson and Francis were among the very first women to ever host a late-night talk show. Griffin was so well received as a guest host that NBC gave him his own daytime talk show, the first of three he would host in his broadcasting career, which debuted the same day Carson took over the late night show, and Lewis's two-week stint was so successful that NBC seriously considered retracting their offer to Carson. Lewis subsequently wound up hosting a lavish 2-hour prime time talk show for ABC entitled \"The Jerry Lewis Show\" while also making movies, which was famously unsuccessful.\n\nThe show was broadcast under the title \"The Tonight Show\" during this interregnum, with Skitch Henderson returning as bandleader. Hugh Downs remained as announcer/sidekick until taking over hosting duties on \"Today\" in September, at which point he was replaced by Ed Herlihy.\n\nGroucho Marx introduced Carson as the new host on October 1, 1962. Ed McMahon was Carson's announcer and on-screen side-kick, the same role he'd filled on \"Who Do You Trust?\". McMahon also introduced Carson with the drawn out catchphrase \"Heeeeeeeeeeeeeere's Johnny!\" \"The Tonight Show\" orchestra was, for Carson's first four years, still led by Skitch Henderson. After a brief stint by Milton DeLugg, beginning in 1967 the \"NBC Orchestra\" was then headed by trumpeter Doc Severinsen who had played in the band during the Henderson era. [See \"Music and Announcers\" below.] For all but a few months of its first decade on the air, Carson's \"Tonight Show\" was based in New York City. In 1972, the show moved to Burbank, California into Studio One of NBC Studios West Coast (although it was announced as coming from nearby Hollywood) for the remainder of his tenure.\n\nCarson lacked the mercurial, electric personality of Paar, and his version of \"The Tonight Show\" never riveted the country's attention the way that Paar's had, but his more predictable approach eventually became part of the cultural landscape by dint of the fact that the viewership, in a basically three-network paradigm, was infinitely more monolithic than it later became. Examples include when he played the game \"Twister\" with Eva Gabor in 1966, which sent the relatively unknown game's sales skyrocketing. In December 1973, when Carson joked about an alleged shortage of toilet paper, panic buying and hoarding ensued across the United States as consumers emptied stores, causing a real shortage that lasted for weeks. Stores and toilet paper manufacturers had to ration supplies until the panic ended.\n\nCarson's ratings usually substantially led his timeslot, in spite of the fact that he intermittently faced a litany of other late-night competitors including Les Crane, Bill Dana, David Frost, Regis Philbin, Alan Thicke, Jerry Lewis, Joan Rivers, David Brenner, Pat Sajak, Ron Reagan, Dennis Miller, and most notably Steve Allen, Arsenio Hall, Joey Bishop, Merv Griffin, and Dick Cavett (Carson saw his friend Cavett as his real competition but Cavett was on ABC, a much smaller network at the time).\n\nAs primetime variety shows such as \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" faded in prominence over the course of the 1970s, Carson's \"Tonight Show\" emerged as a showcase for all kinds of talent, as well as continuing the tradition of a vaudeville-style variety show. Carson's show continued Paar's tradition of launching the careers of a number of comedians, in Carson's case including Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman, Joan Rivers, Jeff Foxworthy, Ellen DeGeneres, David Brenner, Tim Allen, Drew Carey, and Roseanne Barr.\n\nJohnny Carson retired after three decades in the long-time hosts' chair behind the familiar iconic late-night desk on May 22, 1992, and was replaced by Jay Leno amid national and media controversy. David Letterman not only wanted to move into that earlier time slot from his \"Late Night\" spot (which had been broadcast following Carson's program) after \"The Tonight Show\", but was considered personally by Carson (whose opinion was not revealed until several years later) as his natural successor despite Leno having been Carson's permanent guest host for several years. Letterman, having had his heart set on the earlier time slot in spite of Leno's ratings success as recurring substitute host, left NBC (on Carson's advice) and joined rival network CBS. Their new program and entry into the late-night television universe, \"Late Show with David Letterman\", airing in the same slot, competed head to head against \"The Tonight Show\" with Leno in the host's chair and behind that iconic desk, for the better part of two decades, although Leno consistently enjoyed higher ratings after the first two years.\n\nOn September 27, 2004, the 50th anniversary of the show's premiere, NBC announced that Jay Leno would be succeeded by Conan O'Brien in 2009. The network shocked Leno, who had been consistently number one in the time period, when he was told that he would be fired in five years, with O'Brien taking over the slot at that time. Leno told his audience about this unique network decision at the beginning of his next show, mentioning that he'd accepted it, noting that he wanted to avoid repeating the hard feelings that had somehow developed with Letterman, and called O'Brien \"certainly the most deserving person for the job\" in the wake of his (Leno's) eventual departure. Five years later, what was to have been the final episode of \"The Tonight Show\" with Leno as host aired on Friday, May 29, 2009.\n\nNot wanting Leno, who remained number one in the ratings, to move to a competing network, NBC signed the host to a new contract to host a new prime-time talk show beginning in September 2009, entitled \"The Jay Leno Show\", with a format similar to his \"Tonight Show\" except that he was contractually prohibited from using a desk on the show. In a departure from network programming conventions of the time, the new show aired every weeknight at 10 p.m. Eastern/Pacific, competing with expensively produced narrative series on other networks and leading into affiliates' local news broadcasts and O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\".\n\nConan O'Brien replaced Leno as host on \"The Tonight Show\" on Monday, June 1 from a lavish newly constructed studio inside Stage 1 of the Universal Studios Hollywood back lot, temporarily ending an era (since 1972) of recording the show in Burbank.\n\nAfter a strong debut week, O'Brien’s total audience fell precipitously over the summer months, and the program began losing to \"Late Show with David Letterman\" in overall ratings. In contrast, O'Brien's performance in the crucial 18–49 demographic was favorable, and it was found that he had brought down the median age of \"The Tonight Show\" audience by a decade compared with his predecessor, indicating that a generational shift was taking effect as O'Brien established himself in an earlier timeslot. Taking this into account, columnist Tom Shales assessed in August 2009 that O’Brien was in a better position than Leno had been when he began his \"Tonight Show\" run in 1992; Leno consistently lost to Letterman in the ratings for eighteen months before eventually cementing his number one status.\n\n\"The Jay Leno Show\" debuted in September 2009, three months into O'Brien's \"Tonight Show\" tenure, performing to significantly lower ratings than the primetime dramas it had replaced on NBC and trailing the competition. NBC had expected the drop, having calculated that lower ratings would be balanced by a talk show’s correspondingly lower expense compared to more popular scripted programming. In the 11:35 period, \"The Late Show\" would largely maintain its lead over \"The Tonight Show\" in total viewers in early Fall, during which Letterman was receiving tabloid attention due to a blackmail scandal. In addition, \"The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien\" was in the unusual situation of being a talk show following a talk show hosted by its predecessor on the same network, and the booking war that resulted often left \"The Tonight Show\" getting second dibs on guests. One publicist reported that the aggression was such that \"The Jay Leno Show\" had signaled to potential guests that doing O'Brien's program before Leno's would be punished with secondary placement in the line-up.\n\nThough NBC claimed that the performance of \"The Jay Leno Show\" offered no surprises and that O'Brien was meeting expectations as well, the network had failed to anticipate the impact that Leno's weaker 10pm lead-in would have on the local 11pm news, which suffered a drastic drop in ratings (between 25%–50% nationwide) as a demonstrable result. As the affiliates rely on the revenue generated during the news, this generated a furor from the local stations and placed pressure on NBC to quickly fix the 10pm situation, which was contributing to a cascading effect on the ratings of \"The Tonight Show with Conan O’Brien\" and \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\".\n\nOn January 7, 2010, multiple media outlets reported that beginning March 1, 2010, Leno would move from his 10 p.m. weeknight time slot back to the traditional \"Tonight Show\" slot at 11:35. Under this proposal, Leno's show would be shortened from an hour to 30 minutes, which would make the monologue, Leno’s most popular segment, the essence of the program. This would move \"The Tonight Show\" to 12:05 a.m., a post-midnight start for the first time in its sixty-year history, while \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" would be pushed to 1:05am, and \"Last Call with Carson Daly\" would likely be cancelled. Under NBC’s (later contested) interpretation of O’Brien’s contract, the host was only guaranteed \"The Tonight Show\" in name rather than the 11:35pm slot with which it was synonymous.\n\nOn January 10, NBC confirmed it would be moving Jay Leno out of primetime as of February 12 and intended to move him back to late-night as soon as possible. TMZ reported that O'Brien was given no advance notice of this change, and that NBC offered him a choice: \"The Tonight Show\" in a 12:05 a.m. time slot, or the option to leave the network. On January 12, O'Brien issued a press release that stated he would not continue with \"Tonight\" if it was moved to a 12:05 a.m. time slot, saying, \"I believe that delaying \"The Tonight Show\" into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. \"The Tonight Show\" at 12:05 simply isn't \"The Tonight Show.\"\" \n\nWhen Oprah Winfrey later quoted this statement to Leno during an episode of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" in the aftermath of the fallout, he responded: \"Well, if you look at where [Conan's \"Tonight Show\"] ratings were, it was already destructive to the franchise\".\nLeno received criticism for his remark, which contradicted his statement that \"I think Conan is doing fine\" mere months earlier, after which O’Brien’s ratings were on an upward trend. Some observers considered the portrayal of O'Brien's ouster as being specifically about the host’s ratings to be spin, as it ignored O'Brien's far less expensive contract (and thus far less expensive buyout), O'Brien's improving ratings before the controversy, and O'Brien's younger demographics, all of which suggested profitability.\n\nAfter the decision was made to reinstate Leno, NBC executives and Leno maintained in the media that O'Brien's ratings were responsible for his removal from the traditional \"Tonight Show\" time slot, while O'Brien's supporters argued that the incumbent host had been denied the unambiguous transition, network support and time to grow that his predecessor had received. In addition, it was pointed out that Leno's 10PM program, rather than O'Brien's performance, had forced the need for line-up changes, while Leno's penalty clause all but guaranteed his continued presence on NBC late night after the cancellation of his primetime show. O'Brien's ratings surge during the controversy was also seen by some of his proponents as having the potential to be the host's \"Hugh Grant moment\" – an allusion to an interview fifteen months into \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" that aired shortly after the British actor had been caught publicly soliciting a prostitute. Leno's interview with Grant was widely watched due to the scandal, and Leno's fortunes in his rivalry with Letterman permanently turned around in its wake. \n\nThat O'Brien being the cheaper host to lose was the cardinal factor in NBC's decision to negotiate his departure was advanced by the \"New York Post\", which claimed that Leno had an \"ironclad\" guarantee for $150 million if he had been taken off the air, far higher than what it would cost for O'Brien to depart network. Skip Brittenham, an entertainment attorney and partner at the law firm that had authored Leno’s contract, was later asked about this claim in an interview. Though Brittenham refused to comment on the veracity of the publicly reported penalty figure, he allowed that \"I think the facts speak for themselves.\"\n\nOn January 21, it was announced that NBC had struck a deal with O'Brien in which he would leave \"The Tonight Show\" and receive a $33 million payout – effectively a buyout of his three-year contract, which was reputed to be approximately $12 million a year. NBC's earlier position that O'Brien did not have time slot protection was seemingly abandoned by implication, as in that scenario O'Brien would have been in breach of contract by refusing to move the show and presumably entitled to no such compensation. O'Brien's staff of almost 200 would receive $12 million divided in their departure, making the total of the settlement $45 million. O'Brien's final episode aired on Friday, January 22, ending his relationship with NBC after 22 years. Leno resumed hosting \"The Tonight Show\" on March 1, 2010.\n\nO'Brien returned to late-night television on November 8, 2010, (after his non-compete agreement expired) hosting the self-owned \"Conan\" on cable channel TBS. Conan remains partnered with TBS, having been renewed by the network through 2022. Leno would step down from \"The Tonight Show\" a second time in 2014. Hosting duties were taken over by Jimmy Fallon, who like O'Brien before him was seen as being able to attract a younger audience than Leno.\n\nOn March 1, 2010, Jay Leno returned to \"The Tonight Show\", with Wally Wingert as his announcer. On April 12, 2010, bandleader Kevin Eubanks announced his departure after 18 years (15 years as bandleader) on May 28. Rickey Minor replaced him as bandleader on June 7. On July 1, 2010, \"Variety\" reported that only six months into its second life, Jay Leno's \"Tonight Show\" posted its lowest ratings since 1992. By September 2010, Leno's ratings had fallen below O'Brien's when he had hosted \"The Tonight Show\", although O'Brien's ratings had spiked during the show's final days during the media publicity onslaught, and this tally pivots upon that anomalous spike in O'Brien's ratings. NBC ratings specialist Tom Bierbaum commented that due to the host being out of late-night television for a period of time and the subsequent 2010 \"Tonight Show\" conflict, Leno's ratings fall was \"not a surprise at all.\" In October 2010, David Letterman beat Leno's program in the ratings, for the first time since Leno returned to hosting \"The Tonight Show.\" By May 2011, however, Leno regained the lead over Letterman and held it until leaving the show in February 2014. In August 2012, The \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that \"The Tonight Show\" was in trouble for a number of reasons, notably that NBC was losing money. The \"Times\" later elaborated, noting that advertising revenue from \"The Tonight Show\" had dropped more than 40% since 2007, from $255.9 million annually to $146.1 million. Still, despite these problems, during 2012–13, \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" was consistently the highest-ranking late-night show, regularly achieving audiences of over 3.5 million, according to Nielsen ratings. Leno's audience became considerably smaller after its peak 2002–03 season, when it routinely attracted 5.8 million viewers a night. This was partly due to the continuing fragmentation of the TV audience, with an increasing number of cable shows, such as \"The Daily Show with Jon Stewart\", \"The Colbert Report\" and Conan O'Brien's new show on TBS, in addition to competition with Letterman on CBS and since January 8, 2013, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" on ABC, although Leno continued to lead the time slot. \n\nOn April 3, 2013, after a dispute with the network over Leno's joking about the network's poor prime time performance in his monologues, NBC announced that Leno would retire in 2014, with \"Late Night\" host Jimmy Fallon taking over \"The Tonight Show\" after the conclusion of NBC's coverage of the 2014 Winter Olympics. It was Leno's suggestion to use NBC's coverage of the Olympics as a springboard for Fallon's tenure. The date was later moved up a week to February 17, midway through the Olympics.\n\nLeno's last \"Tonight Show\" aired on February 6, 2014, featuring guests Billy Crystal (Leno's first guest in 1992) and Garth Brooks. Leno gave a tearful goodbye at the end of the program, calling himself \"the luckiest guy in the world\", and reflecting on his time as host as \"the greatest 22 years of my life.\"\n\nJimmy Fallon (who had hosted \"The Tonight Show\"s follow-up show, \"Late Night\", since 2009) assumed \"The Tonight Show\" hosting role on February 17, 2014, with his initial guests being Will Smith and the rock band U2, plus an assortment of celebrity cameos, including an appearance by one of Fallon's direct broadcast competitors, Stephen Colbert (who would later replace David Letterman on the competing \"The Late Show\" in 2015), and another by former permanent guest host Joan Rivers, making her first appearance on \"Tonight\" since cutting ties with Carson in 1986. The show's opening sequence was directed by filmmaker Spike Lee.\n\nAs part of the transition to Fallon, \"The Tonight Show\" would be brought back to New York City after 42 years in Southern California. Approximately $5 million was budgeted to renovate Studio 6B, where Fallon recorded \"Late Night\". The move also enabled NBC to take advantage of a newly enacted New York state tax credit for talk shows that are \"filmed before a studio audience of at least 200, as long as they carry a production budget of at least $30 million and have been shot outside New York for at least five seasons.\" Studio 6B is also where Jack Paar and Johnny Carson hosted \"The Tonight Show\" before the show moved to Burbank in 1972. Lorne Michaels (producer of \"Saturday Night Live\", in which Fallon appeared prior to hosting \"Late Night\") became executive producer of \"The Tonight Show\".\n\nFallon's \"Tonight Show\" has gone on the road to produce episodes remotely in its first year, spending four days at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida in June 2014 to promote new attractions at NBCUniversal's theme parks there. In February 2015, Fallon presented a special Sunday night show from Phoenix, Arizona airing after NBC's coverage of Super Bowl XLIX, followed by four days of shows in Stage 1 at Universal Studios Hollywood in Los Angeles (where Conan O'Brien's version was produced).\n\nAside from the title change and a new set, Fallon's version of \"The Tonight Show\" is nearly identical to the format of \"Late Night\" he employed, as he imported many of his signature comedy bits and much of his \"Late Night\" staff, including house band The Roots and announcer Steve Higgins. Prior to the transition, Fallon said, \"In our heads, we've been doing \"The Tonight Show\" for five years. We're just on at a later hour.\"\n\nMusic during the show's introduction and commercial segues is supplied by The Tonight Show Band. This ensemble was a jazz big band until the end of Johnny Carson's tenure. Skitch Henderson was the bandleader during the Steve Allen and early Carson years, followed briefly by Milton DeLugg (who had previously led the band on \"Broadway Open House\" and later became the musical director of \"The Gong Show\"). Gene Rayburn served as Allen's announcer and sidekick and also guest-hosted some episodes all the way through the early part of Carson's run. The Lou Stein Trio originally provided musical accompaniment during the short run of \"Tonight! America After Dark\", which ran for six months between the Steve Allen/Ernie Kovacs and Jack Paar eras of \"The Tonight Show\", but was later replaced by the Mort Lindsey Quartet, which in turn, was replaced by the Johnny Guarnieri Quartet. José Melis led the band for Jack Paar, and, after a short while of using comic actor Franklin Pangborn, Hugh Downs was Paar's announcer. For most of Johnny Carson's run on the show, the show's band, then called \"The NBC Orchestra\" was led by Doc Severinsen, former trumpet soloist in Henderson's band for Steve Allen.\n\nWhen McMahon was away from the show, Severinsen was the substitute announcer and Tommy Newsom would lead the band. (Newsom also took over when Severinsen was absent from the show.) On the rare occasions that both McMahon \"and\" Severinsen were away, Newsom would take the announcer's chair and the band would be led by assistant musical director Shelly Cohen.\n\nSeverinsen's big band featured several accomplished sidemen in addition to saxophonist Newsom, including trumpeter Snooky Young, pianist Ross Tompkins, drummer Ed Shaughnessy, trumpeter John Audino, trumpeter Conte Candoli, saxophonist Pete Christlieb, and jazz trumpet legend Clark Terry. The band frequently appeared on camera in the \"Stump the Band\" segments, where an audience member would dare the band to play some obscure song title, and the band would comically improvise something appropriate. The routine was played for full comedy value and the band was not really expected to know the songs, but on two occasions the band did answer correctly, much to the maestro's surprise. Severinsen was heard to ask incredulously, \"You mean we \"actually\"...?\"\n\nWhen Carson's tenure ended in 1992, the orchestra was axed and replaced by a smaller ensemble. The first bandleader during Leno's tenure was Branford Marsalis. In 1992, The Tonight Show Band also welcomed its first female member, Vicki Randle. In 1995, Kevin Eubanks replaced Marsalis, though the Marsalis-written theme was used throughout Leno's first tenure. On March 29, 2004, John Melendez from \"The Howard Stern Show\" replaced Leno's long-time announcer Edd Hall.\n\nConan O'Brien announced on the February 18, 2009, episode of \"Late Night\" that The Max Weinberg 7 (rechristened as The Tonight Show Band, and adding a second percussionist), the house band on that program, would be accompanying him to \"The Tonight Show\" as his version's house band. It was announced February 23, 2009, that former \"Late Night\" sidekick Andy Richter would be O'Brien's announcer. Richter replaced O'Brien's former long-time announcer Joel Godard (who stayed behind in New York) when his rendition of \"The Tonight Show\" began.\n\nFor the second incarnation of \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", a new bandleader was selected, though original bandleader Kevin Eubanks returned for a few weeks in the transition. He officially announced his departure after 18 years on April 12, 2010, with his final episode airing May 28. Rickey Minor was announced as his replacement, and took over on June 7. The show also inaugurated a new theme tune composed by Minor.\n\nWith the return of Leno's \"Tonight Show\" in March 2010, Melendez continued in the writing role, which he was assigned to on the prime-time \"The Jay Leno Show\", although the announcing duty went to Wally Wingert.\n\nJimmy Fallon began hosting \"The Tonight Show\" on February 17, 2014; his house band on \"Late Night\", The Roots, joined him, as did announcer Steve Higgins.\n\n\"The Tonight Show\" began its broadcast at 11:15 p.m. ET, following an affiliate's 15-minute news broadcast. As more affiliates lengthened their local news programs to 30 minutes, the show began doing two openings, one for the affiliates that began at 11:15 and another for those who joined at 11:30. By early 1965, only 43 of the 190 affiliated stations carried the entire show. After February 1965, Johnny Carson refused to appear until 11:30, and Ed McMahon \"hosted\" the 11:15 segment. Carson was not happy with this arrangement since McMahon's monologue covered the same ground as Carson's, and he finally insisted that the show's start time be changed to 11:30. As a result, the two-opening practice was eliminated in December 1966.\n\nWhen the show began it was broadcast live. On January 12, 1959, the show began to be videotaped for broadcast later on the same day, although initially the Thursday night programs were kept live. Color broadcasts began on September 19, 1960.\n\n\"The Tonight Show\" became the first American television program to broadcast with MTS stereo sound in 1984, at first sporadically, by audio engineer Ron Estes. Regular use of MTS began in 1985. In September 1991, the show postponed its starting time by five minutes to 11:35, to give network affiliates the opportunity to sell more advertising on their local news. On April 26, 1999, the show started broadcasting in 1080i HDTV, becoming the first American nightly talk show to be shot in that format.\n\nOn March 19, 2009, \"The Tonight Show\" became the first late-night talk show in history to have the sitting President of the United States as a guest, when President Barack Obama visited.\n\nThroughout the years, the time when \"The Tonight Show\" aired and the length has changed multiple times.\n\n§Note that many NBC affiliates chose not to carry the first fifteen minutes of the show during this period, instead preferring to air a local newscast from 11 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. As of February 1965, Carson refused to host the first 15 minutes of the program, preferring to wait until the full network was in place before delivering his opening monologue; Ed McMahon hosted the program's first 15 minutes instead. This persisted for nearly two years, until the show's start time was finally adjusted to 11:30 p.m. in January 1967.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1975, until the advent of \"Saturday Night Live\", weekend repeats of \"The Tonight Show\" were staples of the NBC schedule. These repeats ran in the following time slots:\n\nAllen\n\nKovacs\n\nPaar\n\nCarson\n\n\nLeno\n\n\nO'Brien\n\n\nFallon\n\nMany of Fallon's sketches moved over from \"Late Night\".\n\n\"The Tonight Show\" airs on E! Australia and ABC Comedy in Australia, CTV 2 & Access in Canada, E! Europe in the UK, CNBC in Europe, Comedy Central in India, CNBC in Pakistan, Jack TV in the Philippines, OSN in the Middle East and North Africa, and CNBC in Sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\"The Tonight Show\" is also seen around the world. It is broadcast on CNBC Europe, usually three nights after it has been shown in the U.S. The show is screened at 10.30 p.m. AEDST weeknights on The Comedy Channel in Australia, where new episodes are shown hours after its American broadcast. In Sweden, Kanal 5 has shown \"The Tonight Show\" (as \"Jay Leno Show\") since the late 1990s with one week's delay. Since October 2006, it is also being aired in India on Zee Cafe 12 hours after the show is shown in the USA. However, for the Jimmy Fallon edition of the show, Comedy Central has been airing the show 12 hours after the US broadcast since October 27, 2014.\n\nIn addition to its broadcast on CNBC Europe, \"The Tonight Show\" airs on \"One\" in Germany, with German subtitles, weekdays at 11:00 p.m., one day after its American broadcast.\n\nIn India and Sri Lanka \"The Tonight Show\" airs on Comedy Central India on Weeknights at 11pm IST/SLST – within 24 hours of the U.S Broadcast.\n\nAlso, in Sri Lanka CNBC Asia (CNBCLife) airs back-to-back editions of the show on weekends.\n\nAn early attempt at airing the show by London Weekend Television in the United Kingdom during the early 1980s was unsuccessful, sparking jokes by Carson. On the October 23, 1984, broadcast, guest Paul McCartney had this to say of the show's British run:\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1409389", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1409389", "title": "The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)", "text": "The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)\n\nThe Twilight Zone (marketed as Twilight Zone for its final two seasons) is an American anthology television series created and presented by Rod Serling, which ran for five seasons on CBS from 1959 to 1964. Each episode presents a stand-alone story in which characters find themselves dealing with often disturbing or unusual events, an experience described as entering \"the Twilight Zone,\" often with a surprise ending and a moral. Although predominantly science-fiction, the show's paranormal and Kafkaesque events leaned the show towards fantasy and horror. The phrase “twilight zone,” inspired by the series, is used to describe surreal experiences.\n\nThe series featured both established stars and younger actors who would become much better known later. Serling served as executive producer and head writer; he wrote or co-wrote 92 of the show's 156 episodes. He was also the show's host and narrator, delivering monologues at the beginning and end of each episode. Serling's opening and closing narrations usually summarize the episode's events encapsulating how and why the main character(s) had entered the Twilight Zone.\n\nIn 1997, the episodes \"To Serve Man\" (directed by Richard L. Bare) and \"It's a Good Life\" (directed by James Sheldon) were respectively ranked at 11 and 31 on \"TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\". Serling himself stated that his favorite episodes of the series were \"The Invaders\" (directed by Douglas Heyes) and \"Time Enough at Last\" (directed by John Brahm). \n\nIn 2016, the series was ranked No. 7 on \"Rolling Stone\"s list of the 100 greatest shows of all time. In 2002, \"The Twilight Zone\" was ranked No. 26 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2004, it was ranked #8 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever, moving to #9 three years later. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the third best-written TV series ever and \"TV Guide\" ranked it as the fourth greatest drama, the second greatest sci-fi show and the fifth greatest show of all time.\n\nBy the late 1950s, Rod Serling was a prominent name in American television. His successful television plays included \"Patterns\" (for \"Kraft Television Theater\") and \"Requiem for a Heavyweight\" (for \"Playhouse 90\"), but constant changes and edits made by the networks and sponsors frustrated Serling. In \"Requiem for a Heavyweight,\" the line \"Got a match?\" had to be struck because the sponsor sold lighters; other programs had similar striking of words that might remind viewers of competitors to the sponsor, including one case in which the sponsor, Ford Motor Company, had the Chrysler Building removed from a picture of the New York City skyline.\n\nAccording to comments in his 1957 anthology \"Patterns,\" Serling had been trying to delve into material more controversial than his works of the early 1950s. This led to \"Noon on Doomsday\" for the \"United States Steel Hour\" in 1956, a commentary by Serling on\nthe defensiveness and total lack of repentance he saw in the Mississippi town where the murder of Emmett Till took place. His original script closely paralleled the Till case, then was moved out of the South and the victim changed to a Jewish pawnbroker, and eventually watered down to just a foreigner in an unnamed town. Despite bad reviews, activists sent numerous letters and wires protesting the production.\n\nSerling thought that a science-fictional setting, with robots, aliens and other supernatural occurrences, would give him more freedom and less interference in expressing controversial ideas than more realistic settings. \"The Time Element\" was Serling's 1957 pilot pitch for his show, a time travel adventure about a man who travels back to Honolulu in 1941 and unsuccessfully tries to warn everyone about the impending attack on Pearl Harbor. The script, however, was rejected and shelved for a year until Bert Granet discovered and produced it as an episode of \"Desilu Playhouse\" in 1958. The show was a great success and enabled Serling to finally begin production on his anthology series, \"The Twilight Zone\". Serling's editorial sense of ironic fate in the writing done for the series was identified as significant to its success by the BFI Film Classics library which stated that for Serling \"the cruel indifference and implacability of fate and the irony of poetic justice\" were recurrent themes in his plots.\n\n\"The Twilight Zone\" premiered the night of October 2, 1959, to rave reviews. \"\"Twilight Zone\" is about the only show on the air that I actually look forward to seeing. It's the one series that I will let interfere with other plans\", said Terry Turner for the \"Chicago Daily News\". Others agreed. \"Daily Variety\" ranked it with \"the best that has ever been accomplished in half-hour filmed television\" and the \"New York Herald Tribune\" found the show to be \"certainly the best and most original anthology series of the year\".\n\nEven as the show proved popular to television's critics, it struggled to find a receptive audience of television viewers. CBS was banking on a rating of at least 21 or 22, but its initial numbers were much worse. The series' future was jeopardized when its third episode, \"Mr. Denton on Doomsday\" earned a 16.3 rating. Still, the show attracted a large enough audience to survive a brief hiatus in November, after which it finally surpassed its competition on ABC and NBC and convinced its sponsors (General Foods and Kimberly-Clark) to stay on until the end of the season.\n\nWith one exception (\"The Chaser\"), the first season featured scripts written only by Rod Serling, Charles Beaumont or Richard Matheson. These three were responsible for 127 of the 156 episodes in the series. Additionally, with one exception (\"A World of His Own\"), Serling never appeared on camera during any first-season episode (as he would in future seasons), and was present only as a voice-over narrator. Serling did appear on screen in \"Twilight Zone\" promotional spots plugging the following week's episode – just not in the episodes themselves. These promo spots were unseen for several decades after their initial airings; while many have been released in the DVD and Blu-ray releases of \"The Twilight Zone\", a few are lost completely and some survive only as audio tracks. Most are available through CBS All Access when watching the full episodes.\n\nMany of the season's episodes proved to be among the series' most celebrated, including \"Time Enough at Last,\" \"The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street,\" \"Walking Distance,\" and \"The After Hours.\" The first season won Serling an unprecedented fourth Emmy Award for dramatic writing, a Producers Guild Award for Serling's creative partner Buck Houghton, a Directors Guild Award for John Brahm and the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation.\n\nBernard Herrmann's original opening theme music lasted throughout the first season. For the final four episodes of the season, the show's original surrealist \"pit and summit\" opening montage and narration was replaced by a piece featuring a blinking eye and shorter narration, and a truncated version of Herrmann's theme.\n\nSome first-season episodes were available for decades only in a version with a pasted-on second-season opening. These \"re-themed\" episodes were prepared for airing in the summer of 1961 as summer repeats; the producers wanted to have a consistent opening for the show every week. During the original 1959/60 run, Herrmann's theme was used in every first-season episode. The first season openings for these episodes have since been restored to recent DVD and Blu-ray reissues.\n\nThe second season premiered on September 30, 1960 with \"\"King Nine\" Will Not Return,\" Serling's fresh take on the pilot episode \"Where Is Everybody?\" The familiarity of this first story stood in stark contrast to the novelty of the show's new packaging: Bernard Herrmann's stately original theme was replaced by Marius Constant's more jarring and dissonant (and now more-familiar) new guitar-and-bongo theme. The blinking eye was replaced by a more surreal introduction inspired by the new images in Serling's narration (such as \"That's the signpost up ahead\"), and Serling himself stepped in front of the cameras to present his opening narration, rather than being only a voice-over narrator (as in the first season).\n\nA new sponsor, Colgate-Palmolive, replaced the previous year's Kimberly-Clark (as Liggett & Myers would succeed General Foods, in April 1961), and a new network executive, James Aubrey, took over CBS. \"Jim Aubrey was a very, very difficult problem for the show,\" said associate producer Del Reisman. \"He was particularly tough on \"The Twilight Zone\" because for its time it was a particularly costly half-hour show... Aubrey was real tough on [the show's budget] even when it was a small number of dollars.\" In a push to keep the show's expenses down, Aubrey ordered that seven fewer episodes be produced than last season and that six of those being produced would be shot on videotape rather than film, a move Serling disliked, calling it \"neither fish nor fowl.\" Two additional episodes filmed in the second season (\"The Grave\" and \"Nothing in the Dark\") were held over to the third season.\n\nSeason two saw the production of many of the series' most acclaimed episodes, including \"Eye of the Beholder,\" \"Nick of Time,\" \"The Invaders,\" and \"Will the Real Martian Please Stand Up?.\" The trio of Serling, Matheson and Beaumont began to admit new writers, and this season saw the television debut of George Clayton Johnson. Emmys were won by Serling (his fifth) for dramatic writing and by director of photography George T. Clemens and, for the second year in a row, the series won the Hugo Award for best dramatic presentation. It also earned the Unity Award for \"Outstanding Contributions to Better Race Relations\" and an Emmy nomination for \"Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Drama.\"\n\nFive weeks into season two, the show's budget was showing a deficit. The total number of new episodes was projected at twenty-nine, more than half of which, sixteen, had already been filmed by November 1960. As a cost-cutting measure, six episodes (The Lateness of The Hour, The Night of The Meek, The Whole Truth, Twenty-Two, Static, and Long Distance Call) were produced in the cheaper videotape format, which also required fewer camera movements. In addition, videotape was a relatively primitive medium in the early 1960s; the editing of tape was next to impossible. Each of the episodes was therefore \"camera-cut\" as in live TV—on a studio sound stage, using a total of four cameras. The requisite multi-camera setup of the videotape experiment made location shooting difficult, severely limiting the potential scope of the story-lines. Even with those artistic sacrifices, the eventual savings amounted to only $6,000 per episode, far less than the cost of a single episode. The experiment was not attempted again. Kinescope versions of the video taped episodes were rerun in syndication.\n\nIn his third year as executive producer, host, narrator and primary writer for \"The Twilight Zone\", Serling was beginning to feel exhausted. \"I've never felt quite so drained of ideas as I do at this moment\", said the 37-year-old playwright at the time. In the first two seasons he contributed 48 scripts, or 73% of the show's total output; he contributed 56% of this season's output. \"The show now seems to be feeding off itself\", said a \"Variety\" reviewer of the season's episode two. Sponsors for this season included Chesterfield, Bufferin tablets, and Pepsi-Cola.\n\nDespite his avowed weariness, Serling again managed to produce several teleplays that are widely regarded as classics, including \"It's a Good Life\", \"To Serve Man\", \"Little Girl Lost\" and \"Five Characters in Search of an Exit\". Scripts by Montgomery Pittman and Earl Hamner, Jr. supplemented Matheson and Beaumont's output, and George Clayton Johnson submitted three teleplays that examined complex themes. The episode \"I Sing the Body Electric\" was contributed by sci-fi writer Ray Bradbury. By the end of the season, the series had reached over 100 episodes.\n\n\"The Twilight Zone\" received two Emmy nominations (for cinematography and art design), but was awarded neither. It again received the Hugo Award for \"Best Dramatic Presentation\", making it the only three-time recipient until it was tied by \"Doctor Who\" in 2008.\n\nIn spring 1962, \"The Twilight Zone\" was late in finding a sponsor for its fourth season and was replaced on CBS's fall schedule with a new hour-long situation comedy called \"Fair Exchange\". In the confusion that followed this apparent cancellation, producer Buck Houghton left the series for a position at Four Star Productions. Serling meanwhile accepted a teaching post at Antioch College, his alma mater. Though the series was eventually renewed, Serling's contribution as executive producer decreased in its final seasons.\n\nIn November 1962, CBS contracted \"Twilight Zone\" (now sans \"The\") as a mid-season January replacement for \"Fair Exchange,\" the very show that replaced it in the September 1962 schedule. In order to fill the \"Fair Exchange\" time slot each episode had to be expanded to an hour, an idea which did not sit well with the production crew. \"Ours is the perfect half-hour show... If we went to an hour, we'd have to fleshen our stories, soap opera style. Viewers could watch fifteen minutes without knowing whether they were in a \"Twilight Zone\" or \"Desilu Playhouse\",\" Serling responded. Herbert Hirschman was hired to replace long-time producer Buck Houghton. One of Hirschman's first decisions was to direct a new opening sequence, this one illustrating a door, eye, window and other objects suspended in space. His second task was to find and produce quality scripts. Sponsors included Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThis season of \"Twilight Zone\" once again turned to the reliable trio of Serling, Matheson and Beaumont. However, Serling’s input was limited this season; he still provided the lion’s share of the teleplays, but as executive producer he was virtually absent and as host, his artful narrations had to be shot back-to-back against a gray background during his infrequent trips to Los Angeles. Due to complications from a developing brain disease, Beaumont’s input also began to diminish significantly. Additional scripts were commissioned from Earl Hamner, Jr. and Reginald Rose to fill in the gap.\n\nWith five episodes left in the season, Hirschman received an offer to work on a new NBC series called \"Espionage\" and was replaced by Bert Granet, who had previously produced \"The Time Element\". Among Granet’s first assignments was \"On Thursday We Leave for Home,\" which Serling considered the season's most effective episode. There was an Emmy nomination for cinematography, and a nomination for the Hugo Award.\n\nSerling later claimed, \"I was writing so much, I felt I had begun to lose my perspective on what was good and what was bad\". By the end of this final season, he had contributed 92 scripts in five years. This season, the new alternate sponsors were American Tobacco and Procter & Gamble. The show returned to its half-hour format.\n\nBeaumont was now out of the picture almost entirely, contributing scripts only through the ghostwriters Jerry Sohl and John Tomerlin, and after producing only 13 episodes, Bert Granet left and was replaced by William Froug—with whom Serling had worked on \"Playhouse 90.\"\nFroug made a number of unpopular decisions; first by shelving several scripts purchased under Granet's term (including Matheson’s \"The Doll,\" which was nominated for a Writer's Guild Award when finally produced in 1986 on \"Amazing Stories\"); secondly, Froug alienated George Clayton Johnson when he hired Richard deRoy to completely rewrite Johnson’s teleplay \"Tick of Time,\" eventually produced as \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering.\" \"It makes the plot trivial,\" complained Johnson of the resulting script, insisting he be given screen credit for the final version of the episode as \"Johnson Smith.\" \"Tick of Time\" became Johnson’s final submission to \"The Twilight Zone.\"\n\nEven under these conditions, several episodes were produced that are well remembered, including \"Nightmare at 20,000 Feet,\" \"A Kind of a Stopwatch\", \"The Masks\" and \"Living Doll.\" Although this season received no Emmy recognition, episode number 142, \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\"—a 1962 French-produced short film which was modified slightly for broadcast—received the Academy Award for best short film in 1963.\n\nIn late January 1964, CBS announced the show's cancellation. \"For one reason or other, Jim Aubrey decided he was sick of the show... [H]e claimed that it was too far over budget and that the ratings weren't good enough\", explained Froug. But Serling countered by telling the \"Daily Variety\" that he had \"decided to cancel the network\". ABC showed interest in bringing the show over to their network under the new name \"Witches, Warlocks and Werewolves,\" but Serling was not impressed. \"The network executives seem to prefer weekly ghouls, and we have what appears to be a considerable difference in opinion. I don't mind my show being supernatural, but I don't want to be booked into a graveyard every week.\" Shortly afterwards Serling sold his 40% share in \"The Twilight Zone\" to CBS, leaving the show and all projects involving the supernatural behind him until 1969, when \"Night Gallery\" debuted.\n\nBeing an anthology series with no recurring characters, \"The Twilight Zone\" features a wide array of guest stars for each episode, some of whom appeared in multiple episodes. Many episodes feature early performances from actors who later became famous, such as Theodore Bikel, Bill Bixby, Lloyd Bochner, Morgan Brittany, Charles Bronson, Carol Burnett, Donna Douglas, Robert Duvall, Peter Falk, Constance Ford, Joan Hackett, Dennis Hopper, Ron Howard, Jim Hutton, Jack Klugman, Martin Landau, Cloris Leachman, Jean Marsh, Elizabeth Montgomery, Billy Mumy, Julie Newmar, Barbara Nichols, Leonard Nimoy, Robert Redford, Burt Reynolds, Janice Rule, William Shatner, Dean Stockwell, George Takei, Joyce Van Patten, Jack Warden, Jonathan Winters, and Dick York. Other episodes feature performances by actors later in their careers, such as Dana Andrews, Joan Blondell, Ann Blyth, Art Carney, Jack Carson, Gladys Cooper, William Demarest, Andy Devine, Cedric Hardwicke, Josephine Hutchinson, Buster Keaton, Ida Lupino, Kevin McCarthy, Burgess Meredith, Agnes Moorehead, Alan Napier, Franchot Tone, Mickey Rooney, and Ed Wynn.\n\nCharacter actors who appeared (some more than once) include John Anderson, John Dehner, Betty Garde, Sandra Gould, Nancy Kulp, Celia Lovsky, Eve McVeagh, Nehemiah Persoff, Albert Salmi, Vito Scotti, Olan Soule, Harold J. Stone, and Estelle Winwood. The actor who appears in the most episodes is Robert McCord.\n\nBesides Bernard Herrmann and Jerry Goldsmith, other contributors to the music were Nathan Van Cleave, Leonard Rosenman, Fred Steiner, and Franz Waxman. The first season featured an orchestral title theme by Herrmann, who also wrote original scores for seven of the episodes, including the premiere, \"Where Is Everybody?\". The guitar theme most associated with the show was written by the French avant-garde composer Marius Constant as part of a series of short cues commissioned by CBS as \"work made for hire\" library music for the series. The guitar player was Howard Roberts. Used from season two onward, the theme as aired was a splicing together of two of these library cues: \"Etrange 3 (Strange No. 3)\" and \"Milieu 2 (Middle No. 2)\". Varèse Sarabande released several albums of music from the series, focusing on the episodes that received original scores.\n\nVolume 1\n\nVolume 2\n\nVolume 3\n\nVolume 4\n\nVolume 5\n\nMany of the above were included on a four-disc set released by Silva America. Varese also released a two-disc set of re-recordings of Herrmann's seven scores for the series (\"Where Is Everybody?\", \"Walking Distance\", \"The Lonely\", \"Eye of the Beholder\", \"Little Girl Lost\", \"Living Doll\", and \"Ninety Years Without Slumbering\"), conducted by Joel McNeely. Alongside this release, Bernard Herrmann's score for the episode \"Walking Distance\" received another re-recording accompanying a new recording of his score for François Truffaut's \"Fahrenheit 451\" performed by the Moscow Symphony Orchestra, conducted by William T. Stromberg and released by Tribute Film Classics.\n\n\"The Twilight Zone\" was nominated for four Primetime Emmy Awards, winning two.\n\nMost episodes continue to be broadcast in syndication. After the cancellation of the series, Serling sold his rights to CBS, unaware of what the future would hold in syndication, and the royalties he would have gained.\n\nEpisodes are broadcast nationally on the Syfy channel in the United States. They are regularly shown in late-night slots, and in marathons aired typically every year on New Year's Eve and Day and the Fourth of July. Syfy broadcasts are often re-cut to feature more commercials during the time slot, in order to meet the 22 or 44-minute maximum episode runtime.\n\nOriginally, there were five episodes not included in the syndication package. Three of those (\"Sounds and Silences,\" \"Miniature,\" and \"A Short Drink From a Certain Fountain\") were involved in copyright infringement lawsuits. The other two, which have never been in syndication (both from season five), are \"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge\" (a French short film, aired twice per agreement with the filmmakers) and \"The Encounter\" (which was pulled after its initial showing, due to the racial overtones).\n\n\"The Twilight Zone\" was released on Region 1 DVD for the first time by Image Entertainment. All of the releases feature uncut episodes. The season releases (The Definitive Collection and Blu-rays) also include the radio dramas and the \"Next Week\" promos (some of the promos on the season DVDs are audio only). The various releases include:\n\n\nCompilations\n\nLimited set\n\nBlu-ray <br>\"Note\": all of the Blu-ray releases are Region A\n\nThe 1958 \"Desilu Playhouse\" episode, \"The Time Element,\" considered to be a \"first\" pilot for \"The Twilight Zone\" (see above) is included as a bonus feature on the Blu-ray release (with Season 1), but not on any of the earlier DVD releases.\n\nUK release\n\nFremantle Media released a box set for each season of \"The Twilight Zone\" on both DVD and Blu-ray over 2011 and early 2012. These sets received high praise and won an award from \"The Guardian\" for Best Special Features of 2011. These Blu-rays and DVDs are multi-region and so can be played around the world.\n\nIn 2002, producer Carl Amari licensed the rights to turn the TV series into a weekly radio drama series from CBS Enterprises and the Rod Serling Estate. The series features Stacy Keach in Rod Serling's role as narrator and each 40-minute audio drama includes a Hollywood celebrity in the starring role. Some of the stars include Jim Caviezel, Blair Underwood, Jason Alexander, Jane Seymour, Lou Diamond Phillips, Luke Perry, Michael York, Sean Astin, and Ernie Hudson. The episodes air nationally on hundreds of radio stations and Sirius/XM, and are available for download.\n\nAs of April 2019, all half-hour episodes (seasons 1–3 and 5) of the series are available on Netflix Instant Streaming in Brazil, Mexico, and the U.S.\n\nAll five seasons of the series are available on Hulu, Amazon Video, and iTunes.\n\nAll seasons as aired, including promotional spots recorded by Mr. Serling, are available on CBS All Access.\n\nThe series has seen three revivals:\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "36937", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=36937", "title": "Television network", "text": "Television network\n\nA television network or broadcaster is a telecommunications network for distribution of television program content, whereby a central operation provides programming to many television stations or pay television providers. Until the mid-1980s, television programming in most countries of the world was dominated by a small number of terrestrial networks. Many early television networks (such as the BBC, NBC or CBC) evolved from earlier radio networks.\n\nIn countries where most networks broadcast identical, centrally originated content to all of their stations and where most individual television transmitters therefore operate only as large \"repeater stations\", the terms \"television network\", \"television channel\" (a numeric identifier or radio frequency) and \"television station\" have become mostly interchangeable in everyday language, with professionals in television-related occupations continuing to make a differentiation between them. Within the industry, a tiering is sometimes created among groups of networks based on whether their programming is simultaneously originated from a central point, and whether the network master control has the technical and administrative capability to take over the programming of their affiliates in real-time when it deems this necessary – the most common example being during national breaking news events.\n\nIn North America in particular, many television networks available via cable and satellite television are branded as \"channels\" because they are somewhat different from traditional networks in the sense defined above, as they are singular operations – they have no affiliates or component stations, but instead are distributed to the public via cable or direct-broadcast satellite providers. Such networks are commonly referred to by terms such as \"specialty channels\" in Canada or \"cable networks\" in the U.S.\n\nA network may or may not produce all of its own programming. If not, production companies (such as Warner Bros. Television, Universal Television, Sony Pictures Television and TriStar Television) can distribute their content to the various networks, and it is common that a certain production firm may have programs that air on two or more rival networks. Similarly, some networks may import television programs from other countries, or use archived programming to help complement their schedules.\n\nSome stations have the capability to interrupt the network through the local insertion of television commercials, station identifications and emergency alerts. Others completely break away from the network for their own programming, a method known as regional variation. This is common where small networks are members of larger networks. The majority of commercial television stations are self-owned, even though a variety of these instances are the property of an owned-and-operated television network. The commercial television stations can also be linked with a noncommercial educational broadcasting agency. It is also important to note that some countries have launched national television networks, so that individual television stations can act as common repeaters of nationwide programs.\n\nOn the other hand, television networks also undergo the impending experience of major changes related to cultural varieties. The emergence of cable television has made available in major media markets, programs such as those aimed at American bi-cultural Latinos. Such a diverse captive audience presents an occasion for the networks and affiliates to advertise the best programming that needs to be aired.\n\nThis is explained by author Tim P. Vos in his abstract \"A Cultural Explanation of Early Broadcast\", where he determines targeted group/non-targeted group representations as well as the cultural specificity employed in the television network entity. Vos notes that policymakers did not expressly intend to create a broadcast order dominated by commercial networks. In fact, legislative attempts were made to limit the network's preferred position.\n\nAs to individual stations, modern network operations centers usually use broadcast automation to handle most tasks. These systems are not only used for programming and for video server playout, but use exact atomic time from Global Positioning Systems or other sources to maintain perfect synchronization with upstream and downstream systems, so that programming appears seamless to viewers.\n\nA major international television network is the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which is perhaps most well known for its news agency BBC News. Owned by the Crown, the BBC operates primarily in the United Kingdom. It is funded by the television licence paid by British residents that watch terrestrial television and as a result, no commercial advertising appears on its networks. Outside the UK, advertising is broadcast because the licence fee only applies to the BBC's British operations. 23,000 people worldwide are employed by the BBC and its subsidiary, BBC Studios.\n\nTelevision in the United States had long been dominated by the Big Three television networks, the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), CBS (formerly the Columbia Broadcasting System) and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC); however the Fox Broadcasting Company (Fox), which launched in October 1986, has gained prominence and is now considered part of the \"Big Four.\" The Big Three provide a significant number of programs to each of their affiliates, including newscasts, prime time, daytime and sports programming, but still reserve periods during each day where their affiliate can air local programming, such as local news or syndicated programs. Since the creation of Fox, the number of American television networks has increased, though the amount of programming they provide is often much less: for example, The CW Television Network only provides twelve hours of primetime programming each week (along with six hours on Saturdays and five hours a week during the daytime), leaving its affiliates to fill time periods where network programs are not broadcast with a large amount of syndicated programming. Other networks are dedicated to specialized programming, such as religious content or programs presented in languages other than English, particularly Spanish.\n\nThe largest television network in the United States, however, is the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), a non-profit, publicly owned, non-commercial educational service. In comparison to the commercial television networks, there is no central unified arm of broadcast programming, meaning that each PBS member station has a significant amount of freedom to schedule television shows as they consent to. Some public television outlets, such as PBS, carry separate digital subchannel networks through their member stations (for example, Georgia Public Broadcasting; in fact, some programs airing on PBS were branded on other channels as coming from GPB Kids and PBS World).\n\nThis works as each network sends its signal to many local affiliated television stations across the country. These local stations then carry the \"network feed,\" which can be viewed by millions of households across the country. In such cases, the signal is sent to as many as 200+ stations or as little as just a dozen or fewer stations, depending on the size of the network.\n\nWith the adoption of digital television, television networks have also been created specifically for distribution on the digital subchannels of television stations (including networks focusing on classic television series and films operated by companies like Weigel Broadcasting (owners of Movies! and Me-TV) and Tribune Broadcasting (owners of This TV and Antenna TV), along with networks focusing on music, sports and other niche programming).\n\nCable and satellite providers pay the networks a certain rate per subscriber (the highest charge being for ESPN, in which cable and satellite providers pay a rate of more than $5.00 per subscriber to ESPN). The providers also handle the sale of advertising inserted at the local level during national programming, in which case the broadcaster and the cable/satellite provider may share revenue. Networks that maintain a home shopping or infomercial format may instead pay the station or cable/satellite provider, in a brokered carriage deal. This is especially common with low-power television stations, and in recent years, even more so for stations that used this revenue stream to finance their conversion to digital broadcasts, which in turn provides them with several additional channels to transmit different programming sources.\n\nTelevision broadcasting in the United States was heavily influenced by radio. Early individual experimental radio stations in the United States began limited operations in the 1910s. In November 1920, Westinghouse signed on \"the world's first commercially licensed radio station\", KDKA in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Other companies built early radio stations in Detroit, Boston, New York City and other areas. Radio stations received permission to transmit through broadcast licenses obtained through the Federal Radio Commission (FRC), a government entity that was created in 1926 to regulate the radio industry. With few exceptions, radio stations east of the Mississippi River received official call signs beginning with the letter \"W\"; those west of the Mississippi were assigned calls beginning with a \"K\". The amount of programs that these early stations aired was often limited, in part due to the expense of program creation. The idea of a network system which would distribute programming to many stations simultaneously, saving each station the expense of creating all of their own programs and expanding the total coverage beyond the limits of a single broadcast signal, was devised.\n\nNBC set up the first permanent coast-to-coast radio network in the United States by 1928, using dedicated telephone line technology. The network physically linked individual radio stations, nearly all of which were independently owned and operated, in a vast chain, NBC's audio signal thus transmitted from station to station to listeners across the United States. Other companies, including CBS and the Mutual Broadcasting System, soon followed suit, each network signed hundreds of individual stations on as affiliates: stations which agreed to broadcast programs from one of the networks.\n\nAs radio prospered throughout the 1920s and 1930s, experimental television stations, which broadcast both an audio and a video signal, began sporadic broadcasts. Licenses for these experimental stations were often granted to experienced radio broadcasters, and thus advances in television technology closely followed breakthroughs in radio technology. As interest in television grew, and as early television stations began regular broadcasts, the idea of networking television signals (sending one station's video and audio signal to outlying stations) was born. However, the signal from an electronic television system, containing much more information than a radio signal, required a broadband transmission medium. Transmission by a nationwide series of radio relay towers would be possible but extremely expensive.\n\nResearchers at AT&T subsidiary Bell Telephone Laboratories patented coaxial cable in 1929, primarily as a telephone improvement device. Its high capacity (transmitting 240 telephone calls simultaneously) also made it ideal for long-distance television transmission, where it could handle a frequency band of 1 MHz. German television first demonstrated such an application in 1936 by relaying televised telephone calls from Berlin to Leipzig, away, by cable.\n\nAT&T laid the first L-carrier coaxial cable between New York City and Philadelphia, with automatic signal booster stations every , and in 1937 it experimented with transmitting televised motion pictures over the line. Bell Labs gave demonstrations of the New York–Philadelphia television link in 1940 and 1941. AT&T used the coaxial link to transmit the Republican National Convention in June 1940 from Philadelphia to New York City, where it was televised to a few hundred receivers over the NBC station W2XBS (which evolved into WNBC) as well as seen in Schenectady, New York via W2XB (which evolved into WRGB) via off-air relay from the New York station.\n\nNBC had earlier demonstrated an inter-city television broadcast on February 1, 1940, from its station in New York City to another in Schenectady, New York by General Electric relay antennas, and began transmitting some programs on an irregular basis to Philadelphia and Schenectady in 1941. Wartime priorities suspended the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 1, 1942 to October 1, 1945, temporarily shutting down expansion of television networking. However, in 1944 a short film, \"Patrolling the Ether\", was broadcast simultaneously over three stations as an experiment.\nAT&T made its first postwar addition in February 1946, with the completion of a cable between New York City and Washington, D.C., although a blurry demonstration broadcast showed that it would not be in regular use for several months. The DuMont Television Network, which had begun experimental broadcasts before the war, launched what \"Newsweek\" called \"the country's first permanent commercial television network\" on August 15, 1946, connecting New York City with Washington. Not to be outdone, NBC launched what it called \"the world's first regularly operating television network\" on June 27, 1947, serving New York City, Philadelphia, Schenectady and Washington. Baltimore and Boston were added to the NBC television network in late 1947. DuMont and NBC would be joined by CBS and ABC in 1948.\n\nIn the 1940s, the term \"chain broadcasting\" was used when discussing network broadcasts, as the television stations were linked together in long chains along the East Coast. But as the television networks expanded westward, the interconnected television stations formed major networks of connected affiliate stations. In January 1949, with the sign-on of DuMont's WDTV in Pittsburgh, the Midwest and East Coast networks were finally connected by coaxial cable (with WDTV airing the best shows from all four networks). By 1951, the four networks stretched from coast to coast, carried on the new microwave radio relay network of AT&T Long Lines. Only a few local television stations remained independent of the networks.\n\nEach of the four major television networks originally only broadcast a few hours of programs a week to their affiliate stations, mostly between 8:00 and 11:00 p.m. Eastern Time, when most viewers were watching television. Most of the programs broadcast by the television stations were still locally produced. As the networks increased the number of programs that they aired, however, officials at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) grew concerned that local television might disappear altogether. Eventually, the federal regulator enacted the Prime Time Access Rule, which restricted the amount of time that the networks could air programs; officials hoped that the rules would foster the development of quality local programs, but in practice, most local stations did not want to bear the burden of producing many of their own programs, and instead chose to purchase programs from independent producers. Sales of television programs to individual local stations are done through a method called \"broadcast syndication,\" and today nearly every television station in the United States obtains syndicated programs in addition to network-produced fare.\n\nLate in the 20th century, cross-country microwave radio relays were replaced by fixed-service satellites. Some terrestrial radio relays remained in service for regional connections.\n\nAfter the failure and shutdown of DuMont in 1956, several attempts at new networks were made between the 1950s and the 1970s, with little success. The Fox Broadcasting Company, founded by the Rupert Murdoch-owned News Corporation (now owned by Fox Corporation), was launched on October 9, 1986 after the company purchased the television assets of Metromedia; it would eventually ascend to the status of the fourth major network by 1994. Two other networks launched within a week of one another in January 1995: The WB Television Network, a joint venture between Time Warner and the Tribune Company, and the United Paramount Network (UPN), formed through a programming alliance between Chris-Craft Industries and Paramount Television (whose parent, Viacom, would later acquire half and later all of the network over the course of its existence). In September 2006, The CW was launched as a \"merger\" of The WB and UPN (in actuality, a consolidation of each respective network's higher-rated programs onto one schedule); MyNetworkTV, a network formed from affiliates of UPN and The WB that did not affiliate with The CW, launched at the same time.\n\nFCC regulations in the United States restricted the number of television stations that could be owned by any one network, company or individual. This led to a system where most local television stations were independently owned, but received programming from the network through a franchising contract, except in a few major cities that had owned-and-operated stations (O&O) of a network and independent stations. In the early days of television, when there were often only one or two stations broadcasting in a given market, the stations were usually affiliated with multiple networks and were able to choose which programs would air. Eventually, as more stations were licensed, it became common for each station to be exclusively affiliated with only one network and carry all of the \"prime-time\" programs that the network offered. Local stations occasionally break from regularly scheduled network programming however, especially when a breaking news or severe weather situation occurs in the viewing area. Moreover, when stations return to network programming from commercial breaks, station identifications are displayed in the first few seconds before switching to the network's logo.\n\nA number of different definitions of \"network\" are used by government agencies, industry, and the general public. Under the Broadcasting Act, a network is defined as \"any operation where control over all or any part of the programs or program schedules of one or more broadcasting undertakings is delegated to another undertaking or person,\" and must be licensed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC).\n\nOnly three national over-the-air television networks are currently licensed by the CRTC: government-owned CBC Television (English) and Ici Radio-Canada Télé (French), French-language private network TVA, and a network focused on Canada's indigenous peoples. A third French-language service, V, is licensed as a provincial network within Quebec, but is not licensed or locally distributed (outside of carriage on the digital tiers of pay television providers) on a national basis.\n\nCurrently, licensed national or provincial networks must be carried by all cable providers (in the country or province, respectively) with a service area above a certain population threshold, as well as all satellite providers. However, they are no longer necessarily expected to achieve over-the-air coverage in all areas (APTN, for example, only has terrestrial coverage in parts of northern Canada).\n\nIn addition to these licensed networks, the two main private English-language over-the-air services, CTV and Global, are also generally considered to be \"networks\" by virtue of their national coverage, although they are not officially licensed as such. CTV was previously a licensed network, but relinquished this licence in 2001 after acquiring most of its affiliates, making operating a network licence essentially redundant (per the above definition).\n\nSmaller groups of stations with common branding are often categorized by industry watchers as television systems, although the public and the broadcasters themselves will often refer to them as \"networks\" regardless. Some of these systems, such as CTV 2 and the now-defunct E!, essentially operate as mini-networks, but have reduced geographical coverage. Others, such as Omni Television or the Crossroads Television System, have similar branding and a common programming focus, but schedules may vary significantly from one station to the next. Citytv originally began operating as a television system in 2002 when CKVU-TV in Vancouver started to carry programs originating from CITY-TV in Toronto and adopted that station's \"Citytv\" branding, but gradually became a network by virtue of national coverage through expansions into other markets west of Atlantic Canada between 2005 and 2013.\n\nMost local television stations in Canada are now owned and operated directly by their network, with only a small number of stations still operating as affiliates.\n\nMost television services outside North America are national networks established by a combination of publicly funded broadcasters and commercial broadcasters. Most nations established television networks in a similar way: the first television service in each country was operated by a public broadcaster, often funded by a television licensing fee, and most of them later established a second or even third station providing a greater variety of content. Commercial television services also became available when private companies applied for television broadcasting licenses. Often, each new network would be identified with their channel number, so that individual stations would often be numbered \"One,\" \"Two,\" \"Three,\" and so forth.\n\nThe first television network in the United Kingdom was operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). On 2 November 1936 the BBC opened the world's first regular high-definition television service, from a 405 lines transmitter at Alexandra Palace. The BBC remained dominant until eventually on 22 September 1955, commercial broadcasting was established in order to create a second television network. Rather than creating a single network with local stations owned and operated by a single company (as is the case with the BBC), each local area had a separate television station that was independently owned and operated, although most of these stations shared a number of programmes, particularly during peak evening viewing hours. These stations formed the ITV network.\n\nWhen the advent of UHF broadcasting allowed a greater number of television stations to broadcast, the BBC launched a second network, BBC Two (with the original service being renamed BBC One). A fourth national commercial service was launched, Channel 4, although Wales instead introduced a Welsh-language service, S4C. These were later followed by the launch of a fifth network, Channel 5. Since the introduction of digital television, the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 each introduced a number of digital-only networks. Sky operates a large number of networks including Sky One, Sky Living and Sky Atlantic; as does UKTV, which operates networks like Dave, Gold, W and Yesterday.\n\nSweden had only one television network until the early-1990s: the public broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT). Commercial companies such as Modern Times Group, TV4, Viasat, and SBS Discovery have established TV networks since the 1980s although they initially aired exclusively on satellite. In 1991, TV4 became Sweden's first commercial television network to air terrestrially. Most television programming in Sweden is centralised except for local news updates that air on SVT2 and TV4.\n\nUntil 1989, Netherlands Public Broadcasting was the only television network in the Netherlands, with three stations, Nederland 1, Nederland 2 and Nederland 3. Rather than having a single production arm, there are a number of public broadcasting organizations that create programming for each of the three stations, each working relatively independently. Commercial broadcasting in the Netherlands is currently operated by two networks, RTL Nederland and SBS Broadcasting, which together broadcast seven commercial stations.\n\nThe first television network in the Soviet Union launched on 7 July 1938 when Petersburg – Channel 5 of Leningrad Television became a unionwide network.\nThe second television network in the Soviet Union launched on 22 March 1951 when Channel One of USSR Central Television became a unionwide network. Until 1989, there were six television networks, all owned by the USSR Gosteleradio. This changed during Mikhail Gorbachev's Perestroika program, when the first independent television network, 2×2, was launched.\n\nFollowing the breakup of the Soviet Union, USSR Gosteleradio ceased to exist as well as its six networks. Only Channel One had a smooth transition and survived as a network, becoming Ostankino Channel One. The other five networks were operated by Ground Zero. This free airwave space allowed many private television networks like NTV and TV-6 to launch in the mid-1990s.\n\nThe 2000s were marked by the increased state intervention in Russian television. On April 14, 2001 NTV experienced management changes following the expulsion of former oligarch and NTV founder Vladimir Gusinsky. As a result, most of the prominent reporters featured on NTV left the network. Later on January 22, 2002, the second largest private television network TV-6, where the former NTV staff took refuge, was shut down allegedly because of its editorial policy. Five months later on June 1, TVS was launched, mostly employing NTV/TV-6 staff, only to cease operations the following year. Since then, the four largest television networks (Channel One, Russia 1, NTV and Russia 2) have been state-owned.\n\nStill, the 2000s saw a rise of several independent television networks such as REN (its coverage increased vastly allowing it to become a federal network), Petersburg – Channel Five (overall the same), the relaunched 2×2. The Russian television market is mainly shared today by five major companies: Channel One, Russia 1, NTV, TNT and CTC.\n\nThe major commercial television network in Brazil is Rede Globo, which was founded in 1965. It grew to become the largest and most successful media conglomerate in the country, having a dominating presence in various forms of media including television, radio, print (newspapers and magazines) and the Internet.\n\nOther networks include Rede Bandeirantes, RecordTV, SBT, RedeTV!, and TV Cultura.\n\nAustralia has two national public networks, ABC Television and SBS. The ABC operates eight stations as part of its main network ABC, one for each state and territory, as well as three digital-only networks, ABC Kids / ABC Comedy, ABC Me and ABC News. SBS currently operates four stations, SBS, SBS Viceland, SBS Food and NITV.\n\nThe first commercial networks in Australia involved commercial stations that shared programming in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and later Perth, with each network forming networks based on their allocated channel numbers: TCN-9 in Sydney, GTV-9 in Melbourne, QTQ-9 in Brisbane, NWS-9 in Adelaide and STW-9 in Perth together formed the Nine Network; while their equivalents on VHF channels 7 and 10 respectively formed the Seven Network and Network Ten. Until 1989, areas outside these main cities had access to only a single commercial station, and these rural stations often formed small networks such as Prime Television. Beginning in 1989, however, television markets in rural areas began to aggregate, allowing these rural networks to broadcast over a larger area, often an entire state, and become full-time affiliates to one specific metropolitan network.\n\nAs well as these Free-to-air channels, there are other's on Australia's Pay television network Foxtel.\n\nNew Zealand has one public network, Television New Zealand (TVNZ), which consists of two main networks: TVNZ 1 is the network's flagship network which carries news, current affairs and sports programming as well as the majority of the locally produced shows broadcast by TVNZ and imported shows. TVNZ's second network, TV2, airs mostly imported shows with some locally produced programs such as \"Shortland Street\". TVNZ also operates a network exclusive to pay television services, TVNZ Heartland, available on providers such as Sky. TVNZ previously operated a non-commercial public service network, TVNZ 7, which ceased operations in June 2012 and was replaced by the timeshift channel TV One Plus 1. The network operated by Television New Zealand has progressed from operating as four distinct local stations within the four main centers in the 1960s, to having the majority of the content produced from TVNZ's Auckland studios at present.\n\nNew Zealand also has several privately owned television networks with the largest being operated by MediaWorks. MediaWorks' flagship network is TV3, which competes directly with both TVNZ broadcast networks. MediaWorks also operates a second network, FOUR, which airs mostly imported programmes with children's shows airing in the daytime and shows targeted at teenagers and adult between 15 and 39 years of age during prime time. MediaWorks also operates a timeshift network, TV3 + 1, and a 24-hour music network, C4.\n\nAll television networks in New Zealand air the same programming across the entire country with the only regional deviations being for local advertising; a regional news service existed in the 1980s, carrying a regional news programme from TVNZ's studios in New Zealand's four largest cities, Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin.\n\nIn the 1960s, the service operated at the time by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation was four separate television stations – AKTV2 in Auckland, WNTV1 in Wellington, CHTV3 in Christchurch and DNTV2 in Dunedin – which each ran their own newscast and produced some in-house programmes, with other shows being shared between the stations. Programmes and news footage were distributed via mail, with a programme airing in one region being mailed to another region for broadcast the following week. A network was finally established in 1969, with the same programmes being relayed to all regions simultaneously. From the 1970s to the 1990s, locally produced programmes that aired on TV One and TV2 were produced out of one of the four main studios, with TVNZ's network hub based in Wellington. Today, most locally produced programmes that are aired by both TVNZ and other networks are not actually produced in-house, instead they are often produced by a third party company (for example, the TV2 programme \"Shortland Street\" is produced by South Pacific Pictures). The networks produce their own news and current affairs programs, with most of the content filmed in Auckland.\n\nNew Zealand also operates several regional television stations, which are only available in individual markets. The regional stations will typically air a local news programme, produce some shows in-house and cover local sports events; the majority of programming on the regional stations will be imported from various sources.\n\nIn the Philippines, in practice, the terms \"network,\" \"station\" and \"channel\" are used interchangeably as programming lineups are mostly centrally planned from the networks' main offices, and since provincial/regional stations usually just relay the broadcast from their parent network's flagship station (usually based in the Mega Manila area). As such, networks made up of VHF stations are sometimes informally referred to by their over-the-air channel number in the Mega Manila area (for example, Channel 2 or \"Dos\" for ABS-CBN, Channel 5 or \"Singko\" for TV5, and Channel 7 or \"Siyete\" for GMA Network), while some incorporate their channel numbers in the network's name (for example, TV5, Studio 23 and Net 25, which respectively broadcast on VHF channel 5, and UHF channels 23 and 25).\n\nUnlike the United States, where networks receive programmes produced by various production companies, the two largest networks in the Philippines produce all of their prime time programmes except for Asianovelas. Other networks adopt block-time programming, which utilizes programming arrangements similar to the relationship between a U.S. network and station.\n\n"}
{"id": "48370461", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=48370461", "title": "Al Jazeera", "text": "Al Jazeera\n\nAl Jazeera (, , literally \"The Island\", though referring to the Arabian Peninsula in context) is a Qatari state-funded broadcaster in Doha, Qatar, owned by the Al Jazeera Media Network. Initially launched as an Arabic news and current-affairs satellite TV channel, Al Jazeera has since expanded into a network with several outlets, including the Internet and specialty television channels in multiple languages.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network is a major global news organization, with 80 bureaus around the world. The original Al Jazeera Arabic channel's willingness to broadcast dissenting views, for example on call-in shows, created controversies in the Arab States of the Persian Gulf. The station gained worldwide attention following the outbreak of the war in Afghanistan, when its office there was the only channel to cover the war live.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network is allegedly owned by the government of Qatar, though Al Jazeera claims otherwise. Al Jazeera Media Network has stated that they are editorially independent from the government of Qatar as the network is funded through loans and grants rather than government subsidies. Critics have accused Al Jazeera of being a propaganda outlet for the Qatari government. The network is sometimes perceived to have mainly Islamist perspectives, promoting the Muslim Brotherhood, and having a pro-Sunni and an anti-Shia bias in its reporting of regional issues. However, Al Jazeera insists it covers all sides of a debate; it says it presents Israel's view, Iran's view and even aired videos released by Osama bin Laden. In June 2017, the Saudi, Emirati, Bahraini, and Egyptian governments demanded the closure of the news station as one of thirteen demands made to Qatar during the 2017 Qatar Crisis. Other media networks have spoken out in support of the network. According to \"The Atlantic\" magazine, Al Jazeera presents a far more moderate, Westernized face than Islamic jihadism or rigid Sunni orthodoxy, and though the network has been criticized as \"an 'Islamist' stalking horse\" it actually features \"very little specifically religious content in its broadcasts\".\n\nIn Arabic, \"\" literally means \"the island\". However, it refers here to the Arabian Peninsula, which is , abbreviated to . (Compare the Arabic name () for Upper Mesopotamia, another area of land almost entirely surrounded by water.) Also Algeciras.\n\nAl Jazeera Satellite Channel, now known as AJA, was launched on 1 November 1996 following the closure of the BBC's Arabic language television station, a joint venture with Orbit Communications Company. The BBC channel had closed after a year and a half when the Saudi government attempted to suppress information, including a graphic report on executions and prominent dissident views.\n\nThe Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, provided a loan of QAR 500 million (US$137 million) to sustain Al Jazeera through its first five years, as Hugh Miles detailed in his book \"Al Jazeera: The Inside Story of the Arab News Channel That Is Challenging the West\". Shares were held by private investors as well as the Qatar government.\nAl Jazeera's first day on the air was 1 November 1996. It offered 6 hours of programming per day; increased to 12 hours by the end of 1997. It was broadcast to the immediate neighborhood as a terrestrial signal, and on cable, as well as through satellites (which was also free to users in the Arab world), although Qatar, and many other Arab countries, barred private individuals from having satellite dishes until 2001.\n\nAt the time of the Al Jazeera Media Network launch Arabsat was the only satellite broadcasting to the Middle East, and for the first year could only offer Al Jazeera a weak C-band transponder that needed a large satellite dish for reception. A more powerful K-band transponder became available as a peace-offering after its user, Canal France International, accidentally beamed 30 minutes of pornography into ultraconservative Saudi Arabia.\n\nAl Jazeera was not the first such broadcaster in the Middle East; a number had appeared since the Arabsat satellite, a Saudi Arabia-based venture of 21 Arab governments, took orbit in 1985. The unfolding of Operation Desert Storm on CNN International underscored the power of live television in current events. While other local broadcasters in the region would assiduously avoid material embarrassing to their home governments (Qatar had its own official TV station as well), Al Jazeera was pitched as an impartial news source and platform for discussing issues relating to the Arab world.\n\nIn presenting \"The opinion and the other opinion\" (the station's motto), it did not take long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking Hebrew on Arab television for the first time. Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called \"The Opposite Direction\", were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's terrestrial broadcast or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect.\n\nAl Jazeera was the only international news network to have correspondents in Iraq during the Operation Desert Fox bombing campaign in 1998. In a precursor of a pattern to follow, its exclusive video clips were highly prized by Western media.\n\n1 January 1999 was Al Jazeera's first day of 24-hour broadcasting. Employment had more than tripled in one year to 500 employees, and the agency had bureaux at a dozen sites as far as EU and Russia. Its annual budget was estimated at about $25 million at the time.\n\nHowever controversial, Al Jazeera was rapidly becoming one of the most influential news agencies in the whole region. Eager for news beyond the official versions of events, Arabs became dedicated viewers. A 2000 estimate pegged nightly viewership at 35 million, ranking Al Jazeera first in the Arab world, over the Saudi Arabia-sponsored Middle East Broadcasting Centre (MBC) and London's Arab News Network (ANN). There were about 70 satellite or terrestrial channels being broadcast to the Middle East, most of them in Arabic. Al Jazeera launched a free Arabic-language web site in January 2001. In addition, the TV feed was soon available in the United Kingdom for the first time via British Sky Broadcasting.\n\nAl Jazeera came to the attention of many in the West during the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the Taliban in Afghanistan after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the United States. It aired videos it received from Osama bin Laden and the Taliban, deeming new footage of the world's most wanted fugitives to be newsworthy. Some criticized the network for giving a voice to terrorists. Al Jazeera's Washington, D.C., bureau chief, Hafez al-Mirazi, compared the situation to that of the Unabomber's messages in \"The New York Times\". The network said it had been given the tapes because it had a large Arab audience.\n\nMany other TV networks were eager to acquire the same footage. CNN International had exclusive rights to it for six hours before other networks could broadcast, a provision that was broken by the others on at least one controversial occasion. Prime Minister Tony Blair soon appeared on an Al Jazeera talk show on 14 November 2001 to state Britain's case for pursuing the Taliban into Afghanistan.\n\nAl Jazeera's prominence rose during the war in Afghanistan because it had opened a bureau in Kabul before the war began. This gave it better access for videotaping events than other networks, which bought Al Jazeera's footage, sometimes for as much as $250,000.\n\nThe Kabul office was destroyed by United States bombs in 2001. Looking to stay ahead of possible future conflicts, Al Jazeera then opened bureaux in other troubled spots.\n\nThe network remained dependent on government support in 2002, with a budget of $40 million and ad revenues of about $8 million. It also took in fees for sharing its news feed with other networks. It had an estimated 45 million viewers around the world. Al Jazeera soon had to contend with a new rival, Al Arabiya, an offshoot of the Middle East Broadcasting Center, which was set up in nearby Dubai with Saudi financial backing.\n\nBefore and during the United States-led invasion of Iraq, where Al Jazeera had a presence since 1997, the network's facilities and footage were again highly sought by international networks. The channel and its web site also were seeing unprecedented attention from viewers looking for alternatives to embedded reporting and military press conferences.\n\nAl Jazeera moved its sports coverage to a new, separate channel on 1 November 2003, allowing for more news and public affairs programming on the original channel. An English language web site had launched earlier in March 2003. The channel had about 1,300 to 1,400 employees, its newsroom editor told The New York Times. There were 23 bureaux around the world and 70 foreign correspondents, with 450 journalists in all.\n\nOn 1 April 2003, a United States plane fired on Al Jazeera's Baghdad bureau, killing reporter Tareq Ayyoub. The attack was called a mistake; however, Qatar had supplied the US with a precise map of the location of the bureau in order to spare it from attack.\n\nAfshin Rattansi became the channel's first English-language broadcast journalist after he left the BBC Today Programme, after the death of UK government scientist David Kelly.\n\nThe closing of the \"Al Jazeera\" Media Network was one of the terms of diplomatic reestablishment put forward by Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt during the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis.\n\nOn 23 June 2017, the countries that cut ties to Qatar issued a list of demands to end the crisis, insisting that Qatar shut down the \"Al Jazeera\" network, close a Turkish military base and scale down ties with Iran. The call, included in a list of 13 points, read: \"Shut down Al Jazeera and its affiliate stations.\"\n\nAgencies, media outlets, journalists and media rights organisations have decried the demands to close \"Al Jazeera\" as attempts to curb press freedom, including Reporters Without Borders; CPJ; IFEX; The Guardian and the New York Times.\n\nEarlier, Saudi Arabia and the UAE blocked \"Al Jazeera\" websites; Saudi Arabia closed \"Al Jazeera\"'s bureau in Riyadh and halted its operating licence, accusing the network of promoting \"terrorist groups\" in the region; and Jordan also revoked the licence for \"Al Jazeera\".\n\nSaudi Arabia also banned hotels from airing \"Al Jazeera\", threatening fines of up to $26,000 for those violating the ban.\n\nOn 6 June, \"Al Jazeera\" was the victim of a cyber attack on all of its platforms.\n\nQatari Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, has said Doha will not discuss the status of \"Al Jazeera\" in any negotiations. \"Doha rejects discussing any matter related to \"Al Jazeera\" channel as it considers it an internal affair,\" Qatar News Agency quoted the foreign minister as saying. \"Decisions concerning the Qatari internal affairs are Qatari sovereignty - and no one has to interfere with them.\"\n\nIn June 2017, hacked emails from Yousef Al Otaiba (UAE ambassador to US) were reported as \"embarrassing\" by \"Al Jazeera\" because they showed links between the UAE and the US-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies. According to observers, the extensive media coverage of the alleged email hack was seen as a provocation and the hacking as a move orchestrated by Qatar.\n\nOn 24 November 2017 Dubai Police deputy chief Lieutenant General Dhahi Khalfan Tamim accused \"Al Jazeera\" for provoking the 2017 Sinai attack and called for bombing of \"Al Jazeera\" by the Saudi-led coalition, tweeting in Arabic \"The alliance must bomb the machine of terrorism ... the channel of ISIL, al-Qaeda and the al-Nusra front, Al Jazeera the terrorists\".\n\nIn 2018, \"Al Jazeera\" reported apparent new details regarding a 1996 Qatari coup d'état attempt accusing the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Egypt, of plotting to overthrow Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. According to \"Al Jazeera\", a former French army commander Paul Barril was contracted and supplied with weapons by the UAE to carry out the coup operation in Qatar. UAE minister of foreign affairs Anwar Gargash responded to the documentary and stated that Paul Barril was in fact a security agent of the Qatari Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al Thani who visited Abu Dhabi and had no relationship with the UAE and the documentary was a falsification attempt through a pay-rolled speaker to inculpate the UAE in the coup.\n\nAs of June 2019, the United Arab Emirates had paid the lobbying firm Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld $1.9m in the preceding year, principally concerning Qatar government-owned media. Lobbyists met with the FCC nine times and with 30 members of the House and Senate during the same time period. A spokesman for the chair of the Senate Finance Committee, Chuck Grassley, said that the committee had been \"reviewing Al Jazeera's activities\" prior to the UAE's lobbying effort.\n\nDuring this time the firm lobbied for Al Jazeera to be reclassified as a foreign agent as defined by the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which was simultaneously the focus of a Twitter campaign. On 20 September 2019, Twitter announced it had shut down two groups of accounts with links to UAE spreading disinformation primarily focused on Qatar. According to Bloomberg, the archive of the incriminated accounts tweets showed \"hundreds of messages attacking Al-Jazeera\".\n\nThe original Al Jazeera channel was launched 1 November 1996 by an emiri decree with a loan of 500 million Qatari riyals (US$137 million) from the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa. By securing its funding through loans or grants rather than direct government subsidies, the channel seeks to maintain independent editorial policy. The channel began broadcasting in late 1996, with many staff joining from the BBC World Service's Saudi-co-owned Arabic-language TV station, which had shut down on 1 April 1996 after two years of operation because of censorship demands by the Saudi Arabian government.\nThe Al Jazeera logo is a decorative representation of the network's name written using Arabic calligraphy. It was selected by the station's founder, Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa, as the winning entry in a design competition.\n\nAl Jazeera restructured its operations to form a network that contains all their different channels. Wadah Khanfar, the then managing director of the Arabic Channel, was appointed as the director general of Al Jazeera Media Network. He also acted as the managing director of the original Arabic Channel. Khanfar resigned on 20 September 2011 proclaiming that he had achieved his original goals, and that 8 years was enough time for any leader of an organization, in an interview aired on Al Jazeera English. Ahmed bin Jassim Al Thani replaced Khanfar and served as the director general of the channel from September 2011 to June 2013 when he was appointed minister of economy and trade. The chairman of the channel is Hamad bin Thamer Al Thani. The Director General and editor-in-chief of the Arabic website is Mostefa Souag, who replaced Ahmed Sheikh as editor-in-chief. It has more than 100 editorial staff. The managing director of Al Jazeera English is Al Anstey. Mohamed Nanabhay became editor-in-chief of the English-language site in 2009. Previous editors include Beat Witschi and Russell Merryman.\n\nProminent on-air personalities include Faisal al-Qassem, host of the talk show \"The Opposite Direction\", Ahmed Mansour, host of the show \"Without Borders (bi-la Hudud)\" and Sami Haddad.\n\nIts former Iran and Beirut Bureau Chief was Ghassan bin Jiddo. He became an influential figure on Al Jazeera with his program \"Hiwar Maftuh\", one of the most frequently watched programs. He also interviewed Nasrallah in 2007 and produced a documentary about Hezbollah. Some suggested that he would even replace Wadah Khanfar. Bin Jiddo resigned after political disagreements with the station.\n\nOssama AlBayati is an art director for film and television specialized in network branding. Ossama made several projects that received Promax Awards in Dubai, Los Angeles and Europe.\n\nMany governments in the Middle East deploy state-run media or government censorship to impact local media coverage and public opinion, leading to international objections regarding press freedom and biased media coverage. Some scholars and commentators use the notion of \"contextual objectivity\", which highlights the tension between objectivity and audience appeal, to describe the station's controversial yet popular news approach.\n\nIncreasingly, Al Jazeera Media Network's exclusive interviews and other footage are being rebroadcast in American, British, and other western media outlets such as CNN and the BBC. In January 2003, the BBC announced that it had signed an agreement with Al Jazeera for sharing facilities and information, including news footage.\n\nAl Jazeera's availability (via satellite) throughout the Middle East changed the television landscape of the region. Prior to the arrival of Al Jazeera, many Middle Eastern citizens were unable to watch TV channels other than state-controlled national TV stations. Al Jazeera introduced a level of freedom of speech on TV that was previously unheard of in many of these countries. Al Jazeera presented controversial views regarding the governments of many Arab states on the Persian Gulf, including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar; it also presented controversial views about Syria's relationship with Lebanon, and the Egyptian judiciary. Critics accused Al Jazeera Media Network of sensationalism in order to increase its audience share. Al Jazeera's broadcasts have sometimes resulted in drastic action: for example, when, on 27 January 1999, critics of the Algerian government appeared on the channel's live program \"El-Itidjah el-Mouakass\" (\"The Opposite Direction\"), the Algerian government cut the electricity supply to large parts of the capital Algiers (and allegedly also to large parts of the country) to prevent the program from being seen. By and large, however, Al Jazeera's popularity can be more substantively attributed to its in-depth coverage of issues considered to be of great importance to the international Arab population, many of which received minimal attention from other outlets, such as: the Palestinian perspective on the second Intifada, the experiences of Iraqis living through the Iraq war, and the exclusive broadcast of tapes produced by Osama Bin-Laden.\n\nAt the time of the aforementioned incident in Algeria, Al Jazeera Media Network was not yet generally known in the Western world, but where it was known, opinion was often favorable and Al Jazeera claimed to be the only politically independent television station in the Middle East. However, it was not until late 2001 that Al Jazeera achieved worldwide recognition, when it broadcast video statements by al-Qaeda leaders.\n\nSome observers have argued that Al Jazeera Media Network has formidable authority as an opinion-maker. Noah Bonsey and Jeb Koogler, for example, writing in the \"Columbia Journalism Review\", argue that the way in which the station covers any future Israeli-Palestinian peace deal could well determine whether or not that deal is actually accepted by the Palestinian public.\n\nThe channel's tremendous popularity has also, for better or worse, made it a shaper of public opinion. Its coverage often determines what becomes a story and what does not, as well as how Arab viewers think about issues. Whether in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, or Syria, the stories highlighted and the criticisms aired by guests on Al Jazeera's news programs have often significantly affected the course of events in the region.\n\nIn Palestine, the station's influence is particularly strong. Recent polling indicates that in the West Bank and Gaza, Al Jazeera is the primary news source for an astounding 53.4 percent of Palestinian viewers. The second and third most watched channels, Palestine TV and Al Arabiya, poll a distant 12.8 percent and 10 percent, respectively. The result of Al Jazeera's market dominance is that it has itself become a mover and shaker in Palestinian politics, helping to craft public perceptions and influence the debate. This has obvious implications for the peace process: how Al Jazeera covers the deliberations and the outcome of any negotiated agreement with Israel will fundamentally shape how it is viewed—and, more importantly, whether it is accepted—by the Palestinian public.\n\nAl Jazeera's broad availability in the Arab world \"operat[ing] with less constraint than almost any other Arab outlet, and remain[ing] the most popular channel in the region\", has been perceived as playing a part in the Arab Spring, including the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions. The \"New York Times\" stated in January 2011: \"The protests rocking the Arab world this week have one thread uniting them: Al Jazeera, ... whose aggressive coverage has helped propel insurgent emotions from one capital to the next.\" The newspaper quoted Marc Lynch, a professor of Middle East Studies at George Washington University: \"They did not cause these events, but it's almost impossible to imagine all this happening without Al Jazeera.\"\n\nWith Al Jazeera's growing global outreach and influence, some scholars including Adel Iskandar have described the station as a transformation of the very definition of \"alternative media.\" Al Jazeera presents a new direction in the discourse of global news flow and shows voices underrepresented by traditional mainstream media regardless of global imbalances in the flow of information.\n\nIn 2011 Al Jazeera Media Network launched Al Jazeera Balkans based in Sarajevo and serving Bosnia and Herzegovina in Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian. The look and feel of the network is similar to Al Jazeera English.\n\nAl Jazeera launched a Turkish-language news website in 2014; it was shut down on 3 May 2017.\n\nIn 2003 Al Jazeera hired its first English-language journalists, among whom was Afshin Rattansi, from the BBC's Today Programme.\n\nIn March 2003 it launched an English-language website.\n\nOn 4 July 2005 Al Jazeera officially announced plans to launch a new English-language satellite service to be called Al Jazeera International.\nThe new channel started at 12h GMT on 15 November 2006 under the name Al Jazeera English and has broadcast centers in Doha (next to the original Al Jazeera headquarters and broadcast center), London, Kuala Lumpur and Washington D.C. The channel is a 24-hour, 7-days-a-week news channel, with 12 hours broadcast from Doha, and four hours each from London, Kuala Lumpur, and Washington D.C.\n\nAl Jazeera launched an English language channel, originally called Al Jazeera International, in 2006. Among its staff were journalists hired from ABC's Nightline and other top news outfits. Josh Rushing, a former media handler for CENTCOM during the Iraq war, agreed to provide commentary; David Frost was also on board. In an interesting technical feat, the broadcast of the new operation was handed off between bases in Doha, London, Washington, D.C., and Kuala Lumpur on a daily cycle.\n\nThe new English language venture faced considerable regulatory and commercial hurdles in the North America market for its perceived sympathy with extremist causes. At the same time, others felt Al Jazeera's competitive advantage lay in programming in the Arabic language. There were hundreds of millions of potential viewers among the non-Arabic language speaking Muslims in Europe and Asia, however, and many others who might be interested in seeing news from the Middle East read by local voices. If the venture panned out, it would extend the influence of Al Jazeera, and tiny Qatar, beyond even what had been achieved in the station's first decade. In an interesting twist of fate, the BBC World Service was preparing to launch its own Arabic language station in 2007. Today, evidence of U.S. antipathy at the Arabic network has dissipated significantly, though not entirely, several analysts say.\n\nIn January 2013, Al Jazeera Media Network purchased Current TV, which was partially owned by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore. Using part of Current TV's infrastructure, Al Jazeera launched an American news channel on 20 August 2013.\n\nThough Current TV had large distribution throughout the United States on cable and satellite television, it averaged only 28,000 viewers at any time. The acquisition of Current TV by Al Jazeera allowed Time Warner Cable to drop the network due to its low ratings, but they released a statement saying that they would consider carrying the channel after they evaluated whether it made sense for their customers. Time Warner Cable later began carrying Al Jazeera America in December 2013.\n\nIn August 2014 Gore and fellow shareholder Joel Hyatt launched a lawsuit against Al Jazeera claiming a residual payment of $65 million of the sale proceeds, due in 2014, remained unpaid. Al Jazeera later announced a countersuit. In 2016, the case was settled outside of court on the basis of a mutual agreement, under which: Gore and Hyatt had their claims waived, Al Jazeera was ordered to pay the $2.35 million in legal fees incurred by the plaintiffs, and the network forfeited its rights to pursue any indemnification claims related to the ordeal.\n\nOn 13 January 2016, Al Jazeera America CEO Al Anstey announced that the network would cease operations on 12 April 2016, citing the \"economic landscape\".\n\nbeIN SPORTS, formerly Al Jazeera Sport channels, was legally separated from Al Jazeera Media Network on 1 January 2014 and is now controlled by beIN Media Group.\n\nbeIN SPORTS currently operates three channels in France – beIN Sport 1, beIN Sport 2 and beIN Sport MAX – and launched two channels in the United States (English and Spanish) in August 2012. The network also has a Canadian Channel and holds Canadian broadcast rights to several sports properties, The network also has an Australian channel.\n\nbeIN Sport holds the rights to broadcast major football tournaments on French television, including Ligue 1, Bundesliga, the UEFA Champions League and the European Football Championships. In the United States and Canada, beIN Sport holds the rights to broadcast La Liga, Serie A, Ligue 1, Copa del Rey, South American World Cup Qualifier and English Championship matches, in addition to Barca TV.\n\nIn October 2009 Al Jazeera acquired six sports channels of the ART. On 26 November 2009 Al Jazeera English received approval from the CRTC, which enables Al Jazeera English to broadcast via satellite in Canada.\n\nThe original Al Jazeera channel is available worldwide through various satellite and cable systems. For availability info of the Al Jazeera network's other TV channels, see their respective articles. Segments of Al Jazeera English are uploaded to YouTube.\n\nEurope, Northern Africa and the Middle East. Al Jazeera can be freely viewed with a DVB-S receiver in Europe, Northern Africa and the Middle East as it is broadcast on the Astra 1M, Eutelsat Hot Bird 13A, Eutelsat 10A, Badr 4, Turksat 2A, Thor 6, Nilesat 102, Hispasat 1C and Eutelsat 28A satellites. The Optus C1 satellite in Australia carries the channel for free and from July 2012 is available at no extra charge to all subscribers to Australia's Foxtel pay-TV service.\n\nCanada. Al Jazeera is available in Canada on Bell Channel 516, as part of the package \"International News I.\" Al Jazeera is available on Rogers Cable individually. Al Jazeera is also available on Shaw Cable TV Channel 513, as part of the package \"Multicultural\"\n\nIndia. On 7 December 2010, Al Jazeera said its English language service has got a downlink license to broadcast in India. Satellite and cable companies would therefore be allowed to broadcast Al Jazeera in the country. The broadcaster will be launched soon on Dish TV, and is considering a Hindi-language channel.\n\nUnited Kingdom. Al Jazeera English is available on the Sky and Freesat satellite platforms, as well as the standard terrestrial service (branded Freeview), thus making it available to the vast majority of UK households. On 26 November 2013 it launched a HD simulcast on certain terrestrial transmitters.\n\nUnited States. Al Jazeera English is mainly available online via its live stream on its website, DVB-S, Galaxy 19 and Galaxy 23 C-band satellites. Following the launch of Al Jazeera America in 2013 until 2016 when the channel folded, Al Jazeera English was not available in the United States. It had been available through live streaming over the Al Jazeera website, DVB-S, Galaxy 19, free to air and Galaxy 23 satellites, and it had been broadcast over the air in the Washington, DC DMA by WNVC on digital channel 30-5, and on digital channel 48.2 in the New York metro area, but those broadcasts were discontinued on 20 August 2013. Al Jazeera English had also been available to cable TV viewers in Toledo, Ohio, Burlington, Vermont, New York City (WRNN rebroadcast), Washington State, and Washington, D.C (a rebroadcast of WNVC's feed), but those sources were switched to Al Jazeera America on 20 August 2013. Many analysts had considered the limited availability of Al Jazeera English in the United States to be effectively a \"blackout\". The live stream and programming over the internet that had been geoblocked was made available to viewers in the United States again in September 2016.\n\nOnline. Al Jazeera English can be viewed over the Internet from their official website. The low-resolution version is available free of charge to users of computers and video streaming boxes, and the high-resolution version is available under subscription fees through partner sites. Al Jazeera's English division has also partnered with Livestation for Internet-based broadcasting. This enables Al Jazeera English and Al Jazeera live to be watched worldwide.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network's web-based service is accessible subscription-free throughout the world, at a variety of websites. The station launched an English-language edition of its online content in March 2003. This English language website was relaunched on 15 November 2006, along with the launch of Al Jazeera English. The English and Arabic sections are editorially distinct, with their own selection of news and comment. Al Jazeera and Al Jazeera English are streamed live on the official site, as well as on YouTube. On 13 April 2009 Al Jazeera launched versions of its English and Arabic sites suitable for mobile devices.\n\nThe Arabic version of the site was brought offline for about 10 hours by an FBI raid on its ISP, InfoCom Corporation, on 5 September 2001. InfoCom was later convicted of exporting to Syria and Gaddafi-ruled Libya, of knowingly being invested in by a Hamas member (both of which are illegal in the United States), and of underpaying customs duties.\n\nin 2014 Al Jazeera Media Network launched an online only channel called AJ+. The channel is based out of the former Current TV studios in San Francisco and has outposts in Doha, Kuala Lumpur and other locations. It is independent of all of Al Jazeera's other channels and is mostly in an on demand format. The channel launched on 13 June 2014 on with a preview on YouTube. This was followed in 2017 by the launch of Jetty, a podcast network which is also based out of the former Current TV studios in San Francisco.\n\nAl Jazeera recently launched a Mandarin-language news website. It is the first Arabic news provider to target the Chinese audience. The staff of the project will be in contact with their audience via Chinese social media like Weibo, Meipai and WeChat.\n\nOn 13 January 2009 Al Jazeera Media Network released some of its broadcast quality footage from Gaza under a Creative Commons license. Contrary to business \"All Rights Reserved\" standards, the license invites third parties, including rival broadcasters, to reuse and remix the footage, so long as Al Jazeera is credited. The videos are hosted on blip.tv, which allows easy downloading and integration with Miro.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network also offers over 2,000 Creative Commons-licensed still photos at their Flickr account.\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network accepts user-submitted photos and videos about news events through a Your Media page, and this content may be featured on the website or in broadcasts.\n\nThe channel used the Ushahidi platform to collect information and reports about the Gaza War, through Twitter, SMS and the website.\n\nFuture projects in other languages include Al Jazeera Urdu, an Urdu language channel to cater mainly to Pakistanis. A Kiswahili service called Al Jazeera Kiswahili was to be based in Nairobi and broadcast in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. However, those plans were cancelled due to budget constraints.\n\nThe channel also has plans to launch a Spanish-language news network to cater mainly to Spain and Hispanic America, like the Iranian cable TV network HispanTV. Al Jazeera has also been reported to be planning to launch an international newspaper. Al Jazeera Arabic began using a chroma key studio on 13 September 2009. Similar to Sky News, Al Jazeera broadcast from that studio while the channel's main newsroom was given a new look. The channel relaunched, with new graphics and music along with a new studio, on 1 November 2009, the 13th birthday of the channel.\n\nWhile Al Jazeera has a large audience in the Middle East, the organization and the original Arabic channel in particular have been criticised and involved in a number of controversies.\nIn May 2000 Bahrain banned Al Jazeera's broadcasts due to the channel's comments about Bahrain's municipal elections, labelling it as \"serving Zionism\".\n\nSeveral Al Jazeera staff were killed by U.S. military \"friendly-fire\" incidents.\nThe United-States-controlled Iraqi interim government closed the offices of Al Jazeera in Baghdad in August 2004 during the United States occupation on Iraq. The interim Iraqi prime minister Iyad Allawi then accused the channel of \"inciting hatred\" in the country. At the end of April 2013, the Iraqi government led by Nouri Al Maliki once again ordered Al Jazeera to stop broadcasting due to the alleged role of the channel in \"encouraging the sectarian unrest\". In response to the restrictions imposed by Al Maliki, Al Jazeera issued a statement in which the organization expressed its astonishment at the development, and reiterated their assertion, \"We cover all sides of the stories in Iraq, and have done for many years.\" The network further objected to the ban, saying, \"The fact that so many channels have been hit all at once though suggests this is an indiscriminate decision. We urge the authorities to uphold freedom for the media to report the important stories taking place in Iraq.\"\n\nIn 2019, congressman Jack Bergman wrote in the \"Washington Examiner\" that \"Al Jazeera’s record of radical anti-American, anti-Semitic, and anti-Israel broadcasts warrants scrutiny from regulators to determine whether this network is in violation of US law\".\n\nDuring the 2011 Egyptian protests, on 30 January the Egyptian government ordered the TV channel to close its offices. The next day Egyptian security forces arrested six Al Jazeera journalists for several hours and seized their camera equipment. There were also reports of disruption in Al Jazeera Mubasher's Broadcast to Egypt. The channel was also criticized for being sympathetic to Mohamed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood and former IAEA director Mohammed ElBaradei. It was closed for the same reasons in September 2013.\nTwenty-two members of staff of Al Jazeera's Egyptian bureau announced their resignation on 8 July 2013, citing biased coverage of the ongoing Egyptian power redistribution in favour of the Muslim Brotherhood. Al Jazeera says that the resignations were due to pressure from the Egyptian military.\n\nAl Jazeera has been criticized over unfair coverage of the Syrian civil war. The channel's reporting has been described as largely supportive of the rebels, while demonizing the Syrian government. The Lebanese newspaper \"As-Safir\" cited outtakes of interviews showing that the channel's staff coached Syrian eyewitnesses and fabricated reports of oppression by Syria's government. In January 2013, a former Al Jazeera employee from Syria stated their belief that there was ongoing strong pressure to conform to biased coverage of the Syrian civil war. However, according to Pew Research Center study, in its coverage of the Syrian crisis, Al Jazeera America cable news channel provided viewers with content that often resembles what Americans saw on other U.S. cable news outlets.\n\nThe Indian government banned the Al Jazeera TV channel in April 2015 for five telecast days as it repeatedly displayed disputed maps of India. The suspension concerns maps of Pakistan used in 2013 and 2014 that did not demarcate the part of Kashmir under Pakistani control (Pakistan-administered Kashmir) as a separate territory. Once notified by Indian authorities, the channel said it ensured all maps from 22 September 2014, onward used dotted lines and unique shading for the disputed portions.\n\nOn 19 July 2008, Al Jazeera TV broadcast a program from Lebanon which covered the \"welcome-home\" festivities for Samir Kuntar, a Lebanese citizen who had been imprisoned in Israel for killing four people in a Palestine Liberation Front raid from Lebanon into Israel. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, praised Kuntar as a \"pan-Arab hero\" and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) announced a boycott of the channel, which was to include a general refusal by Israeli officials to be interviewed by the station, and a ban on its correspondents from entering government offices in Jerusalem. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera's director general, Wadah Khanfar, in which he admitted that the program violated the station's Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel's programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur.\n\nOn 15 March 2010, Channel Ten (Israel) broadcast a video story about the Coastal Road massacre on 11 March 1978, with two photographs of a victim and a terrorist, both women, with Al Jazeera's logo. Photographer Shmuel Rahmani, who took these photos, made a lawsuit against Al Jazeera in the Jerusalem District Court. On 19 February 2014, the court ruled that Al Jazeera would pay 73,500 ILS to Rahmani. On 23 November 2017, a second verdict of 30,000 ILS against Al Jazeera was made in the Nazareth District Court. At the end of 2017, a third lawsuit was brought by Michel Ganoe, an American Christian who has lived in Israel, in the Tel Aviv District Court, after his video of volunteering for the Israel Defense Forces was compared by Al Jazeera to volunteering for the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. On 15 November 2018, Ganoe won 96,199 ILS from Al Jazeera.\n\nImmediately after its launch in 2003, the English site was attacked by one or several hackers, who launched denial-of-service attacks, and another hacker who redirected visitors to a site featuring an American flag. Both events were widely reported as Al Jazeera's website having been attacked by \"hackers\". In November 2003, John William Racine II, also known as 'John Buffo', was sentenced to 1,000 hours of community service and a $1,500 U.S. fine for the online disruption. Racine posed as an Al Jazeera employee to get a password to the network's site, then redirected visitors to a page he created that showed an American flag shaped like a U.S. map and a patriotic motto, court documents said. In June 2003, Racine pleaded guilty to wire fraud and unlawful interception of an electronic communication. As of 2012, the perpetrators of the denial-of-service attacks remain unknown.\n\n\"Shariah and Life\" (\"al-Sharīʿa wa al-Ḥayāh\") is an Al Jazeera Arabic show with an estimated audience of 60 million worldwide and stars Muslim preacher Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is described as \"Islam's Spiritual 'Dear Abby'\". The format of Sharia and Life is similar to that of al-Qaradawi's earlier programing on Qatar TV as well as Egyptian television shows going as far back as the 1960s. Programs interpreting the Quran or dealing with religious issues were popular from Morocco to Saudi Arabia. The now defunct show has been the repeated subject of controversy. In January 2009, Qaradawi stated: \"Throughout history, Allah has imposed upon the [Jews] people who would punish them for their corruption. The last punishment was carried out by [Adolf] Hitler.\" In October 2010, Qaradawi was asked if Muslims should acquire nuclear weapons \"to terrorize their enemies.\" Qaradawi said he was pleased Pakistan had such a weapon, that the goal of nuclear weapons would be permissible, and provided religious justification quoting Koranic verses urging Muslims \"to terrorize thereby the enemy of God and your enemy.\"\n\nAl Jazeera Media Network is owned by the government of Qatar. While Al Jazeera has stated that they are editorially independent from the government of Qatar, this assertion has been disputed.\n\nIn 2010 United States Department of State internal communications, released by WikiLeaks as part of the 2010 diplomatic cables leak, said that the Qatar government manipulates Al Jazeera coverage to suit political interests.\n\nIn September 2012 \"The Guardian\" reported that Al Jazeera's editorial independence came into question when the channel's director of news, Salah Negm, stepped in at the last minute to order that a two-minute video covering a UN debate over the Syrian civil war include a speech by the leader of Qatar, Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Staff members protested that the speech was not the most important aspect of the debate, and that it was a repetition of previous calls for Arab intervention. \"The Guardian\" also said in September 2012 that Qatar had taken steps in recent years to consolidate control of Al Jazeera English.\n\nA 13 August 2015 article in \"The Independent\" on poor BBC news reporting also made reference to the political bias in Al Jazeera from the Qatar government.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "62027", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62027", "title": "American Broadcasting Company", "text": "American Broadcasting Company\n\nThe American Broadcasting Company (ABC) is an American commercial broadcast radio and television network owned by the Disney Media Networks division of The Walt Disney Company. The network is headquartered in Burbank, California, on Riverside Drive, directly across the street from Walt Disney Studios and adjacent to the Roy E. Disney Animation Building. The network's secondary offices, and headquarters of its news division, is in New York City, at their broadcast center at 77 West 66th Street in the Upper West Side of Manhattan.\n\nSince 2007, when ABC Radio (also known as Cumulus Media Networks) was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. The fifth-oldest major broadcasting network in the world and the youngest of the Big Three television networks, ABC is nicknamed \"The Alphabet Network\", as its initialism also represents the first three letters of the English alphabet, in order.\n\nABC launched as a radio network on October 12, 1943, serving as the successor to the NBC Blue Network, which had been purchased by Edward J. Noble. It extended its operations to television in 1948, following in the footsteps of established broadcast networks CBS and NBC. In the mid-1950s, ABC merged with United Paramount Theatres, a chain of movie theaters that formerly operated as a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. Leonard Goldenson, who had been the head of UPT, made the new television network profitable by helping develop and greenlight many successful series. In the 1980s, after purchasing an 80 percent interest in cable sports channel ESPN, the network's corporate parent, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc., merged with Capital Cities Communications, owner of several print publications, and television and radio stations. In 1996, most of Capital Cities/ABC's assets were purchased by The Walt Disney Company.\nThe television network has eight owned-and-operated and over 232 affiliated television stations throughout the United States and its territories. Some ABC-affiliated stations can also be seen in Canada via pay-television providers, and certain other affiliates can also be received over-the-air in areas near the Canada–United States border. ABC News provides news and features content for select radio stations owned by Cumulus Media, as these stations are former ABC Radio properties.\n\nIn the 1930s, radio in the United States was dominated by three companies: the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS), the Mutual Broadcasting System, and the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). The last was owned by electronics manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA), which owned two radio networks that each ran different varieties of programming, NBC Blue and NBC Red. The NBC Blue Network was created in 1927 for the primary purpose of testing new programs on markets of lesser importance than those served by NBC Red, which served the major cities, and to test drama series.\n\nIn 1934, Mutual filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regarding its difficulties in establishing new stations, in a radio market that was already being saturated by NBC and CBS. In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the practices of radio networks and published its report on the broadcasting of network radio programs in 1940. The report recommended that RCA give up control of either NBC Red or NBC Blue. At that time, the NBC Red Network was the principal radio network in the United States and, according to the FCC, RCA was using NBC Blue to eliminate any hint of competition. Having no power over the networks themselves, the FCC established a regulation forbidding licenses to be issued for radio stations if they were affiliated with a network which already owned multiple networks that provided content of public interest.\nOnce Mutual's appeals against the FCC were rejected, RCA decided to sell NBC Blue in 1941, and gave the mandate to do so to Mark Woods. RCA converted the NBC Blue Network into an independent subsidiary, formally divorcing the operations of NBC Red and NBC Blue on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either \"Blue\" or \"Blue Network\". The newly separated NBC Red and NBC Blue divided their respective corporate assets. Between 1942 and 1943, Woods offered to sell the entire NBC Blue Network, a package that included leases on landlines, three pending television licenses (WJZ-TV in New York City, KGO-TV in San Francisco and WENR-TV in Chicago), 60 affiliates, four operations facilities (in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C.), contracts with actors, and the brand associated with the Blue Network. Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. offered $7.5 million to purchase the network, but the offer was rejected by Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.\n\nEdward J. Noble, the owner of Life Savers candy, drugstore chain Rexall and New York City radio station WMCA, purchased the network for $8 million. Due to FCC ownership rules, the transaction, which was to include the purchase of three RCA stations by Noble, would require him to resell his station with the FCC's approval. The Commission authorized the transaction on October 12, 1943. Soon afterward, the Blue Network was purchased by the new company Noble founded, the American Broadcasting System. Noble subsequently acquired the rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944; its parent company adopted the corporate name \"American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.\" Woods retained his position as president and CEO of ABC until December 1949, and was subsequently promoted to vice-chairman of the board before leaving ABC altogether on June 30, 1951.\n\nMeanwhile, in August 1944, the West Coast division of the Blue Network, which owned San Francisco radio station KGO, bought Los Angeles station KECA from Earle C. Anthony for $800,000. Both stations were then managed by Don Searle, the vice-president of the Blue Network's West Coast division.\n\nThe ABC Radio Network created its audience slowly. The network acquired Detroit radio station WXYZ from KingTrendle Broadcasting in 1946 for a little less than $3 million (the station remained under ABC ownership until 1984).\n\nABC became an aggressive competitor to NBC and CBS when continuing NBC Blue's traditions of public service, it aired symphony performances conducted by Paul Whiteman, performances from the Metropolitan Opera, and jazz concerts aired as part of its broadcast of \"The Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street\" announced by Milton Cross. The network also became known for such suspenseful dramas as \"Sherlock Holmes\", \"Gang Busters\" and \"Counterspy\", as well as several mid-afternoon youth-oriented programs. However, ABC made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming, with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of NBC and CBS, adopting the use of the Magnetophon tape recorder, brought to the U.S. from Nazi Germany after its conquest, to pre-record its programming. With the help of the Magnetophon, ABC was able to provide its stars with greater freedom in terms of time, and also attract several big names, such as Bing Crosby at a time when NBC and CBS did not allow pre-taped shows.\n\nWhile its radio network was undergoing reconstruction, ABC found it difficult to avoid falling behind on the new medium of television. To ensure a space, in 1947, ABC submitted five applications for television station licenses, one for each market where it owned and operated a radio station (New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, San Francisco and Detroit). These applications all requested for the stations to broadcast on VHF channel 7, as Frank Marx, then ABC's vice-president of engineering, thought that the low-band VHF frequencies (corresponding to channels 2 through 6) would be requisitioned from broadcasting use and reallocated for the U.S. Army.\n\nThe ABC television network made its debut on April 19, 1948, with WFIL-TV in Philadelphia (now WPVI-TV) becoming its first primary affiliate. The first program ever broadcast on the network was \"On the Corner\", featuring satirist Henry Morgan. Other stations carrying the initial broadcast were WMAR-TV in Baltimore, WMAL-TV in Washington, D.C., and WABD, the DuMont station in New York City, since ABC's New York station had yet to sign on.\n\nThe network's flagship owned-and-operated station, WJZ-TV in New York City (later re-called WABC-TV), signed on the air on August 10, 1948, with its first broadcast running for two hours that evening. ABC's other owned-and-operated stations launched over the course of the next 13 months: WENR-TV in Chicago signed on the air on September 17, while WXYZ-TV in Detroit went on the air on October 9, 1948. In October 1948, as a result of an influx of television station license applications that it had issued as well as a study it undertook on the use of the VHF spectrum for broadcasting purposes, the FCC implemented a freeze on new station applications. However, KGO-TV in San Francisco, which had received its license prior to the freeze, made its debut on May 5, 1949. On May 7, 1949, \"Billboard\" revealed that ABC had proposed an investment of $6.25 million, of which it would spend $2.5 million to convert of land in Hollywood into what would become The Prospect Studios, and construct a transmitter on Mount Wilson, in anticipation of the launch of KECA-TV, which was scheduled to begin operations on August 1 (but would not actually sign on until September 16).\n\nIn the fall of 1949, ABC found itself in the position of an outsider, with less coverage than two of its competing networks, CBS and NBC, even though it was on par with them in some major cities and had a headstart over its third rival at the time, the DuMont Television Network. On November 3, 1949, \"The Ruggles\" starring Charlie Ruggles debuted, becoming the first family sitcom on the fledgling ABC network.\n\nBefore the freeze ended in 1952, there were only 108 existing television stations in the United States; a few major cities (such as Boston) had only two television stations, many other cities (such as Pittsburgh and St. Louis) had only one, and still many others (such as Denver and Portland) did not yet have any television service. The result was an uneven transition period where television flourished in certain areas and network radio remained the sole source of broadcast entertainment and news in others.\n\nAt the end of 1949, movie theater operator United Paramount Theatres (UPT) was forced by the U.S. Supreme Court to become an independent entity, separating itself from Paramount Pictures. For its part, ABC was on the verge of bankruptcy, with only five owned-and-operated stations and nine full-time affiliates. Its revenues, which were related to advertising and were indexed compared to the number of listeners/viewers, failed to compensate for its heavy investments in purchasing and building stations. In 1951, a rumor even mentioned that the network would be sold to CBS. In 1951, Noble held a 58% ownership stake in ABC, giving him $5 million with which to prevent ABC from going bankrupt; as banks refused further credit, that amount was obtained through a loan from the Prudential Insurance Company of America.\n\nLeonard Goldenson, the president of UPT (which sought to diversify itself at the time), approached Noble in 1951 on a proposal for UPT to purchase ABC. Noble received other offers, including one from CBS founder William S. Paley; however, a merger with CBS would have forced that network to sell its New York City and Los Angeles stations at the very least. Goldenson and Noble reached a tentative agreement in the late spring of 1951 in which UPT would acquire ABC and turn it into a subsidiary of the company that would retain autonomy in its management. On June 6, 1951, the tentative agreement was approved by UPT's board of directors. However, the transaction had to be approved by the FCC because of the presence of television networks and the recent separation between Paramount and UPT. Insofar as Paramount Pictures was already a shareholder in the DuMont Television Network, the FCC conducted a series of hearings to ensure whether Paramount was truly separated from United Paramount Theatres, and whether it was violating antitrust laws.\n\nIn 1952, when the release of the FCC's Sixth Report and Order announced the end of its freeze on new station license applications, among the issues the Commission was slated to address was whether to approve the UPT-ABC merger. One FCC Commissioner saw the possibility of ABC, funded by UPT, becoming a viable and competitive third television network. On February 9, 1953, the FCC approved UPT's purchase of ABC in exchange for $25 million in shares. The merged company, renamed American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, Inc. and headquartered in the Paramount Building at 1501 Broadway in Manhattan, owned six AM and several FM radio stations, five television stations and 644 cinemas in 300 U.S. cities. To comply with FCC ownership restrictions in effect at the time that barred common ownership of two television stations in the same market, UPT sold its Chicago television station, WBKB-TV, to CBS (which subsequently changed the station's call letters to WBBM-TV) for $6 million, while it kept ABC's existing Chicago station, WENR-TV. The merged company acquired the WBKB call letters for channel 7, which would eventually become WLS-TV. Goldenson began to sell some of the older theaters to help finance the new television network.\n\nOn March 1, 1953, ABC's New York City flagship stations – WJZ, WJZ-FM and WJZ-TV – changed their respective callsigns to WABC, WABC-FM and WABC-TV, and moved their operations to facilities at 7 West 66th Street, one block away from Central Park. The WABC call letters were previously used by the flagship station of CBS Radio (now WCBS (AM)) until 1946. The WJZ calls would later be reassigned to the then-ABC affiliate in Baltimore in 1959, in an historical nod to the fact that WJZ was originally established by the Baltimore station's owner at the time, Westinghouse.\n\nHowever, a problem emerged regarding the directions taken by ABC and UPT. In 1950, Noble appointed Robert Kintner to be ABC's president while he himself served as its CEO, a position he would hold until his death in 1958. Despite the promise of non-interference between ABC and UPT, Goldenson had to intervene in ABC's decisions because of financial problems and the FCC's long period of indecision. Goldenson added to the confusion when, in October 1954, he proposed a merger between UPT and the DuMont Television Network, which was also mired in financial trouble. As part of this merger, the network would have been renamed \"ABC-DuMont\" for five years, and DuMont would have received $5 million in cash, room on the schedule for existing DuMont programming, and guaranteed advertising time for DuMont Laboratories receivers. In addition, to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, it would have been required to sell either WABC-TV or DuMont owned-and-operated station WABD in the New York City market, as well as two other stations. The merged ABC-DuMont would have had the resources to compete with CBS and NBC.\n\nGoldenson sought to develop the ABC television network by trying to convince local stations to agree to affiliate with the network. In doing this, he contacted local entrepreneurs who owned television stations themselves, many of whom had previously invested in Paramount cinemas and had worked with him when he undertook the responsibility of restructuring United Paramount Theatres.\n\nAt the same time he made attempts to help grow ABC, Goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in Hollywood, with whom he had worked when UPT was a subsidiary of Paramount Pictures. ABC's merger with UPT led to the creation of relationships with Hollywood's film production studios, breaking a quarantine that had existed at that time between film and television, the latter of which had previously been more connected to radio. ABC's flagship productions at the time were \"The Lone Ranger\", based on the radio program of the same title, and \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\", the latter of which (at 14 seasons, running from 1952 to 1966) held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in U.S. television history, until it was surpassed by \"The Simpsons\" in 2003.\n\nGoldenson's efforts paid off, and on October 27, 1954, the network launched a campaign ushering in the \"New ABC\", with productions from several studios, including Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox.\n\nWarner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as ABC television series, and showcase these adaptations as part of the wheel series \"Warner Bros. Presents\". Airing during the 1955–56 season, it showcased television adaptations of the 1942 films \"Kings Row\" and \"Casablanca\"; \"Cheyenne\" (adapted from the 1947 film \"Wyoming Kid\"); \"Sugarfoot\" (a remake of the 1954 film \"The Boy from Oklahoma\"); and \"Maverick\". However, the most iconic of ABC's relationships with Hollywood producers was its agreement with Walt Disney; after the start of the network's bond with the Disney studio, James Lewis Baughman, who worked as a columnist at that time, observed that \"at ABC's headquarters in New York, the secretaries [were now] wearing hats with Mickey Mouse ears\".\n\nWalt Disney and his brother Roy contacted Goldenson at the end of 1953 for ABC to agree to finance part of the Disneyland project in exchange for producing a television program for the network. Walt wanted ABC to invest $500,000 and accrued a guarantee of $4.5 million in additional loans, a third of the budget intended for the park. Around 1954, ABC agreed to finance Disneyland in exchange for the right to broadcast a new Wednesday night program, \"Disneyland\", which debuted on the network on October 27, 1954 as the first of many anthology television programs that Disney would broadcast on all three networks over the course of the next 50 years.\n\nWhen Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, ABC aired a special live broadcast commemorating the park's first day of operation, \"Dateline: Disneyland\". Shortly thereafter, on October 3, 1955, a second regularly scheduled program produced by Disney made its debut, \"The Mickey Mouse Club\", a children's program that aired Monday through Friday afternoons, which starred a group of 24 children known as the \"Mouseketeers\". The two Disney programs made 1955 the year that the network was first profitable and as a station owner.\n\nBy 1954, all U.S. networks had regained control of their programming, with higher advertising revenues: ABC's revenue increased by 67% (earning $26 million), NBC's went up by 30% ($100 million) and CBS's rose by 44% ($117 million). However that year, ABC had only 14 primary affiliates compared to the 74 that carried the majority of CBS programs and the 71 that were primarily affiliated with NBC. Most markets outside the largest ones were not large enough to support three full-time network affiliates. In some markets that were large enough for a third full-time affiliate, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. Until the All-Channel Receiver Act (passed by Congress in 1961) mandated the inclusion of UHF tuning, most viewers needed to purchase a converter to be able to watch UHF stations, and the signal quality was marginal at best even with a converter. Additionally, during the analog television era, UHF stations were not adequately receivable in rugged terrain. These factors made many prospective station owners skittish about investing in a UHF station, especially one that would have had to take on an affiliation with a weaker network.\n\nAs a result, with the exception of the largest markets, ABC was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations, usually via off-hours clearances (a notable exception during this time was WKST-TV in Youngstown, Ohio, now WYTV, despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to Cleveland and Pittsburgh even decades before the city's economic collapse). According to Goldenson, this meant that an hour of ABC programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors. However, the network's intake of money at the time would allow it to accelerate its content production. Still, ABC's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s, with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s, which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling, West Virginia, to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before.\n\nThe DuMont Television Network ceased broadcasting on September 15, 1955, and went bankrupt the next year. ABC then found itself as the third U.S. television network, dubbed the \"little third network\", but still continued to look for successful programming. That same year, Kintner was forced to resign due to disagreements between Noble and Goldenson, a consequence of Goldenson's many interventions in ABC's management.\n\nIt was not until the late 1950s that the ABC network became a serious contender to NBC and CBS, and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public, such as westerns and detective series. Despite an almost 500% increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958, the network only had a national reach of between 10% and 18% of the total U.S. population, as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than NBC and CBS. In 1957, ABC Entertainment president Ollie Trez discovered that the locally produced variety show \"Bandstand\" had pulled very strong ratings in the Philadelphia market on WFIL-TV; Trez ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national, under the revised title \"American Bandstand\"; the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to America's youth and helped make a star out of its host, Dick Clark.\n\nOn September 3, 1958, the \"Disneyland\" anthology series was retitled \"Walt Disney Presents\" as it became disassociated with the theme park of the same name. The movement in westerns, which ABC is credited for having started, represented a fifth of all primetime series on American television in January 1959, at which point detective shows were beginning to rise in popularity as well. ABC requested additional productions from Disney. In late 1958, Desilu Productions pitched its detective series \"The Untouchables\" Starring Robert Stack to CBS; after that network rejected the show because of its use of violence, Desilu then presented it to ABC, which agreed to pick up the show, and debuted \"The Untouchables\" in April 1959. The series went on to quickly become \"immensely popular\".\n\nThese kinds of programs presented ABC with an image of the \"philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors\", offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks, which helped Goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television. ABC's western series (as well as series such as the actioner \"Zorro\") went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by NBC and CBS in the fall of 1957, and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959. To captivate the network's audiences, short 66-minute series were scheduled a half-hour before their hour-long competition. In May 1961, \"Life\" criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law \"replacing the good programs with the bad ones\".\n\nDuring the 1960s, ABC continued on the same path that it began to take in the mid-1950s, by consolidating the network as part of its effort to gain loyalty from the public. The network's finances improved and allowed it to invest in other properties and programming. In May 1960, ABC purchased Farm Progress, owner Chicago radio station WLS, which had shared airtime with WENR since the 1920s. This acquisition allowed ABC to consolidate its presence in the market. On May 9, 1960, WLS launched a new lineup consisting of ABC Radio programming. Farm Progress also owned farm newspapers such as \"Prairie Farmer\".\n\nIn 1960, Canadian entrepreneur John Bassett, who was trying to establish a television station in Toronto, sought the help of ABC to launch the station. Leonard Goldenson agreed to acquire a 25% interest in CFTO-TV; however, legislation by the Canadian Radio-Television Commission prohibited ABC's involvement, resulting in the company withdrawing from the project before the station's launch.\n\nThe 1960s would be marked by the rise of family-oriented series in an attempt by ABC to counterprogram its established competitors, but the decade was also marked by the network's gradual transition to color. On September 30, 1960, ABC premiered \"The Flintstones\", another example of counterprogramming; although the animated series from William Hanna and Joseph Barbera was filmed in color from the beginning, it was initially broadcast in black and white, as ABC had not made the necessary technical upgrades to broadcast its programming in color at the time. \"The Flintstones\" allowed ABC to present a novelty, that of prime-time animated programming, but it also allowed the network to begin filling the hole opened by the conclusion of the Disney partnership by carrying family-oriented programming from other producers.\n\nIn 1959, Walt Disney Productions, having improved its financial situation, had purchased ABC's shares in the Disneyland theme park for $7.5 million and initiated discussions to renew ABC's television contract for \"Walt Disney Presents\", which was due to expire in 1961. Walt Disney was approached by NBC to produce color broadcasts of his anthology series (which would be renamed \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\"). Goldenson said ABC could not counter the offer, because the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in the format. As a result, ABC and Disney's first television collaboration ended in 1961 (the network would resume its relationship with Disney in 1985, when the anthology series returned to the network for a three-season run as the \"Disney Sunday Movie\" until it lost the rights to NBC again in 1988; the Disney anthology series would return to ABC in 1996, following the company's purchase of the future Capital Cities/ABC, as \"The Wonderful World of Disney\").\n\nHowever, in 1961, ABC continued with its niche in animated series with \"Calvin and the Colonel\", \"Matty's Funday Funnies\", \"Top Cat\" and \"The Bugs Bunny Show\", the latter of which showcased classic \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Merrie Melodies\" shorts.\n\nAlways in search of new programs that would help it compete with NBC and CBS, ABC's management believed that sports could be a major catalyst in improving the network's market share. On April 29, 1961, ABC debuted \"Wide World of Sports\", an anthology series created by Edgar Scherick through his company Sports Programs, Inc. and produced by a young Roone Arledge which featured a different sporting event each broadcast. ABC purchased Sports Programs, Inc. in exchange for shares in the company, leading it to become the future core of ABC Sports, with Arledge as the executive producer of that division's shows. \"Wide World of Sports\", in particular, was not merely devoted to a single sport, but rather to generally all sporting events.\n\nDue to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, ABC joined CBS and NBC in broadcasting films on Sunday nights in 1962, with the launch of the \"ABC Sunday Night Movie\", which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white. Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), ABC remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by CBS at the same period. To catch up, ABC followed up \"The Flintstones\" with another animated series from Hanna-Barbera, \"The Jetsons\", which debuted on September 23, 1962, as the first television series to be broadcast in color on the network. On April 1, 1963, ABC debuted the soap opera \"General Hospital\", which would go on to become the television network's long-running entertainment program. That year also saw the premiere of \"The Fugitive\" (on September 17), a drama series starring David Janssen, centering on a man on the run after being accused of committing a murder he did not commit. This program, like \"The Untouchables\", went on to become an enormous hit.\n\nThe 1964–65 season was marked by the debuts of several classic series including \"Bewitched\" (on September 17) and \"The Addams Family\" (on September 18). Arledge's success with acquiring prime sports content was confirmed in 1964 when he was appointed vice-president of ABC Sports.\n\nIt was not until the 1965–66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks. ABC, meanwhile, remained in third place and still needed money to grow itself into a major competitor. However, ABC's issues with its transition to color became secondary compared to the network's financial problems; in 1964, the network found itself, as Goldenson later wrote in the 1991 book \"Beating the Odds: The Untold Story Behind the Rise of ABC\", \"in the middle of a war [where] the battlefield was Wall Street\". Many companies sought to take over ABC, including Norton Simon, General Electric, Gulf and Western Industries, International Telephone and Telegraph and Litton Industries.\n\nIn 1965, the corporate entity, American Broadcasting-Paramount Theatres, was renamed as the American Broadcasting Companies, while its cinema division became ABC Theatres; its recording division was renamed ABC Records in 1966. In December of that year, the ABC television network premiered \"The Dating Game\", a pioneer series in its genre, which was a reworking of the blind date concept in which a suitor selected one of three contestants sight unseen based on the answers to selected questions. This was followed up in July 1966 by \"The Newlywed Game\", featuring three recently married couples who guessed the responses to their partner's questions (some of which were fairly risque). As ABC began to outgrow its facilities at 7 West 66th Street, Goldenson found a new headquarters for ABC in a 44-story building located at 1330 Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan, at the corner of 54th Street (now occupied by \"The Financial Times\"s New York office). This operation allowed for the conversion of the premises at 66th Street into production facilities for television and radio programs.\n\nOn December 7, 1965, Goldenson announced a merger proposal with ITT to ABC management; the two companies agreed to the deal on April 27, 1966. The FCC approved the merger on December 21, 1966; however, the previous day (December 20), Donald F. Turner, head antitrust regulator for the United States Department of Justice, expressed doubts related to such issues as the emerging cable television market, and concerns over the journalistic integrity of ABC and how it could be influenced by the overseas ownership of ITT. ITT management promised that the company would allow ABC to retain autonomy in the publishing business. The merger was suspended, and a complaint was filed by the Department of Justice in July 1967, with ITT going to trial in October 1967; the merger was officially canceled after the trial's conclusion on January 1, 1968.\n\nOn January 12, 1966, ABC replaced \"The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet\" with \"Batman\", an action series based on the DC Comics series starring Adam West that was known for its kitschy style. In 1967, WLS radio CEO Ralph Beaudin was appointed as the president of ABC Radio. Under his leadership, ABC Radio was divided into four \"networks\" devoted to different types of programming: news, informative series, pop music, and talk shows. Two other networks were later created to provide rock music and traffic reporting.\n\nIn 1968, ABC took advantage of new FCC ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide in order to purchase Houston radio stations KXYZ and KXYZ-FM for $1 million in shares and $1.5 million in bonds. That year, Roone Arledge was named president of ABC Sports; the company also founded ABC Pictures, a film production company which released its first picture that year, the Ralph Nelson-directed \"Charly\". It was renamed ABC Motion Pictures in 1979; the unit was dissolved in 1985. The studio also operated two subsidiaries, Palomar Pictures International and Selmur Pictures. In July 1968, ABC continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of ABC Marine World in Redwood City, California; that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986, with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of Oracle Corporation.\n\nIn July 1968, ABC Radio launched a special programming project for its FM stations, which was spearheaded by Allen Shaw, a former program manager at WCFL in Chicago who was approached by ABC Radio president Harold L. Neal to develop a format to compete with the new progressive rock and DJ-helmed stations. The new concept called \"LOVE Radio\", which featured a limited selection of music genres, was launched on ABC's seven owned-and-operated FM stations in late November 1968; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations; however, several affiliates (such as KXYZ) retained the majority of their content. In August 1970, Shaw announced that ABC FM's music choice policy should be reviewed to allow listeners access to many styles of music.\n\nOn the television side, in September 1969, ABC launched the \"Movie of the Week\", a weekly showcase aimed at capitalizing on the growing success of made-for-TV movies since the early 1960s. The \"Movie of the Week\" broadcast feature-length dramatic films directed by such talented filmmakers as Aaron Spelling, David Wolper and Steven Spielberg (the latter of whom gained early success through the showcase for his 1971 film \"Duel\") that were produced on an average budget of $400,000–$450,000. One of those movies – \" A Matter of Humanities\", broadcast in early 1969 – became the basis for the hit show Marcus Welby, M.D. which, in its second season (1970–1971), became ABC's first Number One show in the Nielsen ratings (Bewitched was the closest the network had come prior to this, reaching #2 in its debut season, 1964–1965). Other hits for the television network during the late 1960s and early 1970s included the comedies \"The Courtship of Eddie's Father\", \"The Brady Bunch\" and \"The Partridge Family\", the now-iconic \"That Girl\", the Emmy-winning \"Room 222\", and the drama \"The Mod Squad\".\n\nIn the early 1970s, ABC completed its transition to color; the decade as a whole would mark a turning point for ABC, as it began to pass CBS and NBC in the ratings to become the first place network. It also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences. ABC's gains in audience share were greatly helped by the fact that several smaller markets had grown large enough to allow full-time affiliations from all three networks.\n\nIn 1970, ABC debuted \"Monday Night Football\" as part of its Monday prime time schedule; the program became a hit for the network and served as the National Football League (NFL)'s premier game of the week until 2006, when \"Sunday Night Football\", which moved to NBC that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw \"MNF\" move to ESPN, took over as the league's marquee game. According to Goldenson, \"Monday Night Football\" helped earn ABC regularly score an audience share of 15%–16%; ABC Sports managed the budget for the Monday night time slot to reallocate the weekly budget for ABC's prime time schedule to just six days, as opposed to seven on competing networks. 1970 also saw the premieres of several soap operas including the long-running \"All My Children\", which ran on the network for 41 years.\n\nIn 1970, the FCC voted to pass the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, a set of regulations aimed at preventing the major networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by barring them from owning any of the prime time programming that they broadcast. In 1972, the new rules resulted in the company's decision to split ABC Films into two separate companies: the existing Worldvision Enterprises, which would produce and distribute programming for U.S. syndication, and ABC Circle Films as a production unit. Worldvision was sold to a consortium of ABC executives for nearly $10 million.\n\nIn April 1970, Congress passed the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act which banned cigarette advertising from all television and radio networks, including ABC, when it took effect on January 2, 1971. Citing limited profitability of its cinemas, ABC Great States, the Central West division of ABC Theatres, was sold to Henry G. Plitt in 1974. On January 17, 1972, Elton Rule was named President and Chief Operating Officer of ABC a few months after Goldenson reduced his role in the company after suffering a heart attack.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Michael Eisner, who joined ABC in 1966, became the network's program development manager. He helped bring about ideas for many series including \"Happy Days\" (which originated as a segment on the anthology series \"Love, American Style\"), as well as several soap operas; however, Eisner's main credit at ABC was for developing youth-oriented programming. He was responsible for reacquiring the rights to the Looney Tunes-Merrie Melodies library, bringing the shorts back to ABC after spending several years on CBS, as well as developing \"The Jackson 5ive\" animated series and a series about the Osmonds, and greenlighting \"Super Friends\", based on DC Comics' Justice League of America series He also laid ground-work for the development of educational children's programming (predating the 1990 Congressional passage of the Children's Television Act) through interstitials such as \"Time for Timer\", \"The Bod Squad\" and, perhaps most famously, \"Schoolhouse Rock!\". Eisner left ABC in 1976 to become president of Paramount Pictures; he would later become the President of ABC's eventual parent company, Disney.\n\nIn the spring of 1975, Fred Pierce, the newly appointed president of ABC Television, convinced Fred Silverman to become the first president and director of programming of the independent television production subsidiary ABC Entertainment, created from the network's namesake programming division. In 1974, ABC premiered the police series \"S.W.A.T.\" That same year, the network made the decision to compete with NBC's morning news-talk program \"Today\". Its first attempt at such competition was \"AM America\"; however, that show's success was not straightforward. One of its affiliates, WCVB-TV premiered morning show \"Good Day!\". First premiering in 1973 as \"Good Morning!\", it was groundbreaking for being entirely produced on the road and broadcasting from locations outside the Boston area. Also, in the summer of 1975, ABC discovered that its Cleveland affiliate WEWS-TV was producing its own morning program \"The Morning Exchange\", which debuted in 1972 and was now locally pre-empting \"AM America\"; it was the first morning show to utilize a set modeled after a living room, and established a concept now commonplace among network morning shows in which news and weather updates were featured at the top and bottom of each hour. Discovering that their formats seemed to appeal to their viewers, the network became the first to adopt them for a new national morning show, \"Good Morning America\", which debuted on November 3, 1975.\n\nThe 1970s were highlighted by several successful comedy, fantasy, action and superhero-themed series for the network including \"Kung Fu\", \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", \"Wonder Woman\", \"Starsky & Hutch\", \"Charlie's Angels\", \"The Bionic Woman\", \"Fantasy Island\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\". Many of these series were greenlit by Silverman, who left ABC in 1978 to become president of NBC's entertainment division. The rousing success of \"Happy Days\" also led to a successful spin-off series, \"Laverne & Shirley\", which debuted during the 1975–76 season. \"Charlie's Angels\" and \"Three's Company\" (which debuted during the 1976–77 season) were two prime examples of a trend among the major networks during the 1970s known as \"jiggle TV\", featuring attractive, often buxom, women in main and guest roles.\n\nIn 1977, Henry Plitt, who at the time was associated with Thomas Klutznick, a real estate entrepreneur in Chicago, purchased the southern division of ABC Theatres, ABC Southern. The sale stripped ABC of control over its theaters as a result of changes in the theater operation sector, mainly the fact that the population was migrating to the suburbs and moving away from older cinemas in larger cities (Plitt Theatres was later purchased by Cineplex Odeon Corporation in 1987).\n\nFor its part, the television network produced a few new hits during 1977: January saw the premiere of \"Roots\", a miniseries based on an Alex Haley novel that was published the previous year. \"Roots\" went on to become one of the highest-rated programs in American television history, with unprecedented ratings for its finale. In September, \"The Love Boat\", a comedy-drama anthology series produced by Aaron Spelling which was based around the crew of a cruise ship and featured three stories centered partly on the ship's various passengers; although critically lambasted, the series turned out to be a ratings success and lasted nine seasons. The success of \"Roots\", \"Happy Days\" and \"The Love Boat\" allowed the network to take first place in the ratings for the first time in the 1976–77 season. On September 13, 1977, the network debuted \"Soap\", a controversial soap opera parody which became known for being the first television series to feature an openly gay main character (played by a then-unknown Billy Crystal); it last ran on the network on April 20, 1981.\n\nMeanwhile, ABC News, which formed as a newly separate division, sought to become a global leader in television news. In 1977, Roone Arledge was named president of the new ABC News in addition to being president of ABC Sports. That same year, ABC launched a major expansion of its office facilities in New York City. The company first constructed a new 10-story building on land previously occupied by an abandoned warehouse on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street; the facility that was built in its place is nicknamed \"7 Lincoln Square\" (although it is actually located at 149 Columbus Avenue). Meanwhile, a former parking lot, located at 30 West 67th Street, was transformed into an impressive 15-story building. Both buildings were completed in June 1979. WABC-TV moved its operations from offices at 77 West 66th Street to 149 Columbus Avenue, freeing up space for the ABC network to house some of its operations.\n\nIn June 1978, Arledge created the newsmagazine \"20/20\"; after its first episode received harshly negative reviews, the program – which debuted as a summer series, before becoming a year-round program in 1979 – was immediately revamped to feature a mix of in-depth stories and interviews, with Hugh Downs appointed as its anchor (later paired alongside his former \"Today\" colleague Barbara Walters). A month later, ABC revamped its evening newscasts (which previously aired under the name \"ABC Evening News\" since its launch in 1970) under the name \"World News Tonight\". In February 1979, ABC sold its recording division to MCA Inc. for $20 million; the label was discontinued by March 5 of that year, and all of its 300 employees were laid off (the rights to the works of ABC Records and all of MCA's other labels have since been acquired by Universal Music Group).\n\nABC entered the publishing business in the 1970s and formed ABC Publishing in 1977. Acquisitions included \"Modern Photography\" and \"High Fidelity\" in 1974, Word Inc. in 1976, properties of CHC Corporation (\"Los Angeles\" and the National Insurance Law Service) in 1977, and Chilton in 1979.\n\nABC dominated the American television landscape during the 1970s and early 1980s (by 1980, the three major networks represented 90% of all prime-time television viewership in the U.S.). Several flagship series debuted on the network during this time including \"Dynasty\", an opulent drama from Aaron Spelling that became a hit when it premiered as a midseason series in 1981, five months before Spelling's other ABC hit \"Charlie's Angels\" ended its run. The network was also propelled during the early 1980s by the continued successes of \"Happy Days\", \"Three's Company\", \"Laverne & Shirley\" and \"Fantasy Island\", and gained new hits in \"Too Close for Comfort\", \"Soap\" spinoff \"Benson\" and \"Happy Days\" spinoff \"Mork & Mindy\". In 1981, ABC (through its ABC Video Services division) launched the Alpha Repertory Television Service (ARTS), a cable channel operated as a joint venture with the Hearst Corporation offering cultural and arts programming, which aired as a nighttime service over the channel space of Nickelodeon.\nOn August 9, 1982, ABC purchased a 10% stake in the Entertainment and Sports Programming Network (ESPN) for $20 million; in exchange for the interest, ESPN gained the U.S. television rights to the British Open, which ABC had not been able to broadcast in its entirety. The purchase provided ABC the option of purchasing additional shares of up to 49% under certain conditions, which included the option to purchase at least 10% of Getty Oil's shares in the channel prior to January 2, 1984.\n\nIn 1983, ABC sold KXYZ to the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation. On January 4, 1984, \"The New York Times\" reported that ABC, through its subsidiary ABC Video Enterprises, had exercised its option to purchase up to 15% (or between $25 million and $30 million) of Getty Oil's shares in ESPN, which would allow it to expand its shares at a later date. In June 1984, ABC's executive committee approved the company's interest acquisition in ESPN, and ABC arranged with Getty Oil to obtain an 80% stake in the channel, while selling the remaining 20% to Nabisco. That year, ABC and Hearst reached an agreement with RCA to merge ARTS and competing arts service, The Entertainment Channel, into a single cable channel called Arts & Entertainment Television (A&E); the new channel subsequently leased a separate satellite transponder, ending its sharing agreement with Nickelodeon to become a 24-hour service. Meanwhile, ABC withdrew from the theme park business for good when it sold the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park.\n\nIn December 1984, Thomas S. Murphy, chief executive officer of Capital Cities Communications, contacted Leonard Goldenson about a proposal to merge their respective companies. On March 16, 1985, ABC's executive committee accepted the merger offer, which was formally announced on March 18, 1985, with Capital Cities purchasing ABC and its related properties for $3.5 billion and $118 for each of ABC's shares as well as a guarantee of 10% (or $3) for a total of $121 per share. The merger shocked the entertainment industry, as Capital Cities was some 4 times smaller than ABC was at the time. To finance the purchase, Capital Cities borrowed $2.1 billion from a consortium of banks, which sold certain assets that Capital Cities could not acquire or retain due to FCC ownership rules for a combined $900 million and sold off several cable television systems, which were sold to The Washington Post Company (forming the present-day Cable One). The remaining $500 million was loaned by Warren Buffett, who promised that his company Berkshire Hathaway would purchase $3 million in shares, at $172.50 apiece. Due to an FCC ban on same-market ownership of television and radio stations by a single company (although the deal would have otherwise complied with new ownership rules implemented by the FCC in January 1985, that allowed broadcasters to own a maximum of 12 television stations), ABC and Capital Cities respectively decided to sell WXYZ-TV and Tampa independent station WFTS-TV to the E. W. Scripps Company (although Capital Cities/ABC originally intended to seek a cross-ownership waiver to retain WXYZ and Capital Cities-owned radio stations WJR and WHYT). The deal was, at the time, the largest non-oil merger in world business history. However, this record would be surpassed by year's end by the merger of General Electric and RCA (the latter company then being the parent company of rival network NBC).\n\nThe merger between ABC and Capital Cities received federal approval on September 5, 1985. After the ABC/Capital Cities merger was finalized on January 3, 1986, the combined company – which became known as Capital Cities/ABC, Inc. – added four television stations (WPVI-TV/Philadelphia, KTRK-TV/Houston, KFSN-TV/Fresno and WTVD/Raleigh) and several radio stations to ABC's broadcasting portfolio, and also included Fairchild Publications and four newspapers (including \"The Kansas City Star\" and \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\"). It also initiated several changes in its management: Frederick S. Pierce was named president of ABC's broadcasting division; Michael P. Millardi became vice president of ABC Broadcasting, and president of ABC Owned Stations and ABC Video Enterprises; John B. Sias was appointed president of the ABC Television Network; Brandon Stoddard became president of ABC Entertainment (a position to which he had been appointed in November 1985); and Roone Arledge became president of ABC News and ABC Sports. In February 1986, Thomas S. Murphy, who had been serving as CEO of Capital Cities since 1964, was appointed chairman and CEO emeritus of ABC. Jim Duffy stepped down as ABC Television president for a management position at ABC Communications, a subsidiary that specialized in community service programming, including shows related to literary education.\n\nAs far as programming is concerned, four of ABC's marquee shows of the 1970s ended their runs during the mid-1980s: \"Laverne & Shirley\" ended its run in 1983, \"Happy Days\" and \"Three's Company\" ended in 1984 (with the latter producing a short-lived spinoff that year), while \"The Love Boat\" ended its run in 1986. After nearly a decade of ratings trouble, NBC had regained the ratings lead among the Big Three networks in 1984 on the success of series such as \"The Cosby Show\", \"Cheers\" and \"Miami Vice\". To counteract NBC, ABC decided to refocus itself on comedies and family-oriented series beginning in the mid-1980s including \"Who's the Boss?\", \"Mr. Belvedere\", \"Growing Pains\", \"Perfect Strangers\", \"Head of the Class\", \"Full House\", \"The Wonder Years\", \"Just the Ten of Us\" and \"Roseanne\".\n\nFollowing the initial success of these series, ABC revamped its Friday night schedule around family-friendly comedies in the late 1980s, culminating in the 1989 debut of the \"TGIF\" block (which promotions referenced stood for \"Thank Goodness It's Funny\"). Many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by Miller-Boyett Productions, a Warner Bros.-based studio that briefly programmed the entire Friday lineup during the 1990–91 season (with \"Going Places\" joining \"Family Matters\", \"Full House\" and \"Perfect Strangers\" on the \"TGIF\" schedule) and through its development deal with Paramount Television prior to 1986 (as Miller-Milkis, and later, Miller-Milkis-Boyett Productions), had earlier produced \"Happy Days\" and its various spinoffs among other series for the network.\n\nIn 1988, ABC constructed a new building to serve as the network's headquarters, located near the studios of WABC-TV on West 66th Street. The television network's restructuring program, launched in 1974, helped with the purchases and exchanges of nearly 70 stations during the late 1980s, and aided in increasing its ratings by more than 2 million viewers.\n\nIn 1989, ABC sold \"High Fidelity\" and \"Modern Photography\" to Diamandis Communications, who merged them with other magazines.\n\nIn 1990, Thomas S. Murphy delegated his position as president to Daniel B. Burke while remaining ABC's chairman and CEO. Capital Cities/ABC reported revenues of $465 million. Now at a strong second place, the network entered the 1990s with additional family-friendly hits including \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (which has gone on to become the longest-running prime time entertainment program in the network's history), \"Step by Step\", \"Hangin' with Mr. Cooper\", \"Boy Meets World\" and \"Perfect Strangers\" spinoff \"Family Matters\", as well as series such as \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\", \"Life Goes On\", cult favorite \"Twin Peaks\" and \"The Commish\". In September 1991, the network premiered \"Home Improvement\", a sitcom starring stand-up comic Tim Allen centering on the family and work life of an accident-prone host of a cable-access home improvement show. Lasting eight seasons, its success led ABC to greenlight additional sitcom projects helmed by comedians during the 1990s including \"The Drew Carey Show\"; Brett Butler vehicle \"Grace Under Fire\"; and \"Ellen\", which became notable for a 1997 episode which served as the coming out of series star Ellen DeGeneres (as well as her character in the series) as a lesbian.\n\nIn 1992, ABC sold Word Inc. to Thomas Nelson.\n\nIn 1993, the FCC repealed the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, once again allowing networks to hold interests in television production studios. That same year, Capital Cities/ABC formed a limited partnership with DIC Animation City known as DIC Entertainment L.P. it also signed an agreement with Time Warner Cable to carry its owned-and-operated television stations on the provider's systems in ABC O&O markets. By that year, ABC had a total viewership share of 23.63% of American households, just below the limit of 25% imposed by the FCC.\n\nDaniel Burke departed from Capital Cities/ABC in February 1994, with Thomas Murphy taking over as president before ceding control to Robert Iger. September 1993 saw the debut of \"NYPD Blue\", a gritty police procedural from Steven Bochco (who created \"Doogie Howser, M.D.\" and the critically pilloried \"Cop Rock\" for ABC earlier in the decade); lasting twelve seasons, the drama became known for its boundary pushing of network television standards (particularly its occasional use of graphic language and rear nudity), which led some affiliates to initially refuse to air the show in its first season.\n\nIn order to compete with CNN, ABC proposed a 24-hour news channel called ABC Cable News, with plans to launch the network in 1995; however, the plan would ultimately be shelved by company management. ABC would reattempt such a concept in July 2004 with the launch of ABC News Now, a 24-hour news channel distributed for viewing on the Internet and mobile phones. On August 29, 1994, ABC purchased Flint, Michigan, affiliate WJRT-TV and WTVG in Toledo, Ohio (which was previously affiliated with ABC from 1958 to 1970) from SJL Broadcast Management, with the latter switching to ABC once its contract with NBC expired two months after the purchase was finalized in early 1995. Both stations were acquired as a contingency plan in the event that CBS reached an affiliation deal with WXYZ-TV (to replace WJBK, which switched to Fox as a result of that network's group affiliation agreement with New World Communications) in order to allow the network to retain some over-the-air presence in the Detroit market (the E.W. Scripps Company and ABC would reach a group affiliation deal that renewed affiliation agreements with WXYZ and WEWS, and switch four other stations, including two whose Fox affiliations were displaced by the New World deal, with the network).\n\nOn July 31, 1995, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement to merge with Capital Cities/ABC for $19 billion. Disney shareholders approved the merger at a special conference in New York City on January 4, 1996, with the acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC being completed on February 9; following the sale, Disney renamed its new subsidiary ABC Inc. In addition to the ABC network, the Disney acquisition integrated ABC's ten owned-and-operated television and 21 radio stations; its 80% interest in ESPN, ownership interests in The History Channel, A&E Television Networks, and Lifetime Entertainment, DIC Productions L.P.; and Capital Cities/ABC's magazine and newspaper properties into the company. Following the merger, Thomas S. Murphy left ABC with Robert Iger taking his place as president and CEO.\n\nDisney sold several ABC divisions after the merger. As FCC ownership rules forbade the company from keeping both it and KABC-TV, Disney sold Los Angeles independent station KCAL-TV to Young Broadcasting for $387 million. Farm Progress was sold to the Australian company Rural Press. NILS was sold to Wolters Kluwer.\n\nAround the time of the merger, Disney's television production units had already produced series for the network such as \"Home Improvement\" and \"Boy Meets World\", while the deal also allowed ABC access to Disney's children's programming library for its Saturday morning block. In 1998, ABC premiered the Aaron Sorkin-created sitcom \"Sports Night\", centering on the travails of the staff of a \"SportsCenter\"-style sports news program; despite earning critical praise and multiple Emmy Awards, the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons.\n\nOn May 10, 1999, Disney reorganized its publishing division, the Buena Vista Publishing Group, renaming it as Disney Publishing Worldwide; the rechristened division became a subsidiary of Disney Consumer Products while Hyperion Books became affiliated with ABC. On July 8, 1999, Disney consolidated Walt Disney Television Studio, Buena Vista Television Productions and ABC's primetime division into the ABC Entertainment Television Group.\n\nIn August 1999, ABC premiered a special series event, \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", a game show based on the British program of the same title. Hosted throughout its ABC tenure by Regis Philbin, the program became a major ratings success throughout its initial summer run, which led ABC to renew \"Millionaire\" as a regular series, returning on January 18, 2000. At its peak, the program aired as much as six nights a week. Buoyed by \"Millionaire\", during the 1999–2000 season, ABC became the first network to move from third to first place in the ratings during a single television season. \"Millionaire\" ended its run on the network's primetime lineup after three years in 2002, and in September of that year, Buena Vista Television relaunched the show as a syndicated program which throughout its run starred various hosts, of whom the first and longest-tenured, Meredith Vieira, became the first woman to win multiple Emmy Awards for hosting a game show. \"Millionaire\" would ultimately end its run in 2019 after a total of 20 seasons.\n\nIn 2000, Disney sold \"Los Angeles\" to Emmis Communications.\n\nIn addition to \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\", the network entered the 2000s with hits held over from the previous decade such as \"The Practice\", \"NYPD Blue\" and \"The Wonderful World of Disney\" and new series such as \"My Wife and Kids\" and \"According to Jim\", all of which managed to help ABC stay ahead of the competition in the ratings in spite of the later departure of \"Millionaire\". 2000 saw the end of the original \"TGIF\", which was struggling to find new hits following the loss of \"Family Matters\" and \"Step by Step\" to CBS as part of its own failed attempt at a family-oriented Friday comedy block in the 1997–98 season. Outside of \"20/20\", Friday nights remained a weak spot for ABC for the next 11 years.\n\nOn April 30, 2000, as a result of a carriage dispute with ABC, Time Warner Cable removed ABC owned-and-operated stations from the cable provider's systems in four markets (WABC-TV in New York City, KABC-TV in Los Angeles, KTRK in Houston and WTVD in Raleigh-Durham). The network had earlier reached an eleventh-hour deal to renew its carriage agreement with the provider on December 31, 1999. ABC filed an emergency petition to the Federal Communications Commission on May 1 to force TWC to restore the affected stations; the FCC ruled in favor of ABC, ordering Time Warner Cable to restore the stations, doing so on the afternoon of May 2. ABC ended the 2000–01 season as the most-watched network, ahead of NBC.\n\nNetworks affiliates approved a two-year affiliate agreement in 2002. In September 2006, Disney Chairman/CEO Michael Eisner outlined a proposed realignment of the ABC broadcast network day parts with the similar unit in its cable channels: ABC Saturday mornings with Disney Channels (Toon & Playhouse), ABC daytime with Soapnet and ABC prime time with ABC Family. 2002 saw the debut of the network's first hit reality series, \"The Bachelor\" (the elimination-style dating show's success led to a spinoff, \"The Bachelorette\", which premiered the following year, as well as two additional spinoffs that later debuted in the early 2010s).\n\nIn 2004, ABC's average viewership declined by ten ratings points, landing the network in fourth place, behind NBC, CBS and Fox (by the following year, the combined season-ending average audience share of ABC, NBC and CBS represented only 32% of U.S. households). However, during the 2004–05 season, the network experienced unexpected success with new series such as \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Lost\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\" as well as reality series \"Dancing with the Stars\", which helped ABC rise to second place, jumping ahead of CBS, but behind a surging Fox. On April 21, 2004, Disney announced a restructuring of its Disney Media Networks division with Marvin Jacobs being named president of ABC parent Disney–ABC Television Group, and ESPN president George Bodenheimer becoming co-CEO of the division with Jacobs, as well as president of ABC Sports. On December 7, 2005, ABC Sports and ESPN signed an eight-year broadcast rights agreement with NASCAR, allowing ABC and ESPN to broadcast 17 NASCAR Cup Series races each season (comprising just over half of the 36 races held annually) effective with the 2006 season.\n\nBetween May and September 2005, rumors circulated that Disney–ABC was considering a sale of ABC Radio, with Clear Channel Communications and Westwood One (which had earlier purchased NBC's radio division, as well as the distribution rights to CBS's, and the Mutual Broadcasting System during the 1990s) as potential buyers. On October 19, 2005, ABC announced the restructuring of the group into six divisions: Entertainment Communications, Communications Resources, Kids Communications, News Communications, Corporate Communications, and International Communications.\n\nOn February 6, 2007, The Walt Disney Company announced an agreement with Citadel Broadcasting to merge the ABC Radio Network with Citadel. The new entity, Citadel Communications, was majority owned (52%) by Disney, in conjunction with Forstmann Little (32%) and former shareholders of Citadel Broadcasting (16%). Citadel eventually merged with Cumulus Media in September 2011.\n\nIn February 2007, Disney announced that it would rename its Touchstone Television production unit as the ABC Television Studio (simplified to ABC Studios by that summer), as part of a corporate move to eliminate secondary production brands such as Buena Vista. In May 2007, ABC unveiled a new image campaign, revolving around the slogan \"Start Here\", which highlighted the multi-platform availability of ABC's program content.\n\nThe Writers Guild of America strike that halted production of network programs for much of the 2007–08 season affected the network in 2007–08 and 2008–09, as various ABC shows that premiered in 2007, such as \"Dirty Sexy Money\", \"Pushing Daisies\", \"Eli Stone\" and \"Samantha Who?\", did not live to see a third season; other series such as \"Boston Legal\" and the U.S. version of \"Life on Mars\" suffered from low viewership, despite the former, a spin off of \"The Practice\", being a once-highlighted breakout series when it debuted in 2005. One of the network's strike-replacement programs during that time was the game show \"Duel\", which premiered in December 2007. The program would become a minor success for the network during its initial six-episode run, which led ABC to renew \"Duel\" as a regular series starting in April 2008. However, \"Duel\" suffered from low viewership during its run as a regular series, and ABC canceled the program after sixteen episodes. On August 15, 2008, Disney denied rumors started by Caris & Co. that it would be selling the ten ABC owned-and-operated stations.\n\nIn early 2009, Disney–ABC Television Group merged ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios into a new division, ABC Entertainment Group, which would be responsible for both its production and broadcasting operations. During this reorganization, the group announced that it would lay off 5% of its workforce. On April 2, 2009, Citadel Communications announced that it would rebrand ABC Radio as Citadel Media; however, ABC News continued to provide news content for Citadel. On December 22, Disney–ABC Television Group announced a partnership with Apple Inc. to make individual episodes of ABC and Disney Channel programs available for purchase on iTunes.\n\nIn March 2010, reports suggested that The Walt Disney Company was considering spinning off ABC into an independent company because \"it [did not] add a lot of value to Disney's other divisions\". The company entered advanced negotiations with two private equity firms to sell ABC; however, the planned sale was cancelled as a result of an FBI investigation into allegations of attempted insider trading by an ex-employee which they later denied.\n\nThe network began running into some trouble in the ratings by 2010. That year, the sixth and final season of \"Lost\" became the drama's lowest-rated season since its debut in 2004. Ratings for the once instant-hit \"Ugly Betty\" collapsed dramatically after it was moved to Fridays at the start of its fourth season in the fall of 2009; an attempt to boost ratings by moving the dramedy to Wednesdays failed, with its ultimate cancellation by the network eliciting negative reaction from the public, and particularly the show's fanbase. With the network's two former hit shows now out of the picture, the network's remaining top veteran shows \"Desperate Housewives\" and \"Grey's Anatomy\", and another hit drama \"Brothers & Sisters\", all ended the 2009–10 season having recorded their lowest ratings ever.\n\nAmong the few bright spots during this season were the midseason crime dramedy \"Castle\" as well as the success of two family sitcoms that anchored the network's revamped Wednesday comedy lineup, \"The Middle\" and \"Modern Family\", the latter of which was both a critical and commercial success. \"Shark Tank\" (based on the \"Dragon's Den\" reality format) also became a midseason sleeper hit on Sundays in the spring of 2010; the following season, it became the tentpole of the network's Friday night schedule, gradually helping make ABC a strong competitor (after being paired with \"20/20\" and beginning with the 2012–13 season, the Tim Allen sitcom \"Last Man Standing\") against CBS' long-dominant drama/reality lineup on that night for the first time since the \"TGIF\" lineup ended in 2000.\n\nThe network's troubles with sustaining existing series and gaining new hits spilled over into its 2010–11 schedule: ABC's dramas during that season continued to fail, with the midseason forensic investigation drama \"Body of Proof\" being the only one that was renewed for a second season. The network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year's debuts, with only late-season premiere \"Happy Endings\" earning a second season. Meanwhile, the new lows hit by \"Brothers & Sisters\" led to its cancellation, and the previous year's only drama renewal, \"V\", also failed to earn another season after a low-rated midseason run. Despite this and another noticeable ratings decline, ABC would manage to outrate NBC for third place by a larger margin than the previous year.\n\nWith relatively little buzz surrounding its 2010–11 pilots, compounded by a sexual harassment lawsuit against him, Stephen McPherson resigned as ABC Entertainment Group president on July 27, 2010. Paul Lee (who previously served as the president of sister cable channel ABC Family) was announced as his replacement that same day.\n\nOn April 14, 2011, ABC canceled the long-running soap operas \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" after 41 and 43 years on the air, respectively (following backlash from fans, ABC sold the rights to both shows to Prospect Park, which eventually revived the soaps on Hulu for one additional season in 2013 and with both companies suing one another for allegations of interference with the process of reviving the shows, failure to pay licensing fees and issues over ABC's use of certain characters from \"One Life to Live\" on \"General Hospital\" during the transition). The talk/lifestyle show that replaced \"One Life to Live\", \"The Revolution\", failed to generate satisfactory ratings and was in turn canceled after only seven months. The 2011–12 season saw ABC drop to fourth place in the 18–49 demographic despite renewing a handful of new shows (including freshmen dramas \"Scandal\", \"Revenge\" and \"Once Upon a Time\") for second seasons.\n\nIn 2012, ABC News and Univision Communications announced a partnership to launch an English-language cable news channel primarily aimed at younger English-speaking Hispanics; the new network, Fusion, launched on October 28, 2013. The 2012–13 season failed to live up to the previous year, with only one drama, \"Nashville\", and one comedy, \"The Neighbors\", earning a second season renewal.\n\nThe 2013–14 season was a slight improvement for ABC with three new hits in \"The Goldbergs\", \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" and \"Resurrection\", all of which were renewed; however, that season saw the cancellations of holdovers \"The Neighbors\" (which languished in its new Friday time slot despite being bookended by \"Last Man Standing\" and \"Shark Tank\") and \"Suburgatory\". NBC, which had lagged behind ABC for eight years, finished the season in first place in the 18–49 demographic for the first time since 2004, and in second place in total viewership behind long-dominant CBS. ABC itself would finish the season in third place as Fox crashed to fourth in both demographics.\n\nThe 2014–15 season saw moderate hits in \"Black-ish\" (the first series on the four major U.S. networks to feature a predominantly African-American cast since 2006) and major successes in \"How to Get Away with Murder\" (which, alongside \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"Scandal\", became one of the centerpieces of a new Thursday drama lineup, \"TGIT\", composed of dramas executive produced by Shonda Rhimes). New hits came in with fellow new comedy \"Fresh Off the Boat\", a new drama \"Secrets and Lies\" and a low rated but critically acclaimed show \"American Crime\", all of which were renewed. However, that season saw cancellations of \"Resurrection\" and \"Revenge\".\n\nThe 2015–16 season saw breakout hits such as \"Quantico\", \"The Real O'Neals\", \"The Catch\", and \"Dr. Ken\". On April 18, 2016, ABC and ABC Productions announced that Stana Katic and Tamala Jones would not return for \"Castle\"s ninth season, should it be renewed. Despite several other cast members having signed on for a ninth season, on May 12, 2016, it was announced that the show would be cancelled instead; the final episode aired on May 16, 2016.\n\nThe 2016–17 season saw a successful expansion of the network's Tuesday night comedy line-up by an extra hour, with long-time Wednesday staple \"The Middle\" leading the night, along with the returning \"Fresh Off the Boat\" and \"The Real O'Neals\", and new series \"American Housewife\", \"Imaginary Mary\", and \"Downward Dog\". Wednesday's comedy block, with \"The Goldbergs\" leading the night in place of \"The Middle\", introduced \"Speechless\". Both \"American Housewife\" and \"Speechless\" were renewed for second seasons. This season also saw the cancellation of long-running sitcom \"Last Man Standing\" and \"Dr. Ken\". The former stirred controversy due to allegations that \"Last Man Standing\" was cancelled due to the star Tim Allen's and the show's right-leaning viewpoints. ABC also saw the success of freshman series \"Designated Survivor\". However, the previous season's breakout hit \"Quantico\" saw its ratings decline during its sophomore year.\n\nThe 2017–18 season saw ABC acquire a breakout hit with \"The Good Doctor\", which led to the series getting an early full-season pickup. Additionally, ABC revived former Fox series \"American Idol\" which premiered during the mid-season. As a result, veteran dramas \"Once Upon a Time\" and \"Marvel Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" were displaced to Friday nights, while \"Shark Tank\" was moved to Sunday nights in order to accommodate a time slot for \"American Idol\". This season also saw veteran series \"The Middle\", \"Once Upon a Time\", and \"Scandal\" end their runs. ABC also revived \"Roseanne\", which originally ran from 1988 to 1997, for a tenth season, which saw ratings success. While \"Roseanne\" was initially renewed for an eleventh season, the series was abruptly cancelled due to a scandal involving its star Roseanne Barr, and was retooled without her character as \"The Conners.\"\n\nA major reshuffle in executive leadership also occurred after Disney announced its acquisition of 21st Century Fox On November 16, 2018, Freeform President Karey Burke had succeeded Channing Dungey as head of ABC Entertainment. It was also announced that former head of 20th Century Fox Television Dana Walden had been appointed to take over as head of ABC, Freeform, and all other Disney television-studio operations. Former Fox executive Peter Rice will also manage non-sports television programming for ABC and other Disney networks as well.\n\nThe ABC television network provides 89 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations from 8:00–11:00 p.m. Monday through Saturday (all times Eastern and Pacific Time) and 7:00–11:00 p.m. on Sundays.\n\nDaytime programming is also provided from 11:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. weekdays (with a one-hour break at 12:00 p.m. Eastern/Pacific for stations to air newscasts, other locally produced programming such as talk shows, or syndicated programs) featuring the talk/lifestyle shows \"The View\" and \"Strahan, Sara and Keke\", and the soap opera \"General Hospital\". ABC News programming includes \"Good Morning America\" from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. weekdays (along with one-hour weekend editions); nightly editions of \"ABC World News Tonight\" (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's timeslot), the Sunday political talk show \"This Week\", early morning news programs \"World News Now\" and \"America This Morning\" and the late night newsmagazine \"Nightline\". Late nights feature the weeknight talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\".\n\nThe network's three-hour Saturday morning children's programming timeslot is programmed by syndication distributor Litton Entertainment, which produces \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\" under an arrangement in which the programming block is syndicated exclusively to ABC owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, rather than being leased out directly by the network to Litton.\n\nABC's daytime schedule currently features the talk shows \"The View\" and \"Strahan, Sara and Keke\" (the latter an offshoot of \"Good Morning America\"), and the soap opera \"General Hospital\". Originally premiering in 1963, \"General Hospital\" is ABC's longest-running entertainment program.\n\nIn addition to the long-running \"All My Children\" (1970–2011) and \"One Life to Live\" (1968–2012), notable past soap operas seen on the daytime lineup include \"Ryan's Hope\", \"Dark Shadows\", \"Loving\", \"The City\" and \"Port Charles\". ABC also aired the last nine years of the Procter & Gamble-produced soap \"The Edge of Night\", following its cancellation by CBS in 1975. ABC Daytime has also aired a number of game shows, including \"The Dating Game\", \"The Newlywed Game\", \"Let's Make a Deal\", \"Password\", \"Split Second\", \"The $10,000/$20,000 Pyramid\", \"Family Feud\", \"The Better Sex\", \"Trivia Trap\", \"All-Star Blitz\" and \"Hot Streak\".\n\nSports programming is provided on occasion, primarily on weekend afternoons; since 2006, the ABC Sports division has been defunct, with all sports telecasts on ABC being produced in association with sister cable network ESPN under the branding \"ESPN on ABC\". While ABC has, in the past, aired notable sporting events such as the NFL's \"Monday Night Football\", and various college football bowl games (including, most prominently for a period, the Bowl Championship Series), general industry trends and changes in rights have prompted reductions in sports broadcasts on broadcast television, with Disney thereby preferring to schedule the majority of its sports rights on the networks of ESPN instead (in 2011, the BCS moved exclusively to ESPN after being previously aired by Fox, while the BCS's successor, the College Football Playoff, followed suit).\n\nABC is the broadcast television rightsholder of the National Basketball Association (NBA), with its package (under the \"NBA on ESPN\" branding) traditionally beginning with its Christmas Day games, followed by a series of Saturday night and Sunday afternoon games through the remainder of the season, weekend playoff games, and all games of the NBA Finals. During college football season, ABC typically carries an afternoon doubleheader on Saturdays, along with the primetime \"Saturday Night Football\". ABC also airs coverage of selected bowl games. Beginning in the 2015 NFL season, ESPN agreed to begin simulcasting a wild card playoff game on ABC.\n\nThe Saturday afternoon lineup outside of football season typically features airings of ESPN Films documentaries and other studio programs under the banner \"ESPN Sports Saturday\", while Sunday afternoons usually feature either brokered programming, or encore and burn-off airings of ABC programs.\n\nIn 2015, ESPN's annual ESPY Awards presentation moved to ABC from ESPN. Bolstered by Caitlyn Jenner accepting the inaugural Arthur Ashe Courage Award during the ceremony, the 2015 ESPY Awards' viewership were roughly tripled over the 2014 ceremony on ESPN.\n\nABC currently holds the broadcast rights to the Academy Awards, Emmy Awards (which are rotated across all four major networks on a year-to-year basis), American Music Awards, and the Country Music Association Awards (along with two associated specials, the \"CMA Music Festival\" and \"CMA Country Christmas\"). ABC has also aired the Miss America competition from 1954 to 1956, 1997 to 2005 (with the television rights being assumed by cable channel TLC in 2006, when the event moved from its longtime home in Atlantic City to Las Vegas, before returning to Atlantic City in 2013) and since 2011. Under its recent contract with the Miss America Organization, ABC continued to broadcast the event through 2018, after which the rights to the pageant went to NBC.\n\nSince 2000, ABC has also owned the television rights to most of the \"Peanuts\" television specials, having acquired the broadcast rights from CBS, which originated the specials in 1965 with the debut of \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" (other \"Peanuts\" specials broadcast annually by ABC, including \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", include \"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\" and \"A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving\"). ABC also broadcasts the annual \"Disney Parks Christmas Day Parade\" special on Christmas morning.\n\nSince 1974, ABC has generally aired \"Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve\"—a New Year's Eve special featuring music performances and coverage of festivities in New York's Times Square. It was hosted first by its creator Dick Clark, and later by his successor Ryan Seacrest. The only exception was in 1999, when ABC instead broadcast \"ABC 2000 Today\"—a day-long telecast produced by ABC News as part of the \"2000 Today\" consortium, which was hosted by Peter Jennings and covered festivities from around the world (Dick Clark would join Jennings to co-host coverage from Times Square). ABC is also among the broadcasters of the Tournament of Roses Parade the next day (although as mentioned, the Rose Bowl Game now airs exclusively on ESPN as a College Football Playoff \"New Year's Six\" bowl).\n\nABC owns nearly all its in-house television and theatrical productions made from the 1970s onward, with the exception of certain co-productions with producers (for example, \"The Commish\" is now owned by the estate of its producer, Stephen Cannell). Worldwide video rights are currently owned by various companies; for example, Kino Lorber owns the North American home video rights to the ABC feature film library (along with some lesser known live action films from Disney's library, mostly from Touchstone Pictures, Hollywood Pictures and 20th Century Fox).\n\nWhen the FCC imposed its fin-syn rules in 1970, ABC proactively created two companies: Worldvision Enterprises as a syndication distributor, and ABC Circle Films as a production company. However, between the publication and implementation of these regulations, the separation of the network's catalog was made in 1973. The broadcast rights to pre-1973 productions were transferred to Worldvision, which became independent in the same year. The company has been sold several times since Paramount Television acquired it in 1999, and has most recently been absorbed into CBS Television Distribution, a unit of CBS Corporation. Nonetheless, Worldvision sold portions of its catalog, including the Ruby-Spears and Hanna-Barbera libraries, to Turner Broadcasting System in 1991. With Disney's 1996 purchase of ABC, ABC Circle Films was absorbed into Touchstone Television, a Disney subsidiary which in turn was renamed ABC Studios in 2007.\n\nAlso part of the library are most films in the David O. Selznick library, the Cinerama Productions/Palomar theatrical library (with the exception of those films produced in Cinerama which are now under the control of Pacific Theatres and Flicker Alley), the Selmur Productions catalog that the network acquired some years back, and the in-house productions it continues to produce (such as \"America's Funniest Home Videos\", \"General Hospital\", ABC News productions, as well as series from ABC Studios and 20th Century Fox Television), although Disney–ABC Domestic Television (formerly known as Buena Vista Television) handles domestic television distribution, while Disney–ABC International Television (formerly known as Buena Vista International Television) handles international television distribution.\n\nSince its inception, ABC has had many affiliated stations, which include WABC-TV and WPVI-TV, the first two stations to carry the network's programming. ABC has eight owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 236 additional television stations encompassing 49 states, the District of Columbia, four U.S. possessions, Bermuda and Saba; this makes ABC the largest U.S. broadcast television network by total number of affiliates. The network has an estimated national reach of 97.72% of all households in the United States (or 305,347,338 Americans with at least one television set).\n\nCurrently, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Delaware are the only U.S. states where ABC does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WABC-TV in the north half of the state and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV in the south; Rhode Island is served by New Bedford, Massachusetts-licensed WLNE, though outside of the transmitter, all other operations for the station are based in Providence; and Delaware is served by WPVI and Salisbury, Maryland, affiliate WMDT). ABC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Birmingham, Alabama (WBMA-LD), Lima, Ohio (WPNM-LP) and South Bend, Indiana (WBND-LD). In some markets, including the former two mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.\n\nThe network has the unusual distinction of having separately owned and operated affiliates which serve the same market in Tampa, Florida (WFTS-TV and WWSB), Lincoln, Nebraska (KLKN-TV and KHGI-TV), and Grand Rapids, Michigan (WZZM and WOTV), with an analogous situation arising in Kansas City, Missouri (KMBC-TV and KQTV). KQTV is licensed to St. Joseph, Missouri, which is designated by Nielsen as a separate market from Kansas City despite being located within of one another (though in the 2010s through digital subchannels, KQTV's competitor in the market, News-Press & Gazette Company, has established locally based affiliates of the other four major networks and Telemundo on three low-power stations to end St. Joseph's dependence on Kansas City; NPG itself proposed an acquisition of KQTV in April 2019, subject to FCC approval), while WWSB, KHGI and WOTV serve areas that do not receive an adequate signal from their market's primary ABC affiliate (in the case of WWSB, this dates back to when WTSP was Tampa's primary ABC affiliate prior to 1994, with the former being necessitated to serve the southern part of the Tampa market including the station's city of license, Sarasota, due to WTSP's transmitter being short-spaced to avoid interfering with the analog signal of Miami affiliate WPLG – which like WTSP, broadcast on VHF channel 10).\n\nThe Sinclair Broadcast Group is the largest operator of ABC stations by numerical total, owning or providing services to 28 full, primary ABC affiliates and two additional subchannel-only affiliates; Sinclair owns the largest ABC subchannel affiliate by market size, WABM-DT2/WDBB-DT2 in the Birmingham market, which serve as repeaters of WBMA-LD (which itself is also simulcast on a subchannel of former WBMA satellite WGWW, owned by Sinclair partner company Howard Stirk Holdings). The E. W. Scripps Company is the largest operator of ABC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 ABC-affiliated stations (including affiliates in larger markets such as Cleveland, Phoenix, Detroit and Denver), and through its ownership of Phoenix affiliate KNXV, Las Vegas affiliate KTNV-TV and Tucson affiliate KGUN-TV, it is the only provider of ABC programming for the majority of Arizona (outside the Yuma-El Centro market) and Southern Nevada. Scripps also owns and operates several ABC stations in the Mountain and Pacific time zones, including in Denver, San Diego, Bakersfield, California, and Boise, Idaho, and when combined with the ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles, Fresno, and San Francisco, the affiliations from the News-Press & Gazette Company in Santa Barbara, Palm Springs, Yuma-El Centro, and Colorado Springs-Pueblo, and Sinclair's affiliations in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, these four entities control the access of ABC network programming in most of the Western United States, particularly in terms of audience reach.\n\nAll of ABC's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates have had their own facilities and studios, but transverse entities have been created to produce national programming. As a result, television series were produced by ABC Circle Films beginning in 1962 and by Touchstone Television beginning in 1985, before Touchstone was reorganized as ABC Studios in February 2007. Since the 1950s, ABC has had two main production facilities: the ABC Television Center (now The Prospect Studios) on Prospect Avenue in Hollywood, California, shared with the operations of KABC-TV until 1999; and the ABC Television Center, East, a set of studios located throughout New York City.\n\nIn addition to the headquarters building on Riverside Drive, other ABC facilities in Burbank include a building at 3800 West Alameda, known as \"Burbank Center,\" which is primarily associated with Disney–ABC Television Group, and functions as the headquarters and broadcast center for Disney Junior, Disney Channel, Disney XD, FreeForm, as well as Radio Disney. Additionally, Disney Television Animation has a facility on Empire Avenue near the Hollywood Burbank Airport. In nearby Glendale, Disney/ABC also maintains the Grand Central Creative Campus, which houses other company subsidiaries, including the studios of KABC-TV and the Los Angeles bureau of ABC News.\n\nABC owns several facilities in New York grouped mainly on West 66th Street. The main set of facilities is on the corner of Columbus Avenue and West 66th Street. In total, ABC's facilities occupy a combined of the of the blocks they encompass. The aforementioned set includes:\n\nABC also owns the Times Square Studios at 1500 Broadway on land in Times Square owned by a development fund for the 42nd Street Project; opened in 1999, \"Good Morning America\" is broadcast from this particular facility. ABC News has premises a little further on West 66th Street, in a six-story building occupying a plot at 121–135 West End Avenue. The block of West 66th street between Central Park West and Columbus Ave which houses the ABC News building was renamed \"Peter Jennings Way\" in 2006 in honor of the recently deceased longtime ABC News chief anchor and anchor of \"World News Tonight\".\n\nOn July 9, 2018, the Walt Disney Company announced that it was selling its two West 66th Street campuses (except for the National Guard Amory) to Silverstein Properties and purchasing one square block of property in lower Manhattan to build a new New York based broadcast center.\n\nABC maintains several video on demand services for delayed viewing of the network's programming, including a traditional VOD service called ABC on Demand, which is carried on most traditional cable and IPTV providers. The Walt Disney Company is also a part-owner of Hulu (as part of a consortium that includes, among other parties, the respective parent companies of NBC and Fox, NBCUniversal and 21st Century Fox), and has offered full-length episodes of most of ABC's programming through the streaming service since July 6, 2009 (which are available for viewing on Hulu's website and mobile app, and since July 2016, through Yahoo! View as part of Hulu's spin-off of their free service to Yahoo), as part of an agreement reached in April that year that also allowed Disney to acquire a 27% ownership stake in Hulu.\n\nIn May 2013, ABC launched \"WatchABC\", a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network's existing streaming portal at ABC.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; in addition to providing full-length episodes of ABC programs, the service allows live programming streams of local ABC affiliates in select markets (the first such offering by a U.S. broadcast network). Similar to sister network ESPN's WatchESPN service, live streams of ABC stations are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers in certain markets. New York City O&O WABC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WPVI-TV were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service (with a free preview for non-subscribers through June 2013), with the six remaining ABC O&Os offering streams by the start of the 2013–14 season. Hearst Television also reached a deal to offer streams of its ABC affiliates (including stations in Boston, Kansas City, Milwaukee and West Palm Beach) on the service, though these stations are only available for live-streaming for DirecTV subscribers.\n\nIn November 2015, it was reported that ABC had been developing a slate of original digital series for the WatchABC service, internally codenamed \"ABC3\", with one series set to feature Iliza Shlesinger. In July 2016, ABC re-launched its streaming platforms, dropping the \"WatchABC\" brand, adding a streaming library of 38 classic ABC series, as well as introducing seven original short-form series under the blanket branding \"ABCd\".\n\nThe most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on the ABC app, Hulu and ABC on Demand the day after their original broadcast. In addition, ABC on Demand (like the video-on-demand television services provided by the other U.S. broadcast networks) disallows fast forwarding of accessed content. Restrictions implemented on January 7, 2014, restrict streaming of the most recent episode of any ABC program on Hulu and the ABC app until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing, with day-after-air streaming on either service limited to subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Comcast, Verizon FiOS and Time Warner Cable) using an ISP account via an authenticated user login.\n\nABC's network feeds are transmitted in 720p high definition, the native resolution format for The Walt Disney Company's U.S. television properties. However, most of Hearst Television's 16 ABC-affiliated stations transmit the network's programming in 1080i HD, while 11 other affiliates owned by various companies carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry ABC programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed ABC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nABC began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, ABC HD, on September 16, 2001, at the start of the 2001–02 season, with its scripted prime time series becoming the first shows to upgrade to the format. The network's slate of freshmen scripted series were broadcast in HD from their debuts, while all scripted series held over from the 2000–01 season were converted from standard-definition to high definition beginning that season.\n\nWith the 2011 cancellation of \"Supernanny\", \"\" became the only remaining program on the network's schedule that was broadcast in standard definition. All of the network's programming has been presented in HD since January 2012 (with the exception of certain holiday specials produced prior to 2005 – such as the \"Peanuts\" specials – which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD), when \"Extreme Makeover: Home Edition\" ended its run as a regular series and \"One Life to Live\" (which had been presented in standard definition since 2010) also ended its ABC run. The affiliate-syndicated Saturday morning E/I block \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\" is also broadcast in HD, and was the first children's program block on any U.S. broadcast network to feature programs available in the format upon its September 2011 debut.\n\nOn September 1, 2016, ABC began to use framing for all of most graphical imaging (primarily the network's logo bug, in-program promotions and generic closing credit sequences as well as sports telecasts, where the BottomLine and scoreboard elements now extend outside the 4:3 frame), requiring its stations and pay television providers to display its programming in a compulsory widescreen format, either in high definition or standard definition; with the change, some programs (such as \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"The Goldbergs\" and \"Quantico\") also began positioning their main on-screen credits outside the 4:3 aspect ratio. This left CBS and The CW as the last two major networks to continue to prefer 4:3 framing for graphics, with CBS converting to 16:9 framing effective September 24, 2018.\n\nThe ABC logo has evolved many times since the network's creation in 1943. The network's first logo, introduced in 1946, consisted of a television screen containing the letters \"T\" and \"V\", with a vertical \"ABC\" microphone in the center, referencing the network's roots in radio. When the ABC-UPT merger was finalized in 1953, the network introduced a new logo based on the seal of the Federal Communications Commission, with the letters \"ABC\" enclosed in a circular shield surmounted by the bald eagle. In 1957, just before the television network began its first color broadcasts, the ABC logo consisted of a tiny lowercase \"abc\" in the center of a large lowercase letter \"a\", a design known as the \"ABC Circle A\".\n\nIn 1962, graphic designer Paul Rand redesigned the ABC logo into its best-known (and current) form, with the lowercase letters \"abc\" enclosed in a single black circle. The new logo debuted on-air for ABC's promos at the start of the 1963–64 season. The letters are strongly reminiscent of the Bauhaus typeface designed by Herbert Bayer in the 1920s, but also share similarities with several other fonts, such as ITC Avant Garde and Horatio, and most closely resembling Chalet. The logo's simplicity made it easier to redesign and duplicate, which conferred a benefit for ABC (mostly before the advent of computer graphics). A color version of this logo was also developed around 1963, and animated as a brief 10-second intro to be shown before the then-small handful of network programs broadcast in color (similar to the NBC \"Laramie\" peacock intro used during that era). The \"a\" was rendered in red, the \"b\" in blue, and the \"c\" in green, against the same single black circle. A variant of this color logo, with the colored letters against a white circle, was also commonly used throughout the 1960s.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s saw the emergence of many graphical imaging packages for the network which based the logo's setting mainly on special lighting effects then under development including white, blue, pink, rainbow neon and glittering dotted lines. Among the \"ABC Circle\" logo's many variants was a 1977 ID sequence that featured a bubble on a black background representing the circle with glossy gold letters, and as such, was the first ABC identification card to have a three-dimensional appearance.\n\nIn 1983, for the 40th anniversary of the network's founding, ID sequences had the logo appear in a gold CGI design on a blue background, accompanied by the slogan \"That Special Feeling\" in a script font. Ten years later, in 1993, the \"ABC Circle\" logo reverted to its classic white-on-black color scheme, but with gloss effects on both the circle and the letters, and a bronze border surrounding the circle. The ABC logo first appeared as an on-screen bug in the 1993–94 season, appearing initially only for 60 seconds at the beginning of an act or segment, before appearing throughout programs (except during commercial breaks) beginning in the 1995–96 season; the respective iterations of the translucent logo bug were also incorporated within program promotions until the 2011–12 season.\n\nDuring the 1997–98 season, the network began using a minimalist graphical identity with a yellow and black motif, designed by Pittard Sullivan, featuring a small black-and-white \"ABC Circle\" logo on a yellow background (promotions during this time also featured a sequence of still photos of the stars of its programs during the timeslot card as well as the schedule sequence that began each night's prime time lineup). A new four-note theme tune was introduced alongside the package, based around the network's then-new \"We Love TV\" image campaign from the 1998–99 season, creating an audio signature on par with the NBC chimes, CBS' various three-note soundmarks (including the current version introduced in 1992) and the Fox Fanfare. The four-note signature has been updated with every television season thereafter (though variants of it remain in use during the production company vanity cards shown following the closing credits of most programs).\n\nIn 2000, ABC launched a web-based promotional campaign focused around its circle logo, also called \"the dot\", in which comic book character Little Dot prompted visitors to \"download the dot\", a program which would cause the ABC logo to fly around the screen and settle in the bottom-right corner. The network hired the Troika Design Group to design and produce its 2001–02 identity, which continued using the black-and-yellow coloring of the logo and featured dots and stripes in various promotional and identification spots.\n\nOn June 16, 2007, ABC began to phase in a new imaging campaign for the upcoming 2007–08 season, \"Start Here\". Also developed by Troika, the on-air design was intended to emphasize the availability of ABC content across multiple platforms (in particular, using a system of icons representing different devices, such as television, computers and mobile devices), and \"simplify and bring a lot more consistency and continuity to the visual representation of ABC\". The ABC logo was also significantly redesigned as part of the transition, with a glossy \"ball\" effect that was specifically designed for HD. On-air, the logo was accompanied by animated water and ribbon effects. Red ribbons were used to represent the entertainment division, while blue ribbons were used for ABC News.\n\nA revised version of the ABC logo was introduced for promotions for the 2013–14 season during the network's upfront presentation on May 14, 2013, and officially introduced on-air on May 30 (although some affiliates implemented the new design prior to then), as part of an overhaul of ABC's identity by design agency LoyalKaspar. The updated logo carries a simpler gloss design than the previous version, and contains lettering more closely resembling Paul Rand's original version of the circle logo. A new custom typeface inspired by the ABC logotype, \"ABC Modern\", was also created for use in advertising and other promotional materials. The logo was used in various color schemes, with a gold version used primarily for ABC's entertainment divisions, a red version used primarily for ESPN on ABC, steel blue and dark grey versions used primarily by ABC News, and all four colors used interchangeably in promotions. As part of a reimaging for the 2018–19 season, the color variants were dropped in favor of the dark grey version.\n\nThe Circle 7 logo, designed in 1962, is also commonly associated with ABC affiliates who broadcast on channel 7, including its flagship local stations WABC-TV (New York City), KABC-TV (Los Angeles), KGO-TV (San Francisco) and WLS-TV (Chicago). This logo was intended to be used somewhat interchangeably by these stations with the main circular network logo and has itself also become an iconic symbol of the ABC network. KGO was the first of the ABC-owned stations to use the Circle 7 logo, starting on August 27, 1962; by the end of the year, the other ABC-owned stations began using the logo, and have continued to do so since.\n\nThe first attempts to internationalize the ABC television network date back to the 1950s, after Leonard Goldenson, following the United Paramount Theatres model, tried to use on ABC the same strategies he had made in expanding UPT's theater operation to the international market. Leonard Goldenson said that ABC's first international activity was broadcasting the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953; CBS and NBC were delayed in covering the coronation due to flight delays. Goldenson tried international investing, having ABC invest in stations in the Latin American market, acquiring a 51% interest in a network covering Central America and in 1959 established program distributor Worldvision Enterprises Goldenson also cited interest in Japan in the early 1950s, acquiring a 5% stake in two new domestic networks, the Mainichi Broadcasting System in 1951 and Nihon Educational Television in 1957. Goldenson also invested in broadcasting properties in Beirut in the mid-1960s.\n\nThe idea was to create a network of wholly and partially owned channels, and affiliates to rebroadcast the network's programs. In 1959, this rerun activity was completed with program syndication, with ABC Films selling programs to networks not owned by ABC. The arrival of satellite television ended the need for ABC to hold interests in other countries; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties. As a result, ABC was forced to sell all of its interests in international networks, mainly in Japan and Latin America, in the 1970s.\n\nThe second period of international expansion is linked to that of the ESPN network in the 1990s, and policies enacted in the 2000s by Disney Media Networks (which included the expansion of several of the company's U.S.-based cable networks including Disney Channel and its spinoffs Toon Disney, Playhouse Disney and Jetix; although Disney also sold its 33% stake in European sports channel Eurosport for $155 million in June 2000). In contrast to Disney's other channels, ABC is broadcast in the United States, although the network's programming is syndicated in many countries. The policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on September 27 of that year, ABC announced the launch of ABC1, a free-to-air channel in the United Kingdom owned by the ABC Group. However, on September 8, 2007, Disney announced that it would discontinue ABC1 citing to the channel's inability to attain sustainable viewership. With ABC1's shutdown that October, the company's attempt to develop ABC International were discontinued.\n\nPrior to the ABC1 closure, on October 10, 2006, Disney–ABC Television Group entered into an agreement with satellite provider Dish TV to carry its ABC News Now channel in India. However, nothing has been heard from either parties thereafter.\n\nMost Canadians have access to at least one U.S.-based ABC affiliate, either over-the-air (in areas located within proximity to the Canada–United States border) or through a cable, satellite or IPTV provider, although most ABC programs are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission that allow pay television providers to replace an American station's signal with the feed of a Canadian broadcaster to protect domestic programming rights and advertising revenue.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "604350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=604350", "title": "ARD (broadcaster)", "text": "ARD (broadcaster)\n\nARD (; full name: \"Arbeitsgemeinschaft der öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunkanstalten der Bundesrepublik Deutschland\" – Working group of public broadcasters of the Federal Republic of Germany) is a joint organisation of Germany's regional public-service broadcasters. It was founded in 1950 in West Germany to represent the common interests of the new, decentralised, post-war broadcasting services – in particular the introduction of a joint television network.\n\nThe ARD has a budget of €6.9 billion and 22,612 employees. The budget comes primarily from a licence fee which every household, company and public institution are required by law to pay. For an ordinary household the fee is currently €17.50 per month. Households living on welfare do not have to pay the fee. The fees are not collected directly by the ARD, but by the Beitragsservice (formerly known as Gebühreneinzugszentrale GEZ), a common organisation of the ARD member broadcasters, the second public TV broadcaster ZDF, and Deutschlandradio.\n\nARD maintains and operates a national television network, called \"Das Erste\" (\"The First\") to differentiate it from ZDF, a.k.a. \"das Zweite\" (\"The Second\"), which started 1963, as a separate public TV-broadcaster. The ARD network began broadcasting on 31 October 1954 under the name of \"Deutsches Fernsehen\" (\"German Television\"), becoming \"Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen\" (\"First German Television\") with a corporate redesign in 1984; it adopted its current short name (\"Das Erste\") in 1994. ARD's programmes are aired over its own terrestrial television network, as well as on pay television.\n\nARD also produces two free-to-air channels (one and Tagesschau24) and participates in the production of Phoenix (current events, news and documentaries), KiKa (kids-oriented), 3sat (cultural-oriented) and arte (Franco-German cultural programming).\n\nARD's programming is produced by its regional members (see also Institutions and member organizations) (Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR), Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR), Radio Bremen, Rundfunk Berlin–Brandenburg (RBB), Saarländischer Rundfunk (SR), Südwestrundfunk (SWR) and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR)), which operate 54 regional and local radio stations and seven regional TV networks, some of which have opt outs at during the day. Deutsche Welle, Germany's international broadcaster, is also a member of ARD.\n\npublic-law broadcasting institutions means broadcasters which are not privately owned () and are not governmental radio or TV. ARD is not 'owned by' anybody, particularly not by \"Germany\" (meaning its government/federal state). ARD-members like BR (Bayerischer Rundfunk) are not owned by their \"Land\" (state and its government, here Bavaria), either. With the \"Rundfunkfreiheit\" (freedom of broadcasting), they have an independent position (within a legal framework).\n\nThe winning Allies of World War II determined that German radio after World War II would not broadcast the same propaganda as the pre-war \"Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft\" (\"Reich Broadcasting Company\"). A federal structure, the renunciation of state influence and the avoidance of economic dependence were to be the key of the radio and TV institutions under public law (\"\", public radio and television organisations). The legal form of the new entity was \"Anstalt des öffentlichen Rechts\" (\"Institution under Public Law\"), a non-government and nonprofit organisation with its own administration under the control of two commissions, the \"Rundfunkrat\" (Broadcasting Council, responsible for the programmed content) and the \"Verwaltungsrat\" (Administration Council, responsible for management and infrastructure), in which different stakeholders from German public life were represented.\n\nARD's founding members were Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk (NWDR), the station for the former British zone, Südwestfunk (SWF), the station in the French zone, and four stations located in the former American sector— Bayerischer Rundfunk (BR), Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR), Hessischer Rundfunk (HR), and Radio Bremen (RB). The new entity was financed by an obligatory fee which every German household with at least one radio receiver paid. Each station received the money collected in its state. Larger ARD members subsidised smaller ones up to a certain extent.\n\nIn 1947, American military governor Lucius D. Clay declared diversity of public opinion as the main aim of post-war media policy. Individuals aligned with the post-war Allied forces in their respective sectors of Germany had a local influence on local regional broadcasters. NDR cites the influence of Hugh Greene on the early years of their organisation.\n\nAfter the creation of individual broadcasting agencies for most German federal states these principles were further consolidated by \"Länder\" broadcasting laws, decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court (\"Bundesverfassungsgericht\") and state treaties between the \"Länder\". ARD members are thus (at least nominally) free of government influence and rely for only a small part of their income on advertising (1995: ten percent). They are financed mainly from licence fees from radio and TV owners, which are set through a complex political process. The mandated aim of the ARD corporations is not only to inform and to entertain, but also to encourage the integration of various parts of society and allow minorities a say in programming.\n\nIn the 1950s the ARD radio services became the major factor of the mass media system in West Germany. As early as 1952 the ARD radio stations had ten million listeners. However, the radio stations operated on a regional level, and it was only the development of a television umbrella that helped the ARD to establish itself nationwide. The broadcasting of a countrywide TV broadcast service was the goal of the ARD from the outset and the go-ahead for this was given at the end of 1952. The same year ARD was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union and the \"German sound archive\", now German Broadcasting Archive (DRA, Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv), was established as a joint facility of the ARD.\n\nIn 1955 the founding member \"NWDR\" (\"Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk\", English: \"North-West German Broadcasting\") split into today's NDR and WDR. The year before (1954) the smaller SFB was split off. The first daily news feature, the \"Tagesschau\", went on the air from Hamburg in 1952. The famous 8:00 pm chime and announcement \"\" (\"This is the first German television channel with the Tagesschau\") remains an ARD hallmark today. The broadcast attracts an average of 8 million viewers.\n\nAfter starting with a schedule of a mere two hours per-night, television became more widespread in Germany in the 1960s. Color broadcasts were introduced in 1967. Without competition from private broadcasters (other than the francophone Europe 1 and the multilingual RTL (Radio-Television Luxembourg) radio programs), the ARD stations made considerable progress in becoming modern and respected broadcasters. ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen, Second German Television), a second public television broadcaster with centralized national organization structure, began its programming in 1963, but ARD would encounter no private competition in Germany until 1984. The ARD stations have also been a significant force in German politics; such investigative news magazines as \"Monitor\" and \"Panorama\" still reach millions of viewers every week. The environmental movement increased in popularity during the 1980s largely as a result of the disclosures made by ARD.\n\nWhen private/commercial German-language broadcasters were admitted in Germany by federal law in the mid-1980s, ARD television made subtle changes, adapting somewhat by producing programs oriented to a larger audience for their national networks and shifting many cultural and news programs to the regional networks and to newly created niche channels.\n\nInformational television programs and the orientation of \"Deutschlandfunk\" (Germany's national public radio station, associated with, but not a member of the ARD) programs towards the GDR were of importance to the eventual collapse of the GDR. Established in 1974, the ARD bureau in East Berlin made ARD television the most important source of information for GDR citizens, eighty percent of whom could watch what they referred to as \"Westfernsehen\". Notwithstanding obstruction on the part of GDR authorities and the repeated expulsion of their correspondents, the ARD-Tagesschau and Deutschlandfunk transmitted reports about the Leipzig Monday Demonstrations (which started on 4 September 1989) as early as September 1989.\n\nAfter unification and the closure of the GDR television service, two new regional broadcasters were established in the East, becoming ARD members in 1992. These were originally the Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR, English: \"Central German Broadcasting\"), and Ostdeutscher Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB, English: \"East German Broadcasting Brandenburg\"). The existing NDR service expanded into the north-east, where it also covered Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The ORB service has since merged with the former Sender Freies Berlin (SFB, English \"Radio Free Berlin\") to become Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB, English: \"Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting\") in 2003.\n\nAnother merger took place between two member organisations of the ARD in 1998. The former Süddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR, English: \"Southern German Broadcasting\") and Südwestfunk (SWF, English: \"Southwestcast\") became Südwestrundfunk (SWR, English: \"Southwest Broadcasting\") on 1 October 1998.\n\nToday, ARD member stations usually produce their own radio programming. Some ARD member stations usually collaborate for common radio services (an example being Nordwestradio, a culture-oriented radio station co-produced by Radio Bremen and NDR). Most ARD stations, however, will have at least a news-oriented radio station, a classical-music station, a youth-oriented station, and a cultural station. At night some stations will relay common night programming produced on a rota system by the ARD stations themselves. There are four common night programming services: Nachtexpress/Radiowecker (light music), Nachtkonzert (classical music), Infonacht (all news) and Popnacht (pop music). Most services are on the FM broadcast band, though some services are also available on DAB.\n\nA similar network intended for national coverage is called Deutschlandradio, however Deutschlandradio is not an ARD member – instead Deutschlandradio is controlled by both ARD and ZDF. Deutschlandradio provides two terrestrial radio services: Deutschlandfunk (DLF), a news-oriented service, and Deutschlandfunk Kultur, a culture-oriented service. It also provides a science-orientated internet channel: \nDeutschlandfunk Nova.\n\nARD's best known radio station outside Germany is Deutsche Welle, which broadcasts its radio services around the world in many languages, mostly on analogue shortwave radio, online and FM partner stations. Deutsche Welle has no FM distribution in Germany.\n\n\"Archivradio\" is an ARD internet radio station which streams raw audio material from German sound archives, mainly the ARD radio archives and the DRA. The program is accompanied by a web portal run by the ARD-member SWR, with background information of the original sounds aired.\n\nThe main television channels of the ARD are the nationwide Das Erste and seven regional channels operated by the different regional broadcasting institutions. These channels were available on the analogue terrestrial transmitters until the shutdown of the analogue transmitters started in 2003. Das Erste and the third programmes, like the radio stations, are principally funded by licence fees, with a very limited amount of on-air advertising.\n\nDas Erste broadcasts nationwide 24 hours a day, although the schedule does include four and a half hours of joint programming with ZDF each weekday, in the form of the news programmes \"Morgenmagazin\" (on air 5.30–9.00) and \"Mittagsmagazin\" (13.00–14.00), which the two organizations take weekly turns to produce.\nAudience share (March 2008):12.5%, from 14–49 years 6.9%.\n\nThe regional members of ARD all, jointly (NDR/rb and SWR/SR) or separately, operate their own regional channels, known collectively as \"die Dritten\" (\"the Third Programmes\") – before recent rebranding, most of these stations had names like West 3 and Hessen 3. The schedules of these regional channels also include sub-regional opt-outs at certain times, in particular for local news.\n\nARD has two additional channels as part of their ARD Digital package:\n\nARD is also involved in several joint venture channels:\n\nThe international broadcaster Deutsche Welle also produces television services; however these services are mostly available via satellite.\n\nARD has 32 bureaux across the world, making it one of the world's largest news bureau networks worldwide. \n\nARD operates several other companies and institutions, sometimes jointly with ZDF:Degeto Film, a television rights trader and production company; the German Broadcasting Archive (DRA – Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv); the Institute for Broadcasting Technology (IRT – Institut für Rundfunktechnik), responsible for research and development; the Fee Collection Service (Beitragsservice), and others.\n\nARD is a supporter of the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband TV (HbbTV) initiative that is promoting and establishing an open European standard for hybrid set-top boxes for the reception of broadcast TV and broadband multimedia applications with a single user interface.\n\nAfter the ARD withdrew material critical of the Turkish president Erdogan, the magazine Der Spiegel compared this behaviour to the Politburo. \"The only thing that worries the delegates to the supervisory bodies was seen as the question whether the group they represent is treated with respect.\"\n\nTo get rid of the \"annoying image of state radio\", the magazine Der Spiegel recommends it would certainly be helpful to keep more distance from the government. \"..it's really hard to find people among those responsible for political reporting who do not find Angela Merkel quite wonderful and would like to share that with the audience every day.\"\n\nClaudia Schwartz from the Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported in February 2019 the ARD wanted to liven up the audience with morality. An internal manual from the \"Berkeley International Framing Institute\" was used in order to make ARD viewers consider their fees less as a compulsory contribution than as a kind of donation to a good cause. Claudia Schwartz commented: \"Self-congratulation in the best traditition of state radio one is inclined to write - if this word would not already have been prohibited for some time.\"\n\n\n\nThe \"Tagesschau\", produced by the ARD on a nightly basis, is available on the ARD website as a podcast (available as audio-only or as audio and video). Other audio programs from the ARD's members (e.g., BR, MDR) and Deutsche Welle are available as podcasts, through their respective websites.\n"}
{"id": "19344654", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19344654", "title": "BBC", "text": "BBC\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a British public service broadcaster. Its headquarters are at Broadcasting House in Westminster, London. It is the world's oldest national broadcaster, and the largest broadcaster in the world by number of employees. It employs over 22,000 staff in total, more than 16,000 of whom are in public sector broadcasting. The total number of staff is 35,402 when part-time, flexible, and fixed-contract staff are included.\n\nThe BBC is established under a Royal Charter and operates under its Agreement with the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Its work is funded principally by an annual television licence fee which is charged to all British households, companies, and organisations using any type of equipment to receive or record live television broadcasts and iPlayer catch-up. The fee is set by the British Government, agreed by Parliament, and used to fund the BBC's radio, TV, and online services covering the nations and regions of the UK. Since 1 April 2014, it has also funded the BBC World Service (launched in 1932 as the BBC Empire Service), which broadcasts in 28 languages and provides comprehensive TV, radio, and online services in Arabic and Persian.\n\nAround a quarter of BBC's revenue comes from its commercial subsidiary BBC Studios (formerly BBC Worldwide), which sells BBC programmes and services internationally and also distributes the BBC's international 24-hour English-language news services BBC World News, and from BBC.com, provided by BBC Global News Ltd. In 2009, the company was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in recognition of its international achievements.\n\nFrom its inception, through the Second World War (where its broadcasts helped to unite the nation), to the 21st century, the BBC has played a prominent role in British life and culture. It is also known colloquially as \"The Beeb\", \"Auntie\", or a combination of both (as \"Auntie Beeb\" or \"Auntie B\").\n\nBritain's first live public broadcast was made from the factory of Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company in Chelmsford in June 1920. It was sponsored by the \"Daily Mail\"s Lord Northcliffe and featured the famous Australian soprano Dame Nellie Melba. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio. However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the General Post Office (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.\n\nBut by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members. Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufactures, to be known as the British Broadcasting Company Ltd. John Reith, a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast. L. Stanton Jefferies was its first Director of Music. The company was to be financed by a royalty on the sale of BBC wireless receiving sets from approved domestic manufacturers. To this day, the BBC aims to follow the Reithian directive to \"inform, educate and entertain\".\n\nThe financial arrangements soon proved inadequate. Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets. By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the Sykes Committee. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufactures protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee. By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the 1926 general strike broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the Labour Party and delayed a peace appeal by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"Jerusalem\" signifying that England had been saved.\n\nWhile the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, Jean Seaton, Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\". Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.\n\nThe BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925–26) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith – newly knighted – was appointed its first Director General. To represent its purpose and (stated) values, the new corporation adopted the coat of arms, including the motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\".\n\nBritish radio audiences had little choice apart from the upscale programming of the BBC. Reith, an intensely moralistic executive, was in full charge. His goal was to broadcast \"All that is best in every department of human knowledge, endeavour and achievement... The preservation of a high moral tone is obviously of paramount importance.\" Reith succeeded in building a high wall against an American-style free-for-all in radio in which the goal was to attract the largest audiences and thereby secure the greatest advertising revenue. There was no paid advertising on the BBC; all the revenue came from a tax on receiving sets. Highbrow audiences, however, greatly enjoyed it. At a time when American, Australian and Canadian stations were drawing huge audiences cheering for their local teams with the broadcast of baseball, rugby and hockey, the BBC emphasized service for a national, rather than a regional audience. Boat races were well covered along with tennis and horse racing, but the BBC was reluctant to spend its severely limited air time on long football or cricket games, regardless of their popularity.\n\nJohn Reith and the BBC, with support from the Crown, determined the universal needs of the people of Britain and broadcast content according to these perceived standards. Reith effectively censored anything that he felt would be harmful, directly or indirectly. While recounting his time with the BBC in 1935, Raymond Postgate claims that BBC broadcasters were made to submit a draft of their potential broadcast for approval. It was expected that they tailored their content to accommodate the modest, church-going elderly or a member of the Clergy. Until 1928, entertainers broadcasting on the BBC, both singers and \"talkers\" were expected to avoid biblical quotations, Clerical impersonations and references, references to drink or Prohibition in America, vulgar and doubtful matter and political allusions. The BBC excluded popular foreign music and musicians from its broadcasts, while promoting British alternatives. On 5 March 1928, Stanley Baldwin, the Prime Minister, maintained the censorship of editorial opinions on public policy, but allowed the BBC to address matters of religious, political or industrial controversy. The resulting political \"talk series\", designed to inform England on political issues, were criticized by Members of Parliament, including Winston Churchill, David Lloyd George and Sir Austen Chamberlain. Those who opposed these chats claimed that they silence the opinions of those in Parliament who are not nominated by Party Leaders or Party Whips, thus stifling independent, non-official views. In October 1932, the policemen of the Metropolitan Police Federation marched in protest of a proposed pay cut. Fearing dissent within the police force and public support for the movement, the BBC censored its coverage of the events, only broadcasting official statements from the government.\n\nThroughout the 1930s, political broadcasts had been closely monitored by the BBC. In 1935, the BBC censored the broadcasts of Oswald Mosley and Harry Pollitt. Mosley was a leader of the British Union of Fascists, and Pollitt a leader of the Communist Party of Great Britain. They had been contracted to provide a series of five broadcasts on their party's politics. The BBC, in conjunction with The Foreign Office of Britain, first suspended this series and ultimately cancelled it without the notice of the public. Less radical politicians faced similar censorship. In 1938, Winston Churchill proposed a series of talks regarding British domestic and foreign politics and affairs but was similarly censored. The censorship of political discourse by the BBC was a precursor to the total shutdown of political debate that manifested over the BBC's wartime airwaves. The Foreign Office maintained that the public should not be aware of their role in the censorship. From 1935 to 1939, the BBC also attempted to unite the British Empire's radio waves, sending staff to Egypt, Palestine, Newfoundland, Jamaica, India, Canada and South Africa. Reith personally visited South Africa, lobbying for state run radio programs which was accepted by South African Parliament in 1936. A similar program was adopted in Canada. Through collaboration with these state run broadcasting centers, Reith left a legacy of cultural influence across the empire of Great Britain with his departure from the Corporation in 1938.\n\nThe success of broadcasting provoked animosities between the BBC and well established media such as theatres, concert halls and the recording industry. By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years ... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\" In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by Reginald Foort, who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by John Logie Baird. Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service (now named the BBC Television Service) started from Alexandra Palace in 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic 405 line Marconi-EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year.\n\nTelevision broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946, during the Second World War, and it was left to BBC Radio broadcasters such as Reginald Foort to keep the nation's spirits up. The BBC moved much of its radio operations out of London, initially to Bristol, and then to Bedford. Concerts were broadcast from the Corn Exchange; the Trinity Chapel in St Paul's Church, Bedford was the studio for the daily service from 1941 to 1945, and, in the darkest days of the war in 1941, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York came to St Paul's to broadcast to the UK and all parts of the world on the National Day of Prayer. BBC employees during the war included George Orwell who spent two years with the broadcaster.\n\nDuring his role as Prime Minister during the Second World War, Winston Churchill would deliver 33 major wartime speeches by radio, all of which were carried by the BBC within the UK. On 18 June 1940, French general Charles de Gaulle, in exile in London as the leader of the Free French, made a speech, broadcast by the BBC, urging the French people not to capitulate to the Nazis.\n\nIn 1938, John Reith and the British government, specifically the Ministry of Information which had been set up for WWII, designed a censorship apparatus for the inevitability of war. Due to the BBC's advancements in shortwave radio technology, the Corporation could broadcast across the world during World War II. Within Europe, the BBC European Service would gather intelligence and information regarding the current events of the war in English. Regional BBC workers, based on their regional geo-political climate, would then further censor the material their broadcasts would cover. Nothing was to be added outside of the preordained news items. For example, the BBC Polish Service was heavily censored due to fears of jeopardizing relations with the Soviet Union. Controversial topics, i.e. the contested Polish and Soviet border, the deportation of Polish citizens, the arrests of Polish Home Army members and the Katyn massacre, were not included in Polish broadcasts. American radio broadcasts were broadcast across Europe on BBC channels. This material also passed through the BBC's censorship office, which surveilled and edited American coverage of British affairs. By 1940, across all BBC broadcasts, music by composers from enemy nations was censored. In total, 99 German, 38 Austrian and 38 Italian composers were censored. The BBC argued that like the Italian or German languages, listeners would be irritated by the inclusion of enemy composers. Any potential broadcaster said to have pacifist, communist or fascist ideologies were not allowed on the BBC's airwaves.\n\nThere was a widely reported urban myth that, upon resumption of the BBC television service after the war, announcer Leslie Mitchell started by saying, \"As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted ...\" In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was Jasmine Bligh and the words said were \"Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh ... ?\" The European Broadcasting Union was formed on 12 February 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.\n\nCompetition to the BBC was introduced in 1955, with the commercial and independently operated television network of ITV. However, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist until 8 October 1973 when under the control of the newly renamed Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the UK's first Independent local radio station, LBC came on-air in the London area. As a result of the Pilkington Committee report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming, the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, BBC2, in 1964, renaming the existing service BBC1. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967, and was joined by BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405 line VHF transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.\nStarting in 1964, a series of pirate radio stations (starting with Radio Caroline) came on the air and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services. In response, the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. On 30 September 1967, the Light Programme was split into Radio 1 offering continuous \"Popular\" music and Radio 2 more \"Easy Listening\". The \"Third\" programme became Radio 3 offering classical music and cultural programming. The Home Service became Radio 4 offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays. As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967, including Radio London. In 1969, the BBC Enterprises department was formed to exploit BBC brands and programmes for commercial spin-off products. In 1979, it became a wholly owned limited company, BBC Enterprises Ltd.\n\nIn 1974, the BBC's teletext service, Ceefax, was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978, BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one. Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster Channel 4), especially on satellite television, cable television, and digital television services. In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of divestment by spinning off and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the Hulton Press Library, a photographic archive which had been acquired from the \"Picture Post\" magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by Getty Images. During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but wholly owned subsidiaries of the BBC, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as BBC Worldwide Ltd. In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd.\n\nThe BBC Research Department has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. The BBC was also responsible for the development of the NICAM stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: Radio 5 was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with Radio 5 Live to become a live radio station, following the success of the Radio 4 service to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, BBC News 24, a rolling news channel, launched on digital television services and the following year, BBC Choice launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed BBC Parliament. In 1999, BBC Knowledge launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched BBC Text digital teletext service, and on BBC Online. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.\n\nIn 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. BBC Knowledge was replaced by BBC Four and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. CBBC, which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and CBeebies, for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the CBBC Channel and CBeebies Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: 1Xtra, 6 Music and BBC7. BBC 1Xtra was a sister station to Radio 1 and specialised in modern black music, BBC 6 Music specialised in alternative music genres and BBC7 specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.\nThe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, BBC Choice was replaced by BBC Three, with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the BBC News Channel in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became BBC Radio 4 Extra in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on Radio 4. In 2008, another channel was launched, BBC Alba, a Scottish Gaelic service.\n\nDuring this decade, the corporation began to sell off a number of its operational divisions to private owners; BBC Broadcast was spun off as a separate company in 2002, and in 2005. it was sold off to Australian-based Macquarie Capital Alliance Group and Macquarie Bank Limited and rebranded Red Bee Media. The BBC's IT, telephony and broadcast technology were brought together as BBC Technology Ltd in 2001, and the division was later sold to the German company Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS). SIS was subsequently acquired from Siemens by the French company Atos. Further divestments included BBC Books (sold to Random House in 2006); BBC Outside Broadcasts Ltd (sold in 2008 to Satellite Information Services); Costumes and Wigs (stock sold in 2008 to Angels The Costumiers); and BBC Magazines (sold to Immediate Media Company in 2011). After the sales of OBs and costumes, the remainder of BBC Resources was reorganised as BBC Studios and Post Production, which continues today as a wholly owned subsidiary of the BBC.\n\nThe 2004 Hutton Inquiry and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC's journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, Greg Dyke. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the board meeting which led to Greg Dyke's resignation.\n\nUnlike the other departments of the BBC, the BBC World Service was funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.\n\nIn 2006, BBC HD launched as an experimental service, and became official in December 2007. The channel broadcast HD simulcasts of programmes on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Three and BBC Four as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD. In 2010, an HD simulcast of BBC One launched: BBC One HD. The channel uses HD versions of BBC One's schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD. The BBC HD channel closed in March 2013 and was replaced by BBC2 HD in the same month.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation. The plans included a reduction in posts of 2,500; including 1,800 redundancies, consolidating news operations, reducing programming output by 10% and selling off the flagship Television Centre building in London. These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions, who have threatened a series of strikes; however, the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in 2016. The same announcement revealed that the BBC would take on the full cost of running the BBC World Service and the BBC Monitoring service from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and partially finance the Welsh broadcaster S4C.\n\nFurther cuts were announced on 6 October 2011, so the BBC could reach a total reduction in their budget of 20%, following the licence fee freeze in October 2010, which included cutting staff by 2,000 and sending a further 1,000 to the MediaCityUK development in Salford, with BBC Three moving online only in 2016, the sharing of more programmes between stations and channels, sharing of radio news bulletins, more repeats in schedules, including the whole of BBC Two daytime and for some original programming to be reduced. BBC HD was closed on 26 March 2013, and replaced with an HD simulcast of BBC Two; however, flagship programmes, other channels and full funding for CBBC and CBeebies would be retained. Numerous BBC facilities have been sold off, including New Broadcasting House on Oxford Road in Manchester. Many major departments have been relocated to Broadcasting House and MediaCityUK, particularly since the closure of BBC Television Centre in March 2013. On 16 February 2016, the BBC Three television service was discontinued and replaced by a digital outlet under the same name, targeting its young adult audience with web series and other content.\n\nUnder the new royal charter instituted 2017, the corporation must publish an annual report to Ofcom, outlining its plans and public service obligations for the next year. In its 2017–18 report, released July 2017, the BBC announced plans to \"re-invent\" its output to better compete against commercial streaming services such as Netflix. These plans included increasing the diversity of its content on television and radio, a major increase in investments towards digital children's content, and plans to make larger investments in other nations of the United Kingdom besides England to \"rise to the challenge of better reflecting and representing a changing UK.\"\n\nThe BBC is a statutory corporation, independent from direct government intervention, with its activities being overseen from April 2017 by the BBC Board and regulated by Ofcom. The Chairman is Sir David Clementi.\n\nThe BBC operates under a Royal Charter. The current Charter came into effect on 1 January 2017 and runs until 31 December 2026. The 2017 charter abolished the BBC Trust and replaced it with external regulation by Ofcom, with governance by the BBC Board.\n\nUnder the Royal Charter, the BBC must obtain a licence from the Home Secretary. This licence is accompanied by an agreement which sets the terms and conditions under which the BBC is allowed to broadcast.\n\nThe BBC Board was formed in April 2017. It replaced the previous governing body, the BBC Trust, which in itself had replaced the Board of Governors in 2007. The Board sets the strategy for the corporation, assesses the performance of the BBC Executive Board in delivering the BBC's services, and appoints the Director-General. Regulation of the BBC is now the responsibility of Ofcom. The Board consists of the following members.\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the broadcaster. Consisting of senior managers of the BBC, the Committee meets once per month and is responsible for operational management and delivery of services within a framework set by the Board, and is chaired by the Director-General, currently Tony Hall.\n\nThe Director-General is chief executive and (from 1994) editor-in-chief.\n\nThe Corporation has the following in-house divisions covering the BBC's output and operations:\n\n\nThe BBC also operates a number of wholly owned commercial divisions:\n\nFrom as early as the 1930s until the 1990s, MI5, the British domestic intelligence service, engaged in vetting of applicants for BBC positions, a policy designed to keep out persons deemed subversive. In 1933, BBC executive Colonel Alan Dawnay began to meet with the head of MI5, Sir Vernon Kell, to informally trade information; from 1935, a formal arrangement was made wherein job applicants would be secretly vetted by MI5 for their political views (without their knowledge). The BBC took up a policy of denying any suggestion of such a relationship by the press (the existence of MI5 itself was not officially acknowledged until the Security Service Act 1989.\n\nThis relationship garnered wider public attention after an article by David Leigh and Paul Lashmar appeared in \"The Observer\" in August 1985, revealing that MI5 had been vetting appointments, running operations out of Room 105 in Broadcasting House. At the time of the exposé, the operation was being ran by Ronnie Stonham. A memo from 1984 revealed that blacklisted organizations included the far-left Communist Party of Great Britain, the Socialist Workers Party, the Workers Revolutionary Party and the Militant Tendency, as well as the far-right National Front and the British National Party. An association with one of these groups could result in a denial of a job application.\n\nIn October 1985, the BBC announced that it would stop the vetting process, except for a few people in top roles, as well as those in charge of Wartime Broadcasting Service emergency broadcasting (in event of a nuclear war) and staff in the BBC World Service. In 1990, following the Security Service Act 1989, vetting was further restricted to only those responsible for wartime broadcasting and those with access to secret government information. Michael Hodder, who succeeded Stonham, had the MI5 vetting files sent to the BBC Information and Archives in Reading, Berkshire.\n\nThe BBC has the second largest budget of any UK-based broadcaster with an operating expenditure of £4.722 billion in 2013/14 compared with £6.471 billion for British Sky Broadcasting in 2013/14 and £1.843 billion for ITV in the calendar year 2013.\n\nThe principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing £154.50 per year per household since April 2019. Such a licence is required to legally receive broadcast television across the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. No licence is required to own a television used for other means, or for sound only radio sets (though a separate licence for these was also required for non-TV households until 1971). The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. A discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets. A 50% discount is also offered to people who are registered blind or severely visually impaired, and the licence is completely free for any household containing anyone aged 75 or over. However, from June 2020, the licence fee will only be waived if over 75 and receiving pension credit. This caused much uproar in the British media in Summer 2019 when it was announced, with even the Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling the BBC to reverse it's decision, although the BBC resisted. As a result of the UK Government's recent spending review, an agreement has been reached between the government and the corporation in which the current licence fee will remain frozen at the current level until the Royal Charter is renewed at the beginning of 2017.\n\nThe BBC pursues its licence fee collection and enforcement under the trading name \"TV Licensing\". The revenue is collected privately by Capita, an outside agency, and is paid into the central government Consolidated Fund, a process defined in the Communications Act 2003. Funds are then allocated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Treasury and approved by Parliament via legislation. Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75-year-olds.\n\nThe licence fee is classified as a tax, and its evasion is a criminal offence. Since 1991, collection and enforcement of the licence fee has been the responsibility of the BBC in its role as TV Licensing Authority. Thus, the BBC is a major prosecuting authority in England and Wales and an investigating authority in the UK as a whole. The BBC carries out surveillance (mostly using subcontractors) on properties (under the auspices of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000) and may conduct searches of a property using a search warrant. According to the BBC, \"more than 204,000 people in the UK were caught watching TV without a licence during the first six months of 2012.\" Licence fee evasion makes up around one-tenth of all cases prosecuted in magistrates' courts.\n\nIncome from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years, with BBC Worldwide contributing some £145 million to the BBC's core public service business.\n\nAccording to the BBC's 2013/14 Annual Report, its total income was £5 billion (£5.066 billion), which can be broken down as follows:\n\nThe licence fee has, however, attracted criticism. It has been argued that in an age of multi-stream, multi-channel availability, an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate. The BBC's use of private sector company Capita Group to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised, especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments, or do not require a TV licence.\n\nThe BBC uses advertising campaigns to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee. Past campaigns have been criticised by Conservative MP Boris Johnson and former MP Ann Widdecombe for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying. Audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the BBC's comprehensive database. There are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee.\n\nThe majority of the BBC's commercial output comes from its commercial arm BBC Worldwide who sell programmes abroad and exploit key brands for merchandise. Of their 2012/13 sales, 27% were centred on the five key \"superbrands\" of \"Doctor Who\", \"Top Gear\", \"Strictly Come Dancing\" (known as \"Dancing with the Stars\" internationally), the BBC's archive of natural history programming (collected under the umbrella of BBC Earth) and the (now sold) travel guide brand Lonely Planet.<ref name=\"BBC Worldwide 2012/13 review\"></ref>\n\nThe following expenditure figures are from 2012/13<ref name=\"2012/13 annual report finance expenditure\"></ref> and show the expenditure of each service they are obliged to provide:\n\nA significantly large portion of the BBC's income is spent on the corporation's Television and Radio services with each service having a different budget based upon their content.\n\nBroadcasting House in Portland Place, London, is the official headquarters of the BBC. It is home to six of the ten BBC national radio networks, BBC Radio 1, BBC Radio 1xtra, BBC Asian Network, BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4, and BBC Radio 4 Extra. It is also the home of BBC News, which relocated to the building from BBC Television Centre in 2013. On the front of the building are statues of Prospero and Ariel, characters from William Shakespeare's play \"The Tempest\", sculpted by Eric Gill. Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002, and was completed in 2013.\n\nUntil it closed at the end of March 2013, BBC Television was based at BBC Television Centre, a purpose built television facility and the second built in the country located in White City, London. This facility has been host to a number of famous guests and programmes through the years, and its name and image is familiar with many British citizens. Nearby, the BBC White City complex contains numerous programme offices, housed in Centre House, the Media Centre and Broadcast Centre. It is in this area around Shepherd's Bush that the majority of BBC employees work.\n\nAs part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, the entire BBC News operation relocated from the News Centre at BBC Television Centre to the refurbished Broadcasting House to create what is being described as \"one of the world's largest live broadcast centres\". The BBC News Channel and BBC World News relocated to the premises in early 2013. Broadcasting House is now also home to most of the BBC's national radio stations, and the BBC World Service. The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post-war extensions to the building and construction of an extension designed by Sir Richard MacCormac of MJP Architects. This move will concentrate the BBC's London operations, allowing them to sell Television Centre, which is expected to be completed by 2016.\n\nIn addition to the scheme above, the BBC is in the process of making and producing more programmes outside London, involving production centres such as Belfast, Cardiff, Glasgow, Newcastle and, most notably, in Greater Manchester as part of the \"BBC North Project\" scheme where several major departments, including BBC North West, BBC Manchester, BBC Sport, BBC Children's, CBeebies, Radio 5 Live, BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, \"BBC Breakfast\", BBC Learning and the BBC Philharmonic have all moved from their previous locations in either London or New Broadcasting House, Manchester to the new 200-acre (80ha) MediaCityUK production facilities in Salford, that form part of the large BBC North Group division and will therefore become the biggest staffing operation outside London.\n\nAs well as the two main sites in London (Broadcasting House and White City), there are seven other important BBC production centres in the UK, mainly specialising in different productions. Broadcasting House Cardiff, has been home to BBC Cymru Wales, which specialises in drama production. Open since October 2011, and containing 7 new studios, Roath Lock is notable as the home of productions such as \"Doctor Who\" and \"Casualty\". Broadcasting House Belfast, home to BBC Northern Ireland, specialises in original drama and comedy, and has taken part in many co-productions with independent companies and notably with RTÉ in the Republic of Ireland. BBC Scotland, based in Pacific Quay, Glasgow is a large producer of programmes for the network, including several quiz shows. In England, the larger regions also produce some programming.\n\nPreviously, the largest hub of BBC programming from the regions is BBC North West. At present they produce all Religious and Ethical programmes on the BBC, as well as other programmes such as \"A Question of Sport\". However, this is to be merged and expanded under the BBC North project, which involved the region moving from New Broadcasting House, Manchester, to MediaCityUK. BBC Midlands, based at The Mailbox in Birmingham, also produces drama and contains the headquarters for the English regions and the BBC's daytime output. Other production centres include Broadcasting House Bristol, home of BBC West and famously the BBC Natural History Unit and to a lesser extent, Quarry Hill in Leeds, home of BBC Yorkshire. There are also many smaller local and regional studios throughout the UK, operating the BBC regional television services and the BBC Local Radio stations.\n\nThe BBC also operates several news gathering centres in various locations around the world, which provide news coverage of that region to the national and international news operations.\n\nIn 2004, the BBC contracted out its former BBC Technology division to the German engineering and electronics company Siemens IT Solutions and Services (SIS), outsourcing its IT, telephony and broadcast technology systems. When Atos Origin acquired the SIS division from Siemens in December 2010 for €850 million (£720m), the BBC support contract also passed to Atos, and in July 2011, the BBC announced to staff that its technology support would become an Atos service. Siemens staff working on the BBC contract were transferred to Atos and BBC technology systems (including the BBC website) are now managed by Atos. In 2011, the BBC's Chief Financial Officer Zarin Patel stated to the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee that, following criticism of the BBC's management of major IT projects with Siemens (such as the Digital Media Initiative), the BBC partnership with Atos would be instrumental in achieving cost savings of around £64 million as part of the BBC's \"Delivering Quality First\" programme. In 2012, the BBC's Chief Technology Officer, John Linwood, expressed confidence in service improvements to the BBC's technology provision brought about by Atos. He also stated that supplier accountability had been strengthened following some high-profile technology failures which had taken place during the partnership with Siemens.\n\nThe BBC operates several television channels in the UK. BBC One and BBC Two are the flagship television channels; others are BBC Four, BBC News, BBC Parliament, and two children's channels, CBBC and CBeebies. Digital television is now entrenched in the UK, with analogue transmission completely phased out . It also operates the internet television service BBC Three, which ceased broadcasting as a linear television channel in February 2016.\nBBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt-outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming. These variations are more pronounced in the BBC \"Nations\", i.e. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales, where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two, and where programme schedules can vary greatly from that of the network. BBC Two variations exist in the Nations; however, English regions today rarely have the option to opt out as regional programming now only exists on BBC One. BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964, then carry a small-scale regular colour service from 1967. BBC One would follow in November 1969.\n\nA new Scottish Gaelic television channel, BBC Alba, was launched in September 2008. It is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland. The service was initially only available via satellite but since June 2011 has been available to viewers in Scotland on Freeview and cable television.\n\nThe BBC currently operates HD simulcasts of all its nationwide channels with the exception of BBC Parliament. Until 26 March 2013, a separate channel called BBC HD was available, in place of BBC Two HD. It launched on 9 June 2006, following a 12-month trial of the broadcasts. It became a proper channel in 2007, and screened HD programmes as simulcasts of the main network, or as repeats. The corporation has been producing programmes in the format for many years, and stated that it hoped to produce 100% of new programmes in HDTV by 2010. On 3 November 2010, a high-definition simulcast of BBC One was launched, entitled BBC One HD, and BBC Two HD launched on 26 March 2013, replacing BBC HD.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the BBC channels are available in a number of ways. In these countries digital and cable operators carry a range of BBC channels. These include BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four and BBC World News, although viewers in the Republic of Ireland may receive BBC services via overspill from transmitters in Northern Ireland or Wales, or via \"deflectors\"—transmitters in the Republic which rebroadcast broadcasts from the UK, received off-air, or from digital satellite.\n\nSince 1975, the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), allowing members of UK military serving abroad to watch them on four dedicated TV channels. From 27 March 2013, BFBS will carry versions of BBC One and BBC Two, which will include children's programming from CBBC, as well as carrying programming from BBC Three on a new channel called BFBS Extra.\n\nSince 2008, all the BBC channels are available to watch online through the BBC iPlayer service. This online streaming ability came about following experiments with live streaming, involving streaming certain channels in the UK.\n\nIn February 2014, Director-General Tony Hall announced that the corporation needed to save £100 million. In March 2014, the BBC confirmed plans for BBC Three to become an internet-only channel.\n\nIn December 2012, the BBC completed a digitisation exercise, scanning the listings of all BBC programmes from an entire run of about 4,500 copies of the \"Radio Times\" magazine from the first, 1923, issue to 2009 (later listings already being held electronically), the \"BBC Genome project\", with a view to creating an online database of its programme output. An earlier ten months of listings are to be obtained from other sources. They identified around five million programmes, involving 8.5 million actors, presenters, writers and technical staff. The Genome project was opened to public access on 15 October 2014, with corrections to OCR errors and changes to advertised schedules being crowdsourced.\n\nThe BBC has ten radio stations serving the whole of the UK, a further six stations in the \"national regions\" (Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland), and 40 other local stations serving defined areas of England. Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on FM and/or AM as well as on DAB and online. These are BBC Radio 1, offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; BBC Radio 2, playing Adult contemporary, country and soul music amongst many other genres; BBC Radio 3, presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; BBC Radio 4, focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and BBC Radio 5 Live, broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.\n\nIn addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. BBC Radio 1Xtra sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. BBC Radio 6 Music offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.\n\nBBC Radio 7, later renamed BBC Radio 4 Extra, provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as \"Ambridge Extra\", and \"Desert Island Discs revisited\". The final station is the BBC Asian Network, providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on Medium Wave frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 BBC Local Radio stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. BBC Radio Bristol), county or region (e.g. BBC Three Counties Radio), or geographical area (e.g. BBC Radio Solent covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are BBC Radio Wales (in English), BBC Radio Cymru (in Welsh), BBC Radio Scotland (in English), BBC Radio nan Gaidheal (in Scottish Gaelic), BBC Radio Ulster, and BBC Radio Foyle, the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these Crown dependencies are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations – BBC Guernsey and BBC Radio Jersey. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, Manx Radio, which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from television licence fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally. This is the subject of some controversy in the Isle of Man since, as well as having no BBC Local Radio service, the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by BBC Channel Islands.\n\nFor a worldwide audience, the BBC World Service provides news, current affairs and information in 28 languages, including English, around the world and is available in over 150 capital cities. It is broadcast worldwide on shortwave radio, DAB and online and has an estimated weekly audience of 192 million, and its websites have an audience of 38 million people per week. Since 2005, it is also available on DAB in the UK, a step not taken before, due to the way it is funded. The service is funded by a Parliamentary Grant-in-Aid, administered by the Foreign Office; however, following the Government's spending review in 2011, this funding will cease, and it will be funded for the first time through the Licence fee. In recent years, some services of the World Service have been reduced; the Thai service ended in 2006, as did the Eastern European languages, with resources diverted instead into the new BBC Arabic Television.\n\nHistorically, the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster based in the UK mainland until 1967, when University Radio York (URY), then under the name \"Radio York\", was launched as the first, and now oldest, legal independent radio station in the country. However, the BBC did not enjoy a complete monopoly before this as several Continental stations, such as Radio Luxembourg, had broadcast programmes in English to Britain since the 1930s and the Isle of Man-based Manx Radio began in 1964. Today, despite the advent of commercial radio, BBC radio stations remain among the most listened to in the country, with Radio 2 having the largest audience share (up to 16.8% in 2011–12) and Radios 1 and 4 ranked second and third in terms of weekly reach.\n\nBBC programming is also available to other services and in other countries. Since 1943, the BBC has provided radio programming to the British Forces Broadcasting Service, which broadcasts in countries where British troops are stationed. BBC Radio 1 is also carried in the United States and Canada on Sirius XM Radio (online streaming only).\n\nThe BBC is a patron of The Radio Academy.\n\nBBC News is the largest broadcast news gathering operation in the world, providing services to BBC domestic radio as well as television networks such as the BBC News, BBC Parliament and BBC World News. In addition to this, news stories are available on the BBC Red Button service and BBC News Online. In addition to this, the BBC has been developing new ways to access BBC News, as a result has launched the service on BBC Mobile, making it accessible to mobile phones and PDAs, as well as developing alerts by e-mail, digital television, and on computers through a desktop alert.\n\nRatings figures suggest that during major incidents such as the 7 July 2005 London bombings or royal events, the UK audience overwhelmingly turns to the BBC's coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals.\nOn 7 July 2005, the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on London's public transport system, the BBC Online website recorded an all time bandwidth peak of 11 Gb/s at 12.00 on 7 July. BBC News received some 1 billion total hits on the day of the event (including all images, text and HTML), serving some 5.5 terabytes of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000 page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the 2012 Olympics being awarded to London caused a peak of around 5 Gbit/s. The previous all-time high at BBC Online was caused by the announcement of the Michael Jackson verdict, which used 7.2 Gbit/s.\n\nThe BBC's online presence includes a comprehensive news website and archive. The BBC's first official online service was the BBC Networking Club, which was launched on 11 May 1994. The service was subsequently relaunched as BBC Online in 1997, before being renamed BBCi, then bbc.co.uk, before it was rebranded back as BBC Online. The website is funded by the Licence fee, but uses GeoIP technology, allowing advertisements to be carried on the site when viewed outside of the UK. The BBC claims the site to be \"Europe's most popular content-based site\" and states that 13.2 million people in the UK visit the site's more than two million pages each day. In 2017 \"BBC Online\" was among the ten most cited sources in the English Wikipedia. According to Alexa's TrafficRank system, in September 2019 BBC Online was ranked 114 in the world, and 6 in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe centre of the website is the Homepage, which features a modular layout. Users can choose which modules, and which information, is displayed on their homepage, allowing the user to customise it. This system was first launched in December 2007, becoming permanent in February 2008, and has undergone a few aesthetical changes since then. The Homepage then has links to other micro-sites, such as BBC News Online, Sport, Weather, TV and Radio. As part of the site, every programme on BBC Television or Radio is given its own page, with bigger programmes getting their own micro-site, and as a result it is often common for viewers and listeners to be told website addresses (URLs) for the programme website.\n\nAnother large part of the site also allows users to watch and listen to most Television and Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using the BBC iPlayer platform, which launched on 27 July 2007, and initially used peer-to-peer and DRM technology to deliver both radio and TV content of the last seven days for offline use for up to 30 days, since then video is now streamed directly. Also, through participation in the Creative Archive Licence group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.\n\nThe BBC has often included learning as part of its online service, running services such as BBC Jam, Learning Zone Class Clips and also runs services such as BBC WebWise and First Click which are designed to teach people how to use the internet. BBC Jam was a free online service, delivered through broadband and narrowband connections, providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school. Initial content was made available in January 2006; however, BBC Jam was suspended on 20 March 2007 due to allegations made to the European Commission that it was damaging the interests of the commercial sector of the industry.\n\nIn recent years, some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that BBC Online receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on BBC Online. Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on BBC Online should be reduced—either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site. In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. BBC Online will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.)\nPart of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.\n\nOn 26 February 2010, \"The Times\" claimed that Mark Thompson, Director General of the BBC, proposed that the BBC's web output should be cut by 50%, with online staff numbers and budgets reduced by 25% in a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room. On 2 March 2010, the BBC reported that it will cut its website spending by 25% and close BBC 6 Music and Asian Network, as part of Mark Thompson's plans to make \"a smaller, fitter BBC for the digital age\".\n\nBBC Red Button is the brand name for the BBC's interactive digital television services, which are available through Freeview (digital terrestrial), as well as Freesat, Sky (satellite), and Virgin Media (cable). Unlike Ceefax, the service's analogue counterpart, BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel. The service carries News, Weather and Sport 24 hours a day, but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time. Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows, to give, voice and vote on opinions to issues, as used alongside programmes such as \"Question Time\". At some points in the year, when multiple sporting events occur, some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch. Frequently, other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time, such as the broadcast of the \"Doctor Who\" animated episode \"Dreamland\" in November 2009.\n\nThe BBC employs 5 staff orchestras, a professional choir, and supports two amateur choruses, based in BBC venues across the UK; the BBC Symphony Orchestra, the BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus based in London, the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra in Glasgow, the BBC Philharmonic in Salford, the BBC Concert Orchestra based in Watford, and the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and BBC National Chorus of Wales in Cardiff. It also buys a selected number of broadcasts from the Ulster Orchestra in Belfast and the BBC Big Band.\n\nThe BBC Proms have been produced by the BBC every year since 1927, stepping in to fund the popular classical music festival when music publishers Chappell and Co withdrew their support. In 1930, the newly-formed BBC Symphony Orchestra gave all 49 Proms, and have performed at every Last Night of the Proms since then. Nowadays, the BBC's orchestras and choirs are the backbone of the Proms, giving around 40%–50% of all performances each season.\n\nMany famous musicians of every genre have played at the BBC, such as The Beatles (\"The Beatles Live at the BBC\" is one of their many albums). The BBC is also responsible for the broadcast of Glastonbury Festival, Reading Festival and United Kingdom coverage of the Eurovision Song Contest, a show with which the broadcaster has been associated for over 60 years. The BBC also operates the division of BBC Audiobooks sometimes found in association with Chivers Audiobooks.\n\nThe BBC operates other ventures in addition to their broadcasting arm. In addition to broadcasting output on television and radio, some programmes are also displayed on the BBC Big Screens located in several central-city locations. The BBC and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office also jointly run BBC Monitoring, which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide. The BBC also developed several computers throughout the 1980s, most notably the BBC Micro, which ran alongside the corporation's educational aims and programming.\n\nIn 1951, in conjunction with Oxford University Press the BBC published \"The BBC Hymn Book\" which was intended to be used by radio listeners to follow hymns being broadcast. The book was published both with and without music, the music edition being entitled \"The BBC Hymn Book with Music\". The book contained 542 popular hymns.\n\nThe BBC provided the world's first teletext service called Ceefax (near-homonymous with \"See Facts\") on 23 September 1974 until 23 October 2012 on the BBC 1 analogue channel then later on BBC 2. It showed informational pages such as News, Sport and the Weather. on New Year's Eve in 1974, competition from ITV's Oracle tried to compete with Ceefax. Oracle closed on New Year's Eve, 1992. During its lifetime it attracted millions of viewers, right up to 2012, prior to the digital switchover in the United Kingdom. It ceased transmission at 23:32:19 BST on 23 October 2012 after 38 years. Since then, the BBC's Red Button Service has provided a digital-like information system that replaced Ceefax.\n\nIn 2016, the BBC, in partnership with fellow UK Broadcasters ITV and Channel 4 (who later withdrew from the project), set up 'project kangaroo' to develop an international online streaming service to rival services such as Netflix and Hulu. During the development stages 'Britflix' was touted as a potential name. However, the service eventually launched as BritBox in March 2017. The online platform shows a catalogue of classic BBC and ITV shows, as well as making a number of programmes available shortly after their UK broadcast. , BritBox is available in the United States and Canada with the potential availability for new markets in the future, including the UK by late 2019. In October 2019, BritBox was released in its testing phase in the UK.\n\nBBC Studios (formerly BBC Worldwide) is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC, responsible for the commercial exploitation of BBC programmes and other properties, including a number of television stations throughout the world. It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.\n\nThe company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel BBC Entertainment shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Studios channels BBC America and BBC Canada (Joint venture with Corus Entertainment) showing similar programming in the North America region and BBC UKTV in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international CBeebies channel and BBC Kids, a joint venture with Knowledge Network Corporation, which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels BBC Knowledge, broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and BBC Lifestyle, broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Studios runs an international version of the channel BBC HD, and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.\n\nBBC Studios also distributes the 24-hour international news channel BBC World News. The station is separate from BBC Studios to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Studios. The channel itself is the oldest surviving entity of its kind, and has 50 foreign news bureaus and correspondents in nearly all countries in the world. As officially surveyed, it is available to more than 294 million households, significantly more than CNN's estimated 200 million.\n\nIn addition to these international channels, BBC Studios also owns the UKTV network of seven channels. These channels contain BBC archive programming to be rebroadcast on their respective channels: Alibi, crime dramas; Dave (slogan: \"The Home of Witty Banter\"); Drama, drama, launched in 2013; Eden, nature; Gold, comedy; W, Entertainment; and Yesterday, history programming.\n\nIn addition to these channels, many BBC programmes are sold via BBC Studios to foreign television stations with comedy, documentaries and historical drama productions being the most popular. In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many Public Broadcasting Service stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as \"EastEnders\", and in New Zealand on TVNZ 1.\n\nIn addition to programming, BBC Studios produces material to accompany programmes. The company maintained the publishing arm of the BBC, BBC Magazines, which published the \"Radio Times\" as well as a number of magazines that support BBC programming such as \"BBC Top Gear\", \"BBC Good Food\", \"BBC Sky at Night\", \"BBC History\", \"BBC Wildlife\" and \"BBC Music\". BBC Magazines was sold to Exponent Private Equity in 2011, which merged it with Origin Publishing (previously owned by BBC Worldwide between 2004 and 2006) to form Immediate Media Company.\n\nBBC Studios also publishes books, to accompany programmes such as \"Doctor Who\" under the BBC Books brand, a publishing imprint majority owned by Random House. Soundtrack albums, talking books and sections of radio broadcasts are also sold under the brand BBC Records, with DVDs also being sold and licensed in large quantities to consumers both in the UK and abroad under the 2 Entertain brand. Archive programming and classical music recordings are sold under the brand BBC Legends.\n\nUntil the development, popularisation, and domination of television, radio was the broadcast medium upon which people in the United Kingdom relied. It \"reached into every home in the land, and simultaneously united the nation, an important factor during the Second World War\". The BBC introduced the world's first \"high-definition\" 405-line television service in 1936. It suspended its television service during the Second World War and until 1946, but remained the only television broadcaster in the UK until 1955, when Independent Television (ITV) began operating. This heralded the transformation of television into a popular and dominant medium. Nevertheless, \"throughout the 1950s radio still remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy\". Further, the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968 (when URY obtained their first licence).\nDespite the advent of commercial television and radio, with competition from ITV, Channel 4 and Sky, the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for mass audiences. However, the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama, documentaries, current affairs, entertainment, and sport. Examples cited include the television series \"Civilisation\", \"Doctor Who\", \"I, Claudius\", \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"Pot Black\", and \"Tonight\", but other examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC's entries in the British Film Institute's 2000 list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, with the BBC's acclaimed 1970s sitcom \"Fawlty Towers\" (featuring John Cleese as Basil Fawlty) topping the list. \"Top of the Pops\", the world's longest running weekly music show, first aired in January 1964, with The Rolling Stones the first to perform on it. Some BBC shows have had a direct impact on society. For example, \"The Great British Bake Off\" is credited with reinvigorating interest in baking throughout the UK, with stores reporting sharp rises in sales of baking ingredients and accessories. The export of BBC programmes both through services like the BBC World Service and BBC World News, as well as through the channels operated by BBC Worldwide, means that audiences can consume BBC productions worldwide.\n\nThe term \"BBC English\" was used as an alternative name for Received Pronunciation, and the \"English Pronouncing Dictionary\" uses the term \"BBC Pronunciation\" to label its recommendations. However, the BBC itself now makes more use of regional accents in order to reflect the diversity of the UK, while continuing to expect clarity and fluency of its presenters. From its \"starchy\" beginnings, the BBC has also become more inclusive, and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities, because they all pay the licence fee.\n\nOlder domestic UK audiences often refer to the BBC as \"the Beeb\", a nickname originally coined by Peter Sellers on \"The Goon Show\" in the 1950s, when he referred to the \"Beeb Beeb Ceeb\". It was then borrowed, shortened and popularised by radio DJ Kenny Everett. David Bowie's recording sessions at the BBC was released as \"Bowie at the Beeb\", while Queen's recording sessions with the BBC was released as \"At the Beeb\". Another nickname, now less commonly used, is \"Auntie\", said to originate from the old-fashioned \"Auntie knows best\" attitude, or the idea of aunties and uncles who are present in the background of one's life (but possibly a reference to the \"aunties\" and \"uncles\" who presented children's programmes in the early days) in the days when John Reith, the BBC's first director general, was in charge. The term “Auntie” for the BBC is often credited to radio disc jockey Jack Jackson. To celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the BBC the song \"Auntie\" was released in 1972. The two nicknames have also been used together as \"Auntie Beeb\".\n\nThroughout its existence, The BBC has faced numerous accusations regarding many topics: the Iraq war, politics, ethics and religion, as well as funding and staffing. It also has been involved in numerous controversies because of its coverage of specific news stories and programming. In October 2014, the BBC Trust issued the \"BBC complaints framework\", outlining complaints and appeals procedures. However, the regulatory oversight of the BBC may be transferred to OFCOM. The British \"House of Commons Select Committee on Culture Media and Sport\" recommended in its report \"The Future of the BBC\", that OFCOM should become the final arbiter of complaints made about the BBC.\n\nThe BBC has long faced accusations from conservatives of liberal and left-wing bias. Accusations of a bias against the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party were often made against the BBC by members of that government, with Margaret Thatcher herself considering the broadcaster's news coverage to be biased and irresponsible. In 2011, Peter Sissons, a main news presenter at the BBC from 1989—2009, said that \"at the core of the BBC, in its very DNA, is a way of thinking that is firmly of the Left\". Another BBC presenter, Andrew Marr, commented that \"the BBC is not impartial or neutral. It has a liberal bias, not so much a party-political bias. It is better expressed as a cultural liberal bias.\" Former BBC director Roger Mosey classified it as \"liberal defensive.\"\n\nConversely, writing for \"The Guardian\", the left-wing columnist Owen Jones stated \"the truth is the BBC is stacked full of rightwingers,\" and he cited as an example of bias its employment of \"ultra-Thatcherite\" Andrew Neil as a politics presenter. Paul Mason, the former Economics Editor of the BBC's \"Newsnight\" programme, criticised the BBC as \"unionist\" in relation to its coverage of the Scottish independence referendum campaign and said its senior employees tended to be of a \"neo-liberal\" point of view. The BBC has also been characterised as a pro-monarchist institution. The BBC was accused of propaganda by conservative journalist and author Toby Young due to what he believed to be an anti-Brexit approach, which included a day of live programming on migration.\n\nA 2018 opinion poll by BMG Research found that 40% of the British public think that the BBC is politically partisan, with a nearly even split between those that believe it leans to the left or right.\n\nIn 2008, the BBC was criticised by some for referring to the men who carried out the November 2008 Mumbai attacks as \"gunmen\" rather than \"terrorists\". In protest against the use of the word \"gunmen\" by the BBC, journalist Mobashar Jawed \"M.J.\" Akbar refused to take part in an interview following the Mumbai terror attacks, and criticised the BBC's reportage of the incident. British parliamentarian Stephen Pound has supported these claims, referring to the BBC's whitewashing of the terror attacks as \"the worst sort of mealy mouthed posturing. It is desperation to avoid causing offence which ultimately causes more offence to everyone.\"\n\nA BBC World Service newsreader who presented a daily show produced for Kyrgyzstan was claimed to have participated in an opposition movement with the goal of overthrowing the government led by president Kurmanbek Bakiyev. The BBC presenter resigned from his post in 2010 once the allegations of his participation in the revolution became public.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37653", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37653", "title": "CBS", "text": "CBS\n\nCBS (an initialism of the network's former name, the Columbia Broadcasting System) is an American English-language commercial broadcast television and radio network that is the flagship property of the CBS Entertainment Group division of ViacomCBS. The company is headquartered at the CBS Building in New York City with major production facilities and operations in New York City (at the CBS Broadcast Center) and Los Angeles (at CBS Television City and the CBS Studio Center).\n\nCBS is sometimes referred to as the Eye Network, in reference to the company's trademark symbol, in use since 1951. It has also been called the \"Tiffany Network\", alluding to the perceived high quality of CBS programming during the tenure of William S. Paley. It can also refer to some of CBS's first demonstrations of color television, which were held in a former Tiffany & Co. building in New York City in 1950.\n\nThe network has its origins in United Independent Broadcasters Inc., a collection of 16 radio stations purchased by Paley in 1928 and renamed the Columbia Broadcasting System. Under Paley's guidance, CBS would first become one of the largest radio networks in the United States, and eventually one of the Big Three American broadcast television networks. In 1974 CBS dropped its former full name and became known simply as CBS, Inc. The Westinghouse Electric Corporation acquired the network in 1995, renamed its corporate entity to the current CBS Broadcasting, Inc. in 1997, and eventually adopted the name of the company it had acquired to become CBS Corporation. In 2000 CBS came under the control of the first Viacom, which was formed as a spin-off of CBS in 1971. In late 2005, Viacom split itself into two separate companies and re-established CBS Corporation through the spin-off of its broadcast television, radio, and select cable television and non-broadcasting assets, with the CBS television network at its core. CBS Corporation was controlled by Sumner Redstone through National Amusements, which also controlled the second Viacom until December 4, 2019, when the two separated companies agreed to re-merge to become the new single entity known as ViacomCBS.\n\nCBS formerly operated the CBS Radio network until 2017, when it merged its radio division with Entercom. Prior to then, CBS Radio mainly provided news and features content for its portfolio owned-and-operated radio stations in large and mid-sized markets, and affiliated radio stations in various other markets. While CBS Corporation shareholders own a 72% stake in Entercom, CBS no longer owns or operates any radio stations directly, though CBS still provides radio news broadcasts to its radio affiliates and the new owners of its former radio stations and licenses the rights to use CBS trademarks under a long-term contract. The television network has more than 240 owned-and-operated, and affiliated television stations throughout the United States; some of them are also available in Canada via pay-television providers or in border areas over-the-air. The company ranked 197th on the 2018 Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.\n\nThe origins of CBS date back to January 27, 1927, with the creation of the \"United Independent Broadcasters\" network in Chicago by New York City talent-agent Arthur Judson. The fledgling network soon needed additional investors though, and the Columbia Phonograph Company, manufacturers of Columbia Records, rescued it in April 1927; as a result, the network was renamed the \"Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System\" on September 18 of that year. Columbia Phonographic went on the air on September 18, 1927, with a presentation by the Howard L. Barlow Orchestra from flagship station WOR in Newark, New Jersey, and fifteen affiliates.\n\nOperational costs were steep, particularly the payments to AT&T for use of its land lines, and by the end of 1927, Columbia Phonograph wanted out. In early 1928 Judson sold the network to brothers Isaac and Leon Levy, owners of the network's Philadelphia affiliate WCAU, and their partner Jerome Louchheim. None of the three were interested in assuming day-to-day management of the network, so they installed wealthy 26-year-old William S. Paley, son of a Philadelphia cigar family and in-law of the Levys, as president. With the record company out of the picture, Paley quickly streamlined the corporate name to \"Columbia Broadcasting System\". He believed in the power of radio advertising since his family's \"La Palina\" cigars had doubled their sales after young William convinced his elders to advertise on radio. By September 1928, Paley bought out the Louchheim share of CBS and became its majority owner with 51% of the business.\n\nDuring Louchheim's brief regime, Columbia paid $410,000 to Alfred H. Grebe's Atlantic Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) for a small Brooklyn station, WABC (no relation to the current WABC), which would become the network's flagship station. WABC was quickly upgraded, and the signal relocated to 860 kHz. The physical plant was relocated also – to Steinway Hall on West 57th Street in Manhattan, where much of CBS's programming would originate. By the turn of 1929, the network could boast to sponsors of having 47 affiliates.\n\nPaley moved right away to put his network on a firmer financial footing. In the fall of 1928 he entered into talks with Adolph Zukor of Paramount Pictures, who planned to move into radio in response to RCA's forays into motion pictures with the advent of talkies. The deal came to fruition in September 1929: Paramount acquired 49% of CBS in return for a block of its stock worth $3.8 million at the time. The agreement specified that Paramount would buy that same stock back by March 1, 1932, for a flat $5 million, provided CBS had earned $2 million during 1931 and 1932. For a brief time there was talk that the network might be renamed \"Paramount Radio\", but it only lasted a month – the 1929 stock market crash sent all stock value tumbling. It galvanized Paley and his troops, who \"had no alternative but to turn the network around and earn the $2,000,000 in two years... This is the atmosphere in which the CBS of today was born.\" The near-bankrupt movie studio sold its CBS shares back to CBS in 1932. In the first year of Paley's watch, CBS's gross earnings more than tripled, going from $1.4 million to $4.7 million.\nMuch of the increase was a result of Paley's second upgrade to the CBS business plan – improved affiliate relations. There were two types of program at the time: \"sponsored\" and \"sustaining\", i.e., unsponsored. Rival NBC paid affiliates for every sponsored show they carried and charged them for every sustaining show they ran. It was onerous for small and medium stations, and resulted in both unhappy affiliates and limited carriage of sustaining programs. Paley had a different idea, designed to get CBS programs emanating from as many radio sets as possible: he would \"give\" the sustaining programs away for free, provided the station would run every sponsored show, and accept CBS's check for doing so. CBS soon had more affiliates than either NBC Red or NBC Blue.\n\nPaley was a man who valued style and taste, and in 1929, once he had his affiliates happy and his company's creditworthiness on the mend, he relocated his concern to sleek, new 485 Madison Avenue, the \"heart of the advertising community, right where Paley wanted his company to be\" and where it would stay until its move to its own Eero Saarinen-designed headquarters, the CBS Building, in 1965. When his new landlords expressed skepticism about the network and its fly-by-night reputation, Paley overcame their qualms by inking a lease for $1.5 million.\n\nSince NBC was the broadcast arm of radio set manufacturer RCA, its chief David Sarnoff approached his decisions as both a broadcaster and as a hardware executive; NBC's affiliates had the latest RCA equipment, and were often the best-established stations, or were on \"clear channel\" frequencies. Yet Sarnoff's affiliates were mistrustful of him. Paley had no such split loyalties: his – and his affiliates' – success rose and fell with the quality of CBS programming.\n\nPaley had an innate, pitch-perfect, sense of entertainment, \"a gift of the gods, an ear totally pure\", wrote David Halberstam. \"[He] knew what was good and would sell, what was bad and would sell, and what was good and would not sell, and he never confused one with another.\" As the 1930s loomed, Paley set about building the CBS talent stable. The network became the home of many popular musical and comedy stars, among them Jack Benny, (\"Your Canada Dry Humorist\"), Al Jolson, George Burns & Gracie Allen, and Kate Smith, whom Paley personally selected for his family's \"La Palina Hour\" because she was not the type of woman to provoke jealousy in American wives. When, on a mid-ocean voyage, Paley heard a phonograph record of a young unknown crooner, he rushed to the ship's radio room and \"cabled\" New York to sign Bing Crosby immediately to a contract for a daily radio show.\n\nWhile the CBS prime-time lineup featured music, comedy and variety shows, the daytime schedule was a direct conduit into American homes – and into the hearts and minds of American women; for many, it was the bulk of their adult human contact during the course of the day. CBS time salesmen recognized early on that this intimate connection could be a bonanza for advertisers of female-interest products. Starting in 1930, astrologer Evangeline Adams would consult the heavens on behalf of listeners who sent in their birthdays, a description of their problems – and a box-top from sponsor Forhan's toothpaste. The low-key murmuring of smooth-voiced Tony Wons, backed by a tender violin, \"made him a soul mate to millions of women\" on behalf of the R. J. Reynolds tobacco company, whose cellophane-wrapped Camel cigarettes were \"as fresh as the dew that dawn spills on a field of clover\". The most popular radio-friend of all was M. Sayle Taylor, \"The Voice Of Experience\", though his name was never uttered on air. Women mailed descriptions of the most intimate of relationship problems to The Voice in the tens of thousands per week; sponsors Musterole ointment and Haley's M–O laxative enjoyed sales increases of several hundred percent in just the first month of \"The Voice Of Experience\"s run.\nAs the decade progressed, a new genre joined the daytime lineup: serial dramas – soap operas, so named for the products that sponsored them, by way of the ad agencies that actually produced them. Although the form, usually in quarter-hour episodes, proliferated widely in the mid- and late 1930s, they all had the same basic premise: that characters \"fell into two categories: 1) those in trouble and 2) those who helped people in trouble. The helping-hand figures were usually older.\" At CBS, \"Just Plain Bill\" brought human insight and Anacin pain reliever into households; \"Your Family and Mine\" came courtesy of Sealtest Dairy products; \"Bachelor's Children\" first hawked Old Dutch Cleanser, then Wonder Bread; \"Aunt Jenny's Real Life Stories\" was sponsored by Spry Vegetable Shortening. \"Our Gal Sunday\" (Anacin again), \"The Romance of Helen Trent\" (Angélus cosmetics), \"Big Sister\" (Rinso laundry soap) and many others filled the daytime ether.\nThanks to its daytime and primetime schedules, CBS prospered in the 1930s. In 1935 gross sales were $19.3 million, yielding a profit of $2.27 million. By 1937 the network took in $28.7 million and had 114 affiliates, almost all of which cleared 100% of network-fed programming, thus keeping ratings, and revenue, high. In 1938 CBS even acquired the American Record Corporation, parent of its one-time investor Columbia Records.\n\nIn 1938 NBC and CBS each opened studios in Hollywood to attract the entertainment industry's top talent to their networks – NBC at Radio City on Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street, CBS two blocks away at Columbia Square.\n\nThe extraordinary potential of radio news showed itself in 1930, when CBS suddenly found itself with a live telephone connection to a prisoner called \"The Deacon\" who described, from the inside and in real time, a riot and conflagration at the Ohio Penitentiary; for CBS, it was \"a shocking journalistic coup\". Yet as late as 1934, there was still no regularly scheduled newscast on network radio: \"Most sponsors did not want network news programming; those that did were inclined to expect veto rights over it.\" There had been a longstanding wariness between radio and the newspapers as well; the papers had rightly concluded that the upstart radio business would compete with them on two counts – advertising dollars and news coverage. By 1933 they fought back, many no longer publishing radio schedules for readers' convenience, or allowing \"their\" news to be read on the air for radio's profit. Radio, in turn, pushed back when urban department stores, newspapers' largest advertisers and themselves owners of many radio stations, threatened to withhold their ads from print. A short-lived attempted truce in 1933 even saw the papers proposing that radio be forbidden from running news before 9:30 a.m., and then only after 9:00 p.m. – and that no news story could air until it was 12 hours old.\nIt was in this climate that Paley set out to \"enhance the prestige of CBS, to make it seem in the public mind the more advanced, dignified and socially aware network\". He did it through sustaining programming like the New York Philharmonic, the thoughtful drama of Norman Corwin – and an in-house news division to gather and present news, free of fickle suppliers like newspapers and wire services. In the fall of 1934, CBS launched an independent news division, shaped in its first years by Paley's vice-president, former \"New York Times\" columnist Ed Klauber, and news director Paul White. Since there was no blueprint or precedent for real-time news coverage, early efforts of the new division used the shortwave link-up CBS had been using for five years to bring live feeds of European events to its American air.\n\nA key early hire was Edward R. Murrow in 1935; his first corporate title was Director of Talks. He was mentored in microphone technique by Robert Trout, the lone full-time member of the News Division, and quickly found himself in a growing rivalry with boss White. Murrow was glad to \"leave the hothouse atmosphere of the New York office behind\" when he was dispatched to London as CBS's European Director in 1937, a time when the growing Hitler menace underscored the need for a robust European Bureau. Halberstam described Murrow in London as \"the right man in the right place in the right era\". Murrow began assembling the staff of broadcast journalists – including William L. Shirer, Charles Collingwood, Bill Downs, and Eric Sevareid – who would become known as the \"Murrow Boys\". They were \"in [Murrow's] own image, sartorially impeccable, literate, often liberal, and prima donnas all\". They covered history in the making, and sometimes made it themselves: on March 12, 1938, Hitler boldly annexed nearby Austria and Murrow and Boys quickly assembled coverage with Shirer in London, Edgar Ansel Mowrer in Paris, Pierre Huss in Berlin, Frank Gervasi in Rome and Trout in New York. This bore the \"News Round-Up\" format, which is still ubiquitous today in broadcast news.\n\nMurrow's nightly reports from the rooftops during the dark days of the London Blitz galvanized American listeners: even before Pearl Harbor, the conflict became \"the story of the survival of Western civilization, the most heroic of all possible wars and stories. He was indeed reporting on the survival of the English-speaking peoples.\" With his \"manly, tormented voice\", Murrow contained and mastered the panic and danger he felt, thereby communicating it all the more effectively to his audience. Using his trademark self-reference \"This reporter\", he did not so much report news as interpret it, combining simplicity of expression with subtlety of nuance. Murrow himself said he tried \"to describe things in terms that make sense to the truck driver without insulting the intelligence of the professor\". When he returned home for a visit late in 1941, Paley threw an \"extraordinarily elaborate reception\" for Murrow at the Waldorf-Astoria. Of course, its goal was more than just honoring CBS's latest \"star\" – it was an announcement to the world that Mr. Paley's network was finally more than just a pipeline carrying other people's programming: it had now become a cultural force in its own right.\n\nOnce the war was over and Murrow returned for good, it was as \"a superstar with prestige and freedom and respect within his profession and within his company\". He possessed enormous capital within that company, and as the unknown form of television news loomed large, he would spend it freely, first in radio news, then in television, taking on Senator Joseph McCarthy first, then eventually William S. Paley himself, and with a foe that formidable, even the vast Murrow account would soon run dry.\n\nOn October 30, 1938, CBS gained a taste of infamy when \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" broadcast a radio adaptation of H. G. Wells's \"The War of the Worlds\", performed by Orson Welles. Its unique format, a contemporary version of the story in the form of \"faux\" news broadcasts, had panicked many listeners into believing invaders from Mars were actually invading and devastating Grover's Mill, New Jersey, despite \"three\" disclaimers during the broadcast that it was a work of fiction. The flood of publicity after the broadcast had two effects: an FCC ban on \"faux\" news bulletins within dramatic programming, and sponsorship for \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" – the former sustaining program became \"The Campbell Playhouse\" to sell soup. Welles, for his part, summarized the episode as \"the Mercury Theatre's own radio version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying 'Boo!'\"\n\nBefore the United States joined World War II, in 1940, CBS recruited Edmund A. Chester from his position as Bureau Chief for Latin America at the Associated Press to serve as Director of Latin American Relations and Director of Short Wave Broadcasts for the CBS radio network. In this capacity, Chester coordinated the development of the Network of the Americas (La Cadena de las Americas) with the Department of State, the Office for Inter-American Affairs (as chaired by Nelson Rockefeller) and Voice of America as part of President Roosevelt's support for Pan-Americanism during World War II. This network provided vital news and cultural programming throughout South America and Central America during the crucial World War II era and fostered diplomatic relations between the United States and the less developed nations of the continent. It featured such popular radio broadcasts as \"Viva América\" which showcased leading musical talent from both North and South America including John Serry Sr., as accompanied by the CBS Pan American Orchestra under the musical direction of Alfredo Antonini. The post-war era also marked the beginning of CBS's dominance in the field of radio as well.\n\nAs 1939 wound down, Bill Paley announced that 1940 would \"be the greatest year in the history of radio in the United States.\" He turned out to be right by more than anyone could imagine: the decade of the 1940s would indeed be the apogee of network radio by every gauge. Nearly 100% of the advertisers who made sponsorship deals in 1939 renewed their contracts for 1940; manufacturers of farm tractors made radios standard equipment on their machines. Wartime rationing of paper limited the size of newspapers – and effectively advertisements – and when papers turned them away, they migrated to radio sponsorship. A 1942 act by Congress made advertising expenses a tax benefit and that sent even automobile and tire manufacturers – who had no products to sell since they had been converted to war production – scurrying to sponsor symphony orchestras and serious drama on radio. In 1940, only one-third of radio programs were sponsored, while two-thirds were sustaining; by the middle of the decade, the statistics had swapped – two out of three shows now had cash-paying sponsors and only one-third were sustaining.\n\nThe CBS of the 1940s was vastly different from that of the early days; many of the old guard veterans had died, retired or simply left the network. No change was greater than that in Paley himself: he had become difficult to work for, and had \"gradually shifted from leader to despot\". He spent much of his time seeking social connections and in cultural pursuits; his \"hope was that CBS could somehow learn to run itself\". His brief to an interior designer remodeling his townhouse included a requirement for closets that would accommodate 300 suits, 100 shirts and had special racks for a hundred neckties.\nAs Paley grew more remote, he installed a series of buffer executives who sequentially assumed more and more power at CBS: first Ed Klauber, then Paul Kesten, and finally Frank Stanton. Second only to Paley as the author of CBS's style and ambitions in its first half-century, Stanton was \"a magnificent mandarin who functioned as company superintendent, spokesman, and image-maker\". He had come to the network in 1933 after sending copies of his Ph.D. thesis \"A Critique Of Present Methods and a New Plan for Studying Radio Listening Behavior\" to CBS top brass and they responded with a job offer. He scored an early hit with his study \"Memory for Advertising Copy Presented Visually vs. Orally,\" which CBS salesmen used to great effect bringing in new sponsors. In 1946, Paley appointed Stanton as President of CBS and promoted himself to Chairman. Stanton's colorful, but impeccable, wardrobe – slate-blue pinstripe suit, ecru shirt, robin's egg blue necktie with splashes of saffron – made him, in the mind of one sardonic CBS vice-president, \"the greatest argument we have for color television\".\n\nDespite the influx of advertisers and their cash, or perhaps because of them, the 1940s were not without bumps for the radio networks. The biggest challenge came in the form of the FCC's \"chain broadcasting investigation\" – the \"monopoly probe\", as it was often called. Though it started in 1938, the investigation only gathered steam in 1940 under new-broom chairman James L. Fly. By the time the smoke had cleared in 1943, NBC had already spun off its Blue Network, which became the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). CBS was also hit, though not as severely: Paley's brilliant 1928 affiliate contract which had given CBS first claim on local stations' air during sponsored time – the \"network option\" – came under attack as being restrictive to local programming. The final compromise permitted the network option for three out of four hours during certain dayparts, but the new regulations had virtually no practical effect, since most all stations accepted the network feed, especially the sponsored hours that earned them money. Fly's panel also forbade networks from owning artists' representation bureaus, so CBS sold its bureau to Music Corporation of America and it became Management Corporation of America.\nOn the air, the war affected almost every show. Variety shows wove patriotism through their comedy and music segments; dramas and soaps had characters join the service and go off to fight. Even before hostilities commenced in Europe, one of the most played songs on radio was Irving Berlin's \"God Bless America\", popularized by CBS personality Kate Smith. Although an Office of Censorship sprang up within days of Pearl Harbor, censorship would be totally voluntary. A few shows submitted scripts for review; most did not. The guidelines that the Office did issue banned weather reports (including announcement of sports rainouts), news about troop, ship or plane movements, war production and live man-on-the-street interviews. The ban on ad-libbing caused quizzes, game shows and amateur hours to wither for the duration.\n\nSurprising was \"the granite permanence\" of the shows at the top of the ratings. The vaudevillians and musicians who were hugely popular after the war were the same stars who had been huge in the 1930s: Jack Benny, Bing Crosby, Burns and Allen, and Edgar Bergen all had been on the radio almost as long as there had \"been\" network radio. A notable exception to this was relative newcomer Arthur Godfrey who, as late as 1942, was still doing a local morning show in Washington, D.C. Godfrey, who had been a cemetery-lot salesman and a cab driver, pioneered the style of talking directly to the listener as an \"individual\", with a singular \"you\" rather than phrases like \"Now, folks...\" or \"Yes, friends...\". His combined shows contributed as much as 12% of \"all\" CBS revenues; by 1948, he was pulling down $500,000 a year.\n\nIn 1947, Paley, still the undisputed \"head talent scout\" of CBS, led a much-publicized \"talent raid\" on NBC. One day, while Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll were hard at work at NBC writing their venerable \"Amos and Andy\" show, a knock came on the door; it was Paley himself, with an astonishing offer: \"Whatever you are getting now I will give you twice as much.\" Capturing NBC's cornerstone show was enough of a \"coup\", but Paley repeated in 1948 with longtime NBC stars Edgar Bergen, Charlie McCarthy and Red Skelton, as well as former CBS defectors Jack Benny, radio's top-rated comedian, and Burns and Allen. Paley achieved this rout with a legal agreement reminiscent of his 1928 contract that caused some NBC radio affiliates to jump ship and join CBS. CBS would buy the stars' names as a property, in exchange for a large lump sum and a salary. The plan relied on the vastly different tax rates between income and capital gains, so not only would the stars enjoy more than twice their income after taxes, but CBS would preclude any NBC counterattack because CBS owned the performers' names.\n\nAs a result of this, Paley got in 1949 something he had sought for 20 years: CBS finally beat NBC in the ratings. But it was not just to one-up rival Sarnoff that Paley led his talent raid; he, and all of radio, had their eye on the coming force that threw a shadow over radio throughout the 1940s – television.\n\nIn the spring of 1940, CBS staff engineer Peter Goldmark devised a system for color television that CBS management hoped would leapfrog the network over NBC and its existing black-and-white RCA system. The CBS system \"gave brilliant and stable colors\", while NBC's was \"crude and unstable but 'compatible'\". Ultimately, the FCC rejected the CBS system because it was incompatible with RCA's; that, and the fact that CBS had moved to secure many UHF, not VHF, television licenses, left CBS flatfooted in the early television age. In 1946, only 6,000 television sets were in operation, most in greater New York City where there were already three stations; by 1949, the number had increased to 3 million sets, and by 1951, had risen to 12 million. 64 American cities had television stations, though most of them only had one.\n\nRadio continued to be the backbone of the company, at least in the \"early\" 1950s, but it was \"a strange, twilight period\" where some cities had often multiple television stations which siphoned the audience from radio, while other cities (such as Denver and Portland, Oregon) had no television stations at all. In those areas, as well as rural areas and some entire states, network radio remained the sole, nationally broadcast service. NBC's venerable Fred Allen saw his ratings plummet when he was pitted against upstart ABC's game show \"Stop The Music!\"; within weeks, he was dropped by longtime sponsor Ford Motor Company and was shortly gone from the scene. Radio powerhouse Bob Hope's ratings plunged from a 23.8 share in 1949 to 5.4 in 1953. By 1952, \"death seemed imminent for network radio\" in its familiar form; most telling of all, the big sponsors were eager for the switch.\n\nGradually, as the television network took shape, radio stars began to migrate to the new medium. Many programs ran on both media while making the transition. The radio soap opera \"The Guiding Light\" moved to television in 1952 and would run for another 57 years; Burns & Allen, back \"home\" from NBC, made the move in 1950; Lucille Ball a year later; \"Our Miss Brooks\" in 1952 (though it continued simultaneously on radio for its full television life). The high-rated \"Jack Benny Program\" ended its radio run in 1955, and Edgar Bergen's Sunday night show went off the air in 1957. When CBS announced in 1956 that its radio operations had lost money, while the television network had made money, it was clear where the future lay. When the soap opera \"Ma Perkins\" went off the air on November 25, 1960, only eight, relatively minor series remained. Prime time radio ended on September 30, 1962, when \"Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar\" and \"Suspense\" aired for the final time.\n\nThe retirement of Arthur Godfrey in April 1972 marked the end of long-form programming on CBS radio; programming thereafter consisted of hourly news summaries and news features, known in the 1970s as \"Dimension\", and commentaries, including the \"Spectrum\" series that evolved into the \"Point/Counterpoint\" feature on the television network's \"60 Minutes\" and \"First Line Report\", a news and analysis feature delivered by CBS correspondents. The network also continued to offer traditional radio programming through its weeknightly \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\", the lone sustained holdout of dramatic programming, from 1974 to 1982, though shorter runs were given to the \"General Mills Radio Adventure Theater\" and the \"Sears Radio Theater\" in the 1970s; otherwise, most new dramatic radio was carried on public and to some extent religious stations. The CBS Radio Network continues to this day, offering hourly newscasts, including its centerpiece \"CBS World News Roundup\" in the morning and evening, weekend sister program \"CBS News Weekend Roundup\", the news-related feature segment \"The Osgood File\", \"What's In the News\", a one-minute summary of one story, and various other segments such as commentary from Seattle radio personality Dave Ross, tip segments from various other sources, and technology coverage from CBS Interactive property CNET.\nOn November 17, 2017 CBS Radio was sold to Entercom becoming the last of the original Big Four radio network to be owned by its founding company. Although the CBS parent itself ceased to exist when it was acquired by Westinghouse Electric in 1995, CBS Radio continued to be run by CBS until its sale to Entercom. Prior to its acquisition, ABC Radio was sold to Citadel Broadcasting in 2007 (and is now a part of Cumulus Media) while Mutual (now defunct) and NBC Radio were acquired by Westwood One in the 1980s (Westwood One and CBS were under common ownership from 1993 to 2007; the former would be acquired outright by Dial Global in October 2011).\n\nCBS's involvement in television dates back to the opening of experimental station W2XAB in New York City on July 21, 1931, using the mechanical television system that had been more-or-less perfected in the late 1920s. Its initial broadcast featured New York Mayor Jimmy Walker, Kate Smith, and George Gershwin. The station boasted the first regular seven-day broadcasting schedule in American television, broadcasting 28 hours a week.\n\nAnnouncer-director Bill Schudt was the station's only paid employee; all other talent was volunteer. W2XAB pioneered program development including small-scale dramatic acts, monologues, pantomime, and the use of projection slides to simulate sets. Engineer Bill Lodge devised the first synchronized sound wave for a television station in 1932, enabling W2XAB to broadcast picture and sound on a single shortwave channel instead of the two previously needed. On November 8, 1932, W2XAB broadcast the first television coverage of presidential election returns. The station suspended operations on February 20, 1933, as monochrome television transmission standards were in flux, and in the process of changing from a mechanical to an all-electronic system. W2XAB returned to the air with an all-electronic system in 1939 from a new studio complex in Grand Central Station and a transmitter atop the Chrysler Building, broadcasting on channel 2. W2XAB transmitted the first color broadcast in the United States on August 28, 1940.\n\nOn June 24, 1941, W2XAB received a commercial construction permit and program authorization as WCBW. The station went on the air at 2:30 p.m. on July 1, one hour after rival WNBT (channel 1, formerly W2XBS and now WNBC), making it the second authorized fully commercial television station in the United States. The FCC issued permits to CBS and NBC at the same time, and intended WNBT and WCBW to sign on simultaneously on July 1, so no one station could claim to be the \"first\".\n\nDuring the World War II years, commercial television broadcasting was reduced dramatically. Toward the end of the war, commercial television began to ramp up again, with an increased level of programming evident from 1944 to 1947 on the three New York television stations which operated in those years (the local stations of NBC, CBS and DuMont). But as RCA and DuMont raced to establish networks and offer upgraded programming, CBS lagged, advocating an industry-wide shift and restart to UHF for their incompatible (with black and white) color system; the FCC putting an indefinite \"freeze\" on television licenses that lasted until 1952 also did not help matters. Only in 1950, when NBC was dominant in television and black and white transmission was widespread, did CBS begin to buy or build their own stations (outside of New York City) in Los Angeles, Chicago and other major cities. Up to that point, CBS programming was seen on such stations as KTTV in Los Angeles, which CBS – as a bit of insurance and to guarantee program clearance in that market – quickly purchased a 50% interest in that station, partnering with the \"Los Angeles Times\" newspaper. CBS then sold its interest in KTTV (now the West Coast flagship of the Fox network) and purchased outright Los Angeles pioneer station KTSL in 1950, renaming it KNXT (after CBS's existing Los Angeles radio property, KNX), later to become KCBS-TV. In 1953, CBS bought pioneer television station WBKB in Chicago, which had been signed on by former investor Paramount Pictures (and would become a sister company to CBS again decades later) as a commercial station in 1946, and changed that station's call sign to WBBM-TV, moving the CBS affiliation away from WGN-TV.\n\nWCBS-TV would ultimately be the only station () built and signed on by CBS. The rest of the stations would be acquired by CBS, either in an ownership stake or outright purchase. In television's early years, the network bought Washington, D.C. affiliate WOIC (now WUSA) in a joint venture with \"The Washington Post\" in 1950, only to sell its stake to the \"Post\" in 1954 due to then-tighter FCC ownership regulations. CBS would also temporarily return to relying on its own UHF technology by owning WXIX in Milwaukee (now CW affiliate WVTV) and WHCT in Hartford, Connecticut (now Univision affiliate WUVN), but as UHF was not viable for broadcasting at the time (due to the fact that most television sets of the time were not equipped with UHF tuners), CBS decided to sell those stations off and affiliate with VHF stations WITI and WTIC-TV (now WFSB), respectively.\n\nIn Milwaukee alone, CBS has gone through several affiliation changes since 1953, when its original primary affiliate, WCAN-TV (now defunct) first signed on the air; prior to WCAN's sign-on, selected CBS programming aired on WTMJ-TV, a NBC affiliate since 1947. In February 1955, when WCAN went off the air for good, CBS moved its programming to WXIX, in which CBS purchased several months earlier. In April 1959, CBS decided to move its programming to the city's newer VHF station at the time, WITI; in turn, CBS shut down WXIX, and sold its license to local investors, and returned to the air that July as an independent station. The first WITI-CBS union only lasted exactly two years, as the network moved its programming to WISN-TV on April 2, 1961, with WITI taking the ABC affiliation, and the two stations reversed the network swap in March 1977, with WITI returning to the CBS station lineup. CBS was later forced back onto UHF in Milwaukee due to the affiliation agreement with New World Communications that resulted in WITI disaffiliating from the network in December 1994 to join Fox; it is now affiliated with WDJT-TV in that market, which has the longest-lasting relationship with CBS than any other Milwaukee station that carried the network's programming (24 years, as of the end of 2018).\n\nMore long-term, CBS bought stations in Philadelphia (WCAU, now owned by NBC) and St. Louis (KMOX-TV, now KMOV), but CBS would eventually sell these stations off as well; before buying KMOX-TV, CBS had attempted to purchase and sign on the channel 11 license in St. Louis, now KPLR-TV.\n\nCBS did attempt to sign on a station in Pittsburgh after the \"freeze\" was lifted, as that city was then the sixth-largest market but only had one commercial VHF station in DuMont-owned WDTV, while the rest were either on UHF (the modern-day WPGH-TV and WINP-TV) or public television (WQED). Although the FCC turned down CBS's request to buy the channel 9 license in nearby Steubenville, Ohio and move it to Pittsburgh (that station, initially CBS affiliate WSTV-TV, is now NBC affiliate WTOV-TV), CBS did score a major coup when Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse Electric (a co-founder of NBC with RCA) bought WDTV from struggling DuMont and opted to affiliate the now-recalled KDKA-TV with CBS instead of NBC (like KDKA radio) due to NBC extorting and coercing Westinghouse to trade KYW radio and WPTZ (now KYW-TV) for Cleveland stations WTAM, WTAM-FM (now WMJI), and WNBK (now WKYC); the trade ended up being reversed in 1965 by order of the FCC and the United States Department of Justice after an eight-year investigation.\nHad CBS not been able to affiliate with KDKA-TV, it would have affiliated with eventual NBC affiliate WIIC-TV (now WPXI) once it signed on in 1957 instead. This coup would eventually lead to a much stronger relationship between Westinghouse and CBS decades later.\n\nThe \"talent raid\" on NBC of the mid-1940s had brought over established radio stars, who became stars of CBS television programs as well. One reluctant CBS star refused to bring her radio show, \"My Favorite Husband\", to television unless the network would recast the show with her real-life husband in the lead.\n\n\"I Love Lucy\" debuted in October 1951, and was an immediate sensation, with 11 million out of a population of 15 million Television sets watching (73% share). Paley and network president Frank Stanton had so little faith in the future of Lucille Ball's series, that they granted her wish and allowed her husband, Desi Arnaz, to take financial control of the comedy's production. This was the making of the Ball-Arnaz Desilu empire, and became the template for series production to this day; it also served as the template for some television conventions that continue to exist including the use of a multiple cameras to film scenes, the use of a studio audience and the airing of past episodes for syndication to other television outlets. The phenomenal success of a prime-time, big-money quiz show, \"The $64,000 Question\", propelled its creator, Louis G. Cowan, first to an executive position as CBS's vice-president of creative services, then to the presidency of the CBS TV network itself. When the quiz show scandals involving \"rigged\" questions surfaced in 1959, Cowan was fired by CBS.\n\nAs television came to the forefront of American entertainment and information, CBS dominated television as it once had radio. In 1953, the CBS television network would make its first profit, and would maintain dominance on television between 1955 and 1976 as well. By the late 1950s, the network often controlled seven or eight of the slots on the \"top ten\" ratings list with well-respected shows like \"Route 66\".\n\nDuring the Presidency of James T. Aubrey (1958–1965), CBS was able to balance prestigious television projects (befitting the \"Tiffany Network\" image), with more low culture, broad appeal programs. So the network had challenging fare like \"The Twilight Zone\", \"The Defenders\", and \"East Side/West Side\", as well as \"The Andy Griffith Show\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\", and \"Gilligan's Island\".\n\nThis success would continue for many years, with CBS being bumped from first place only due to the rise of ABC in the mid-1970s. Perhaps because of its status as the top-rated network, during the late 1960s and early 1970s CBS felt freer to gamble with controversial properties like the \"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\" and \"All in the Family\" (and its many spinoffs) during this period.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was very successful in television ratings, but many of its shows (including \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Gunsmoke\", \"Mayberry R.F.D.\", \"Petticoat Junction\", \"Hee Haw\" and \"Green Acres\") were appealing more to older and more rural audiences and less to the young, urban and more affluent audiences that advertisers sought to target. Fred Silverman (who would later head ABC, and then later NBC) made the decision to cancel most of those otherwise hit shows by mid-1971 in what became colloquially referred to as the \"Rural Purge\", with \"Green Acres\" cast member Pat Buttram remarking that the network cancelled \"anything with a tree in it\".\n\nWhile the \"rural\" shows got the axe, new hits, like \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"All in the Family\", \"The Bob Newhart Show\", \"Cannon\", \"Barnaby Jones\", \"Kojak\" and \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" took their place on the network's schedule and kept CBS at the top of the ratings through the early 1970s. The majority of these hits were overseen by then East Coast vice president Alan Wagner. \"60 Minutes\" also moved to the 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot on Sundays in 1975 and became the first ever prime time television news program to enter the Nielsen Top 10 in 1978.\n\nOne of CBS's most popular shows during the period was \"M*A*S*H\", a dramedy that ran for 11 seasons from 1972 to 1983 and was based on the hit Robert Altman film; as with the film, the series was set during the Korean War in a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital. The 2-hour series finale, in its initial airing on February 28, 1983, had peak viewership of up to 125 million Americans (77% of all television viewership in the U.S. that night), which established it as the all-time most watched single U.S. television episode; it also held the ubiquitous distinction of having the largest single-night primetime viewership of any television program in U.S. history until it was surpassed by the Super Bowl, which have taken the record consistently since 2010 (through the annual championship game's alternating telecasts by CBS and rival networks Fox and NBC).\n\nSilverman also first developed his strategy of spinning new shows off from established hit series while at CBS, with \"Rhoda\" and \"Phyllis\" spun from \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", \"Maude\" and \"The Jeffersons\" spun from \"All in the Family\" and \"Good Times\" from \"Maude\". After Silverman's departure, CBS dropped behind ABC for second place in the 1976–77 season, but still rated strongly, based on its earlier hits and some new ones: \"One Day at a Time\", \"Alice\", \"Lou Grant\", \"WKRP in Cincinnati\", \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and, the biggest hit of the early 1980s, \"Dallas\", the latter of which holds the record for the all-time most watched non-series finale single U.S. television episode – the November 21, 1980, primetime telecast of the resolution episode of the internationally prominent \"Who Shot J.R.?\" cliffhanger.\n\nBy 1982, ABC had run out of steam, NBC was in dire straits with many failed programming efforts greenlighted by Silverman during his tenure as network president (a three-year run which began in 1978), and CBS once more nosed ahead, courtesy of the major success of \"Dallas\" (and its spin-off \"Knots Landing\"), as well as hits in \"Falcon Crest\", \"Magnum, P.I.\", \"Simon & Simon\" and \"60 Minutes\". CBS also acquired the broadcast rights to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in 1982 (taking over for NBC), which the network has broadcast every March since. CBS bought Emmy-winning documentary producer Dennis B. Kane's production company and formed a new company CBS/Kane Productions International (CKPI). The network managed to pull out a few new hits over the next couple of years – namely \"Kate & Allie\", \"Newhart\", \"Cagney & Lacey\", \"Scarecrow and Mrs. King\", and \"Murder, She Wrote\" – however, this resurgence would be short-lived. CBS had become mired in debt as a result of a failed takeover effort by Ted Turner, which CBS chairman Thomas Wyman successfully helped to fend off. The network sold its St. Louis owned-and-operated station KMOX-TV, and allowed the purchase of a large portion of its shares (under 25 percent) by Loew's Inc. chairman Laurence Tisch. Consequently, collaboration between Paley and Tisch led to the slow dismissal of Wyman, with Tisch taking over as chief operating officer, and Paley returning as chairman.\n\nBy the end of the 1987–88 season, CBS had fallen to third place behind both ABC and NBC for the first time, and had some major rebuilding to do.\n\nIn 1984, \"The Cosby Show\" and \"Miami Vice\" debuted on NBC and immediately garnered high ratings, helping to bring that network back to first place by the 1985–86 season with a slate that included several other hits (such as \"Amen\", \"Family Ties\", \"Cheers\", \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Facts Of Life\", \"L.A. Law\" and \"227\"). ABC had in turn also rebounded with hits such as \"Dynasty\", \"Who's the Boss?\", \"Hotel\", \"Growing Pains\", \"The Wonder Years\", and \"Roseanne\".\n\nSome of the groundwork had been laid as CBS fell in the ratings, with hits \"Simon & Simon\", \"Falcon Crest\", \"Murder, She Wrote\", \"Kate & Allie\" and \"Newhart\" still on the schedule from the most recent resurgence, and future hits \"Designing Women\", \"Murphy Brown\", \"Jake and the Fatman\" and newsmagazine \"48 Hours\" having debuted during the late 1980s. The network was also still getting decent ratings for \"60 Minutes\", \"Dallas\" and \"Knots Landing\"; however, the ratings for \"Dallas\" were a far cry from what they were in the early 1980s. During the early 1990s, the network would bolster its sports lineup by obtaining the broadcast television rights to Major League Baseball from ABC and NBC and the Winter Olympics from ABC despite losing the National Basketball Association to NBC after the 1989–90 NBA season.\n\nUnder network president Jeff Sagansky, the network was able to earn strong ratings from new shows \"\"; \"Touched by an Angel\"; \"Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman\"; \"Walker, Texas Ranger, Picket Fences\" and a resurgent \"Jake and the Fatman\" during this period, and CBS was able to reclaim the first place crown briefly, in the 1992–93 season; however, a drawback for the network during this time-frame was that its programming slate skewed towards an older demographic than ABC, NBC or even Fox, with its relatively limited presence at that time; a joke even floated around that CBS was \"the network for the living dead\" during this period. In 1993, the network made a breakthrough in establishing a successful late-night talk show franchise to compete with NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" when it signed David Letterman away from NBC after the \"Late Night\" host was passed over as Johnny Carson's successor on \"Tonight\" in favor of Jay Leno.\n\nDespite having success with \"Late Show with David Letterman\", 1993 saw the network suffer to a time where television changed forever. The network lost the rights to two major sports leagues: the network terminated its contract with Major League Baseball (after losing approximately US$500 million over a four-year span), with the league reaching a new contract with NBC and ABC. Then on December 17 of that year, in a move that surprised many media analysts and television viewers, Fox – then a fledgling network that in its then-seven years on the air had begun to accrue several popular programs in the Nielsen Top 20 alongside its established counterparts – outbid CBS for the broadcast rights to the National Football Conference, stripping the elder network of National Football League game telecasts for the first time since CBS began broadcasting games from the pre-merger NFL in 1955; Fox bid $1.58 billion for the NFC television rights, significantly higher than CBS's reported offer of $290 million to retain the contract.\n\nThe acquisition of the NFC rights, which took effect with the 1994 NFL season, and which led to CBS being nicknamed \"Can't Broadcast Sports\", resulted in Fox striking a series of affiliation deals with longtime affiliates of each of the Big Three networks; CBS bore the brunt of the switches, with many of its existing affiliates being lured away by Fox (especially those owned by New World Communications, which Fox struck its largest affiliation deal with) while most of the stations that CBS ended up affiliating with to replace the previous affiliates it lost to Fox were former Fox affiliates and independent stations, most of which had limited to no local news presence prior to joining CBS. The network attempted to fill the loss of NFL by going after the rights to the National Hockey League; however, when CBS countered with a bid, Fox also outbid the network for the NHL rights.\n\nThe loss of the NFL, along with an ill-fated effort to court younger viewers, led to a drop in CBS's ratings. One of the shows that was affected was the \"Late Show with David Letterman\", which saw its viewership decline in large part due to the affiliation switches, at times even landing in third place in its timeslot behind ABC's \"Nightline\"; as a result, NBC's \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", which the \"Late Show\" often dominated over during the first two years of that show's run, became the top-rated late-night talk show. Still, CBS was able to produce some hits during the mid-1990s, such as \"The Nanny\", \"JAG\" (which moved to the network from NBC), \"Chicago Hope\", \"Cosby\", \"Cybill\", \"Touched by an Angel\" and \"Everybody Loves Raymond\".\n\nCBS attempted to court families on Fridays with the launch of a family-oriented comedy block, the \"CBS Block Party\", in the 1997–98 season (consisting of \"Family Matters\", \"Step by Step\", \"Meego\" and \"The Gregory Hines Show\", all but the latter coming from Miller-Boyett Productions, which had maintained a relationship with ABC during the late 1980s and 1990s). The lineup failed to compete against ABC's \"TGIF\" lineup (which saw its own viewership erode that season): \"Meego\" and \"Hines\" were cancelled by November, while \"Family Matters\" and \"Step by Step\" were put on hiatus and ended their runs in the summer of 1998. That winter, CBS aired its last Olympic Games to date with its telecast of the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano; NBC, which had already held the rights to the Summer Olympics since 1988, took over coverage of the Winter Olympics beginning with the 2002 Games.\n\nThe building blocks for the network's return to the top of the ratings were put in place in 1997, when CBS regained the NFL through its acquisition of the broadcast television rights to the American Football Conference (stripping that package from NBC after 32 years), effective with the 1998 season. The contract was struck shortly before the AFC's emergence as the dominant NFL conference over the NFC, spurred in part by the turnaround of the New England Patriots in the 2000s. With the help of the AFC package, CBS surpassed NBC for first place in the 1998–1999 season; however, it was beaten by ABC the following year. The network gained additional hits in the late 1990s and early 2000s with series such as \"The King of Queens\", \"Nash Bridges\", \"Judging Amy\", \"Becker\" and \"Yes, Dear\".\n\nAnother turning point for CBS came in the summer of 2000 when it debuted the summer reality shows \"Survivor\" and \"Big Brother\", which became surprise summer hits for the network. In January 2001, CBS debuted the of \"Survivor\" after its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXV and scheduled it on Thursdays at 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time; it also moved the investigative crime drama \"\" (which had debuted that fall in the Friday 9:00 p.m. time slot) to follow \"Survivor\" at 9:00 p.m. on Thursdays. The pairing of the two shows was both able to chip away at and eventually beat NBC's Thursday night lineup, and attract younger viewers to the network.\n\nDuring the 2000s, CBS found additional successes with a slew of police procedurals (several of which were produced by Jerry Bruckheimer) including \"Cold Case\", \"Without a Trace\", \"Criminal Minds\", \"NCIS\" and \"The Mentalist\", along with \"CSI\" spinoffs \"\" and \"\". The network also featured several prominent sitcoms like \"Still Standing\", \"Two and a Half Men\", \"How I Met Your Mother\", \"The New Adventures of Old Christine\", \"Rules of Engagement\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\", as well as the reality show \"The Amazing Race\". The network's programming slate, buoyed largely by the success of \"CSI\", briefly led the network to retake first place in the ratings from NBC in the 2002–03 season. The decade also saw CBS finally make ratings headway on Friday nights, a perennial weak spot for the network, with a focus toward drama series such as \"Ghost Whisperer\" and the relatively short-lived but critically acclaimed \"Joan of Arcadia\".\n\nCBS became the most watched American broadcast television network once again in the 2005–06 season, an achievement that the network proclaimed in on-air promotions as being \"America's Most Watched Network\" (a term it would use again in the 2011–12 season). This lasted until the 2007–08 season, when Fox overtook CBS for first, becoming the first non-Big Three network to earn the title as the most watched network overall in the United States; despite CBS's continued strong lineup, Fox's first-place finish that season was primarily due to its reliance on \"American Idol\" (the longest reigning #1 prime time U.S. television program from 2004 to 2011) and the effects of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. CBS retook its place as the top-rated network in the 2008–09 season, where it has remained every season since. Fox and CBS, both having ranked as the highest rated of the major broadcast networks during the 2000s, tend to nearly equal one another in the 18–34, 18–49 and 25–54 demographics, with either network alternating in placing first in either of these groups by very close margins. \"NCIS\", which has been the flagship of CBS's Tuesday lineup for much of its run, became the network's highest-rated drama by the 2007–08 season.\n\nThe 2010s saw additional hits for the network including drama series \"The Good Wife\"; police procedurals \"Person of Interest\", \"Blue Bloods\", \"Elementary\", \"Hawaii Five-0\" and \"NCIS\" spin-off \"\"; reality series \"Undercover Boss\"; and sitcoms \"2 Broke Girls\" and \"Mike & Molly\". \"The Big Bang Theory\", one of several sitcoms from veteran writer/producer Chuck Lorre, started off with modest ratings but saw its viewership skyrocket (earning per episode ratings of up to 17 million viewers) to become the top-rated network sitcom in the U.S. by the 2010–11 season, as well as the second most watched U.S. television program starting from the 2013–14 season, when the series became the anchor of the network's Thursday lineup. Meanwhile, the Lorre-produced series it overtook for the position, \"Two and a Half Men\", saw its ratings decline to respectable levels for its final four seasons following the 2011 firing of original star Charlie Sheen (due to a dispute with Lorre) and the addition of Ashton Kutcher as its primary lead.\n\nUntil 2012, CBS ranked in second place among adults 18-49, but after the ratings declines Fox experienced during the 2012–13 fall season, the network was able to take the top spot in the demographic as well as in total viewership (for the fifth year in a row) by the start of 2013. At the end of the 2012–13 season, the tenth season of \"NCIS\" took the top spot among the season's most watched network programs, which gave CBS its top-rated show after \"American Idol\" ended its eight-year nationwide primetime lead (with \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" taking over the top spot from \"Idol\" the year before and from \"NCIS\" the year after), for the first time since the 2002–03 season (when \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" led Nielsen's seasonal prime time network ratings).\n\nThe strength of its 2013–14 slate led to a surplus of series on CBS's 2014–15 schedule, with 21 series held over from the previous season, along with eight new series including moderate hits in \"Madam Secretary\", \"\" and \"Scorpion\". Also, midseason hits \"The Odd Couple\" reboot and \"CSI\" spinoff \"\". The network also expanded its NFL coverage through a partnership with NFL Network to carry \"Thursday Night Football\" games during the first eight weeks of the NFL season.\n\nOn September 29, 2016, National Amusements, the owner of both CBS' parent company, CBS Corporation, and its sister company Viacom (owner of Paramount Pictures), sent a letter to both companies, encouraging them to merge back into one company. On December 12, the deal was called off. However, on January 12, 2018, CNBC reported that both CBS and Viacom have since re-entered talks to merge. On August 13, 2019, CEO Shari Redstone announced that Viacom and CBS have agreed to a merger, reuniting the two media giants after 14 years.\n\nThe two companies have also been reported as in talks to acquire Lionsgate, along with Amazon, Verizon, and Comcast (owner of both NBC and CNBC via its NBCUniversal division) in order to bulk up after the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox and its assets from Rupert Murdoch by The Walt Disney Company. This was reported at the same time as the CBS and Viacom re-merger talks. Lionsgate Vice Chairman Michael Burns has stated in an interview with CNBC that Lionsgate is mostly interested in merging with CBS and Viacom.\n\nUpon becoming commercial station WCBW in 1941, the pioneer CBS television station in New York City broadcast two daily news programs, at 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. weekdays, anchored by Richard Hubbell. Most of the newscasts featured Hubbell reading a script with only occasional cutaways to a map or still photograph. When Pearl Harbor was bombed on December 7, 1941, WCBW (which was usually off-the-air on Sundays to give the engineers a day off), took to the air at 8:45 p.m. that evening with an extensive special report. The national emergency even broke down the unspoken wall between CBS radio and television. WCBW executives convinced radio announcers and experts such as George Fielding Elliot and Linton Wells to come down to the station's Grand Central Station studios during the evening, and give information and commentary on the attack. Although WCBW's special report that night lasted less than 90 minutes, that special broadcast pushed the limits of live television in 1941 and opened up new possibilities for future broadcasts. As CBS wrote in a special report to the FCC, the unscheduled live news broadcast on December 7 \"was unquestionably the most stimulating challenge and marked the greatest advance of any single problem faced up to that time\". Additional newscasts were scheduled in the early days of the war.\n\nIn May 1942, WCBW (like almost all television stations) sharply cut back its live program schedule and cancelled its newscasts, as the station temporarily suspended studio operations, resorting exclusively to the occasional broadcast of films. This was primarily due to the fact that much of the staff had either joined the service or were redeployed to war-related technical research, and to prolong the life of the early, unstable cameras which were now impossible to repair due to the lack of parts available during wartime. In May 1944, as the war began to turn in favor of the Allies, WCBW reopened its studios and resumed production of its newscasts, which were briefly anchored by Ned Calmer, and then by Everett Holles. After the war, WCBW (which changed its call letters to WCBS-TV in 1946) introduced expanded news programs on its schedule – first anchored by Milo Boulton, and later by Douglas Edwards. On May 3, 1948, Edwards began anchoring \"CBS Television News\", a regular 15-minute nightly newscast on the rudimentary CBS television network, including WCBS-TV. Airing every weeknight at 7:30 p.m., it was the first regularly scheduled, network television news program featuring an anchor (the nightly Lowell Thomas NBC radio network newscast was simulcast on television locally on NBC's WNBT (now WNBC) for a time in the early 1940s and Hubbell, Calmer, Holles and Boulton on WCBW in the early and mid-1940s, but these were local television broadcasts seen only in the New York City market).\n\nThe NBC television network's offering at the time \"NBC Television Newsreel\" (premiering in February 1948) was simply film footage with voice narration to provide illustration of the stories.\n\nIn 1949, CBS offered the first live television coverage of the proceedings of the United Nations General Assembly. This journalistic tour-de-force was under the direction of Edmund A. Chester, who was appointed to the post of Director for News, Special Events and Sports at CBS Television in 1948.\n\nIn 1950, the nightly newscast was retitled \"Douglas Edwards with the News\", and the following year, it became the first news program to be broadcast on both coasts, thanks to a new coaxial cable connection, prompting Edwards to use the greeting, \"Good evening everyone, coast to coast\" to begin each edition. The broadcast was renamed the \"CBS Evening News\" when Walter Cronkite replaced Edwards in 1962. Edwards remained with CBS News as anchor/reporter for various daytime television and radio news broadcasts until his retirement on April 1, 1988.\n\nAlthough CBS Television was the first with a working color television system, the network lost out to RCA in 1953, due in part because the CBS color system was incompatible with existing black-and-white sets. Although RCA – then-parent company of NBC – made its color system available to CBS, the network was not interested in boosting RCA's profits and televised only a few specials in color for the rest of the decade.\n\nThe specials included the \"Ford Star Jubilee\" programs (which included the first telecast ever of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)'s 1939 film classic \"The Wizard of Oz\") as well as the 1957 telecast of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella\"; Cole Porter's musical version of \"Aladdin\"; and \"Playhouse 90\"s only color broadcast, the 1958 production of \"The Nutcracker\", featuring choreography by George Balanchine. The \"Nutcracker\" telecast was based on the famous production staged annually since 1954 in New York, and performed by the New York City Ballet. CBS would later show two other versions of the ballet, a semi-forgotten one-hour German-American version hosted by Eddie Albert, shown annually for three years beginning in 1965, and the well-loved Mikhail Baryshnikov production from 1977 to 1981 (this production later moved to PBS).\n\nBeginning in 1959, \"The Wizard of Oz\", now telecast by CBS as a family special in its own right (after the cancellation of \"Ford Star Jubilee\"), became an annual tradition on color television. However, it was the success of NBC's 1955 telecast of the musical \"Peter Pan\", starring Mary Martin, the most watched television special of its time, that inspired CBS to telecast \"The Wizard of Oz\", \"Cinderella\" and \"Aladdin\".\n\nFrom 1960 to 1965, the CBS television network limited its color broadcasts to only a few special presentations such as \"The Wizard of Oz\", and only then if the sponsor would pay for it. Red Skelton was the first CBS host to telecast his weekly programs in color, using a converted movie studio, in the early 1960s; he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the network to use his facility for other programs, and was then forced to sell it. Color was being pushed hard by rival NBC; even ABC had several color programs, beginning in the fall of 1962; however, those were limited because of financial and technical issues that the network was going through at the time. One particularly notable television special aired by CBS during this era was the Charles Collingwood-hosted tour of the White House with First Lady Jackie Kennedy, which was broadcast in black-and-white.\n\nBeginning in 1963, at least one CBS show, \"The Lucy Show\", began filming in color at the insistence of its star and producer Lucille Ball; she realized that color episodes would command more money when they were eventually sold into syndication, but even it was broadcast in black and white through the end of the 1964–65 season. This would all change by the mid-1960s, when market pressure forced CBS Television to begin adding color programs to its regular schedule for the 1965–66 season and complete the transition to the format during the 1966–67 season. By the fall of 1967, nearly all of CBS's television programs were in color, as was the case with those aired by NBC and ABC. A notable exception was \"The Twentieth Century\", which consisted mostly of newsreel archival footage, though even this program used at least some color footage by the late 1960s. CBS acquired the new color broadcasting equipment from Philips which bore the Norelco brand name at that time.\n\nIn 1965, CBS telecast a new color version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's \"Cinderella\". This version, starring Lesley Ann Warren and Stuart Damon in the roles formerly played by Julie Andrews and Jon Cypher, was shot on videotape rather than being telecast live, and would become an annual tradition on the network for the next nine years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC outbid CBS for the rights to the annual telecast of \"The Wizard of Oz\", with the film moving to NBC beginning the following year. However, the network quickly realized their mistake in allowing what was then one of its prime ratings winners to be acquired by another network, and by 1976, CBS reacquired the television rights to the film, with the network continuing to broadcast it through the end of 1997. CBS aired \"The Wizard of Oz\" twice in 1991, in March and again the night before Thanksgiving. Thereafter, it was broadcast on the night before Thanksgiving.\n\nBy the end of the 1960s, CBS was broadcasting virtually its entire programming lineup in color.\n\nPrior to the 1960s, CBS's acquisitions had been related mainly to its broadcasting business; these had included the purchases of American Record Corporation and Hytron. During the 1950s and early 1960s, CBS operated a CBS-Columbia division, manufacturing phonographs, radios and television sets; however, the company had problems with product quality, which partly hindered any possibility of success in that field. In 1955, CBS purchased animation studio Terrytoons Inc. from its founder Paul Terry, not only acquiring Terry's 25-year backlog of cartoons for the network but continuing the studio's ongoing contract to provide theatrical cartoons for 20th Century Fox well into the 1960s.\n\nDuring the 1960s, CBS began an effort to diversify its portfolio, and looked for suitable investments. In 1965, it acquired electric guitar maker Fender from Leo Fender, who agreed to sell his company due to health problems. The purchase also included that of Rhodes electric pianos, which had already been acquired by Fender. This and other acquisitions led to a restructuring of the corporation into various operating groups and divisions; the quality of the products manufactured by these acquired companies fell dramatically, resulting in the terms \"pre-CBS\" to refer to products of higher, sought after quality and \"CBS\" for products of mass-produced lower quality.\n\nIn other diversification attempts, CBS would buy (and later sell) a varied number of other properties including sports teams (especially the New York Yankees baseball club), book and magazine publishers (Fawcett Publications including \"Woman's Day\", and Holt, Rinehart and Winston), map-makers and toy manufacturers (Gabriel Toys, Child Guidance, Wonder Products, Gym Dandy and Ideal), X-Acto knives, and distributors of educational films and film strips, Bailey Films Inc. and Film Associates of California, which it merged into one company, BFA Educational Media. CBS also developed an early home video system called EVR (Electronic Video Recording), but was never able to launch it successfully.\n\nAs William Paley aged, he tried to find the one person who could follow in his footsteps. However, numerous successors-in-waiting came and went. By the mid-1980s, investor Laurence Tisch had begun to acquire substantial holdings in CBS. Eventually he gained Paley's confidence, and with his support, took control of CBS in 1986. Tisch's primary interest was turning profits. When CBS faltered, underperforming units were given the axe. Among the first properties to be jettisoned was the Columbia Records group, which had been part of the company since 1938. In 1986, Tisch also shut down the CBS Technology Center in Stamford, Connecticut, which had started in New York City in the 1930s as CBS Laboratories and evolved to be the company's technology research and development unit.\n\nThrough its CBS Productions unit, the company produced a few shows for non-CBS networks, like NBC's \"Caroline in the City\".\n\nColumbia Records was acquired by CBS in 1938. In 1962, CBS launched CBS Records International to market Columbia recordings outside of North America, where the Columbia name was controlled by other entities. In 1966, CBS Records was made a separate subsidiary of Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. CBS sold the CBS Records Group to Sony on November 17, 1987, initiating the Japanese buying spree of U.S. companies (such as MCA, Pebble Beach Co., Rockefeller Center and the Empire State Building) that continued into the 1990s. The record label company was rechristened Sony Music Entertainment in 1991, as Sony had a short term license on the CBS name.\n\nSony purchased from EMI its rights to the Columbia Records name outside the U.S., Canada, Spain and Japan. Sony now uses Columbia Records as a label name in all countries except Japan, where Sony Records remains their flagship label. Sony acquired the Spanish rights when Sony Music merged with Bertelsmann subsidiary BMG in 2004 as Sony BMG, co-owned by Sony and Bertelsmann; Sony bought out BMG's share in 2008. CBS Corporation formed a new record label named CBS Records in 2006.\n\nCBS entered the publishing business in 1967 by acquiring Holt, Rinehart & Winston, a publisher of trade books and textbooks as well as the magazine \"Field & Stream\". The following year, CBS acquired the medical publishing company Saunders and merged it into Holt, Rinehart & Winston. In 1971, CBS acquired Bond/Parkhurst, the publisher of \"Road & Track\" and \"Cycle World\". CBS greatly expanded its magazine business by purchasing Fawcett Publications in 1974, bringing in such magazines as \"Woman's Day\". In 1982, CBS acquired the British publisher Cassell from Macmillan Inc.. In 1984, it acquired the majority of the publications owned by Ziff Davis.\n\nCBS sold its book publishing businesses in 1985. The educational publishing division, which retained the Holt, Rinehart & Winston name, was sold to Harcourt Brace Jovanovich; the US trade book division, renamed Henry Holt and Company, was sold to the West German publisher Holtzbrinck. Cassell was sold in a management buyout. CBS exited the magazine business through the sale of the unit to its executive Peter Diamandis, who later sold the magazines to Hachette Filipacchi Médias in 1988, forming Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S.\n\nForming the CBS Musical Instruments division, the company also acquired Fender (1965–1983), Electro-Music Inc. (Leslie speakers) (1965–1980), Rogers Drums (1966–1983), Steinway pianos (1972–1985), Gemeinhardt flutes, Lyon & Healy harps (in the late 1970s), Rodgers (institutional) organs, and Gulbransen home organs. The company's last musical instrument manufacturer purchase was its 1981 acquisition of the assets of then-bankrupt ARP Instruments, a developer of electronic synthesizers.\n\nIt is widely held that, between 1965 and 1985, the quality of Fender guitars and amplifiers declined significantly. Encouraged by outraged Fender fans, CBS Musical Instruments division executives executed a leveraged buyout in 1985 and created Fender Musical Instruments Corporation. At the same time, CBS divested itself of Rodgers, along with Steinway and Gemeinhardt, all of which were purchased by holding company Steinway Musical Properties. The other musical instrument manufacturing properties were also liquidated.\n\nCBS made a brief, unsuccessful move into film production in the late 1960s, through the creation of Cinema Center Films. This profit-free unit was shut down in 1972; the distribution rights to the Cinema Center library today rest with Paramount Pictures for home video (via CBS Home Entertainment) and theatrical release, and with CBS Television Distribution for television syndication (most other ancillary rights remain with CBS). The studio released such films as the 1969 Steve McQueen drama \"The Reivers\" and the 1970 Albert Finney musical \"Scrooge\".\n\nTen years after Cinema Center ceased operations, in 1982, CBS made another attempt at a venture in the film industry, in a joint venture with Columbia Pictures and HBO called TriStar Pictures. Despite releasing such box office successes as \"The Natural\", \"Places in the Heart\" and \"\", CBS felt the studio was not making a profit and in 1985, sold its stake in TriStar to Columbia Pictures' then-corporate parent The Coca-Cola Company.\n\nIn 2007, CBS Corporation announced its intent to get back into the feature film business, slowly launching CBS Films and hiring key executives in the spring of 2008 to start up the new venture. The CBS Films name was actually used previously in 1953, when it was briefly used for CBS's distributor of off-network and first-run syndicated programming to local television stations in the United States and internationally.\n\nCBS entered into the home video market, when it partnered with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to form MGM/CBS Home Video in 1978; the joint venture was dissolved by 1982, after MGM purchased United Artists. CBS later partnered with another studio, 20th Century Fox, to form CBS/Fox Video. CBS's duty was to release some of the film titles released by TriStar Pictures under the CBS/Fox Video label.\n\nCBS entered the video game market briefly, through its acquisition of Gabriel Toys (renamed CBS Toys), publishing several arcade adaptations and original titles under the name \"CBS Electronics\", for the Atari 2600, and other consoles and computers; it also produced one of the first karaoke recording/players. CBS Electronics also distributed all Coleco-related video game products in Canada, including the ColecoVision. CBS later sold Gabriel Toys to View-Master, which eventually ended up as part of Mattel.\n\nBy the early 1990s, profits had fallen as a result of competition from cable television and video rentals, and in consequence of the high cost of programming. About 20 former CBS affiliates switched to the rapidly rising Fox network in the mid-1990s, while many television markets across the United States (KDFX in Palm Springs, California, and KECY in Yuma, Arizona, were reportedly the first to switch in August 1994) lost their CBS affiliate for a while. The network's ratings were acceptable, but it struggled with an image of stodginess. Laurence Tisch lost interest and sought a new buyer.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, CBS formed an affiliate relationship with Westinghouse Electric Corporation as a partial result of losing many longtime affiliates owned by New World Communications through an affiliation agreement with Fox that New World signed in May 1994. The New World deal resulted in CBS affiliating with UHF stations in Detroit and Cleveland – former Fox affiliate WOIO and low-rated ethnic independent WGPR-TV (now WWJ-TV), the latter of which was purchased by the network – after a failed attempt to woo the respective longtime ABC affiliates in those markets, WXYZ-TV and WEWS-TV (the latter of which had previously been a CBS affiliate from 1947 to 1955) to respectively replace departing affiliates WJBK and WJW-TV, a situation that the E. W. Scripps Company actually used as leverage to sign a group-wide affiliation deal with ABC that kept the network on WXYZ and WEWS.\n\nIncluded in the Scripps deal was Baltimore NBC affiliate WMAR-TV (which had been affiliated with CBS from 1948 to 1981), displacing longtime ABC affiliate WJZ-TV, despite the fact that Westinghouse-owned WJZ-TV had long been the Baltimore market's dominant station while WMAR-TV had long been in a distant third and even nearly lost its license in 1991. This did not sit well with Westinghouse, who even before the New World deal was already seeking a group-wide affiliation deal of its own, but accelerated the process after the Scripps-ABC agreement.\n\nIn 1994, Westinghouse signed a long-term deal to affiliate all five of its television stations with CBS. Of the other four stations, two of the stations (KPIX in San Francisco and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh) were already longtime affiliates of the network, while two others (KYW-TV in Philadelphia and WBZ-TV in Boston) were longtime affiliates of NBC. The network decided to sell off existing O&O in Philadelphia, WCAU, which would eventually be purchased by NBC, despite at the time being much higher rated locally than KYW-TV. While WJZ-TV and WBZ-TV switched to CBS in January 1995, the swap was delayed in Philadelphia when CBS discovered that an outright sale of channel 10 would have forced it to pay massive taxes on the proceeds from the deal. To solve this problem, CBS, NBC and Group W entered into a complex ownership/affiliation deal in the summer of 1995. NBC traded KCNC-TV in Denver and KUTV in Salt Lake City to CBS in return for WCAU, which for legal reasons would be an even trade. CBS then traded controlling interest in KCNC and KUTV to Group W in return for a minority stake in KYW-TV. As compensation for the loss of stations, NBC and CBS traded transmitter facilities in Miami, with NBC-owned WTVJ moving to channel 6 and CBS-owned WCIX moving to channel 4 as WFOR-TV.\n\nOn August 1, 1995, Westinghouse Electric Company acquired CBS outright for $5.4 billion. As one of the major broadcasting group owners of commercial radio and television stations (as Group W) since 1920, Westinghouse sought to transition from a station operator into a major media company with its purchase of CBS. Except for KUTV (which CBS sold to Four Points Media Group in 2007, and is now owned by the Sinclair Broadcast Group), all of the stations involved in the initial Westinghouse deal as well as WWJ-TV remain owned-and-operated stations of the network to this day.\n\nWestinghouse's acquisition of CBS had the effect of suddenly turning the combined company's all-news radio stations in New York City (WCBS and WINS) and Los Angeles (KNX and KFWB) from bitter rivals to sister stations. While KFWB switched from all-news to news/talk in 2009, WINS and WCBS remain all-news stations, with WINS (which pioneered the all-news format in 1965) concentrating its news coverage on the five core New York City boroughs and WCBS, with its much more powerful signal, covering the surrounding tri-state metropolitan area. In Chicago, the situation started out with Westinghouse's WMAQ beginning to feature long-form stories and discussions about the news, along with a business news focus to differentiate from WBBM until 2000, when an FCC ownership situation had CBS Radio deciding to move its all sports WSCR to WMAQ's signal to sell off the former WSCR facility.\n\nIn 1997, Westinghouse acquired the Infinity Broadcasting Corporation, owner of more than 150 radio stations, for $4.9 billion. Also that year, Westinghouse created CBS Cable, a division formed through the acquisition of two existing cable channels from the Gaylord Entertainment Company (The Nashville Network (now Spike) and Country Music Television) and starting a new one (CBS Eye on People, which was later sold to Discovery Communications). CBS also owned the Spanish-language news network CBS Telenoticias.\n\nFollowing the Infinity purchase, operation and sales responsibilities for the CBS Radio Network was handed to Infinity, which turned management over to Westwood One, a major radio program syndicator that Infinity managed which had previously purchased the Mutual Broadcasting System, NBC's radio networks and the rights to use the \"NBC Radio Networks\" name. For a time, CBS Radio, NBC Radio Networks and CNN's radio news services were all under the Westwood One umbrella. , Westwood One continues to distribute CBS radio programming, but as a self-managed company that put itself up for sale and found a buyer for a significant amount of its stock.\n\nAlso in 1997, Westinghouse changed its name to CBS Corporation, and corporate headquarters were moved from Pittsburgh to New York City. To underline the change in emphasis, all non-entertainment assets were put up for sale. Another 90 radio stations were added to Infinity's portfolio in 1998 with the acquisition of American Radio Systems Corporation for $2.6 billion.\n\nIn 1999, CBS paid $2.5 billion to acquire King World Productions, a television syndication company whose programs included \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\". By the end of 1999, all pre-CBS elements of Westinghouse's industrial past (beyond retaining rights to the name for brand licensing purposes) were gone.\n\nBy the 1990s, CBS had become a broadcasting giant; however, in 1999, entertainment conglomerate Viacom – a company that was created by CBS in 1952 as CBS Films, Inc. to syndicate old CBS series and was spun off under the Viacom name in 1971 – announced it was taking over its former parent in a deal valued at $37 billion. Following completion of this effort on May 4, 2000, Viacom became the second-largest entertainment company in the world. Coincidentally, Viacom had purchased Paramount Pictures, which had once invested in CBS, in 1994.\n\nHaving assembled all the elements of a communications empire, Viacom found that the promised synergy was not there; in 2005, Viacom announced that it would split the company into two separately operated but commonly controlled entities. CBS became the center of a new company, CBS Corporation. The legal successor to the old Viacom, the company's properties included the broadcasting entities (CBS and UPN, the latter of which later merged with Time Warner-owned the WB to form the CW; the Viacom Television Stations Group, which became CBS Television Stations; and CBS Radio); Paramount Television's production operations (now known as CBS Television Studios); Viacom Outdoor advertising (renamed CBS Outdoor); Showtime Networks; Simon & Schuster; and Paramount Parks, which the company sold in May 2006. The other company, which retained the Viacom name, kept Paramount Pictures, assorted MTV Networks, BET Networks, and Famous Music (the latter of which was sold to Sony/ATV Music Publishing in May 2007).\n\nAs a result of the Viacom/CBS corporate split, as well as other acquisitions over recent years, CBS (under the moniker CBS Studios) owns a massive film and television library spanning nine decades; these include acquired material from Viacom and CBS in-house productions and network programs, as well as programs (many originally produced by Paramount and others) originally aired on competing networks (such as ABC and NBC). Shows and other material in this library include among others, \"I Love Lucy\", \"The Honeymooners\", \"The Twilight Zone\", \"Hawaii Five-O\" (both the original and current remake), \"Gunsmoke\", \"The Fugitive\", \"The Love Boat\", \"Little House on the Prairie\" (U.S. television rights only), \"Cheers\", \"Becker\", \"Family Ties\", \"Happy Days\" and its spin-offs, \"The Brady Bunch\", \"Star Trek\", \"The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles\" (distribution rights on behalf of copyright holder Lucasfilm), \"Evening Shade\", \"Duckman\", \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation\" and its spin-offs, the CBS theatrical library (including \"My Fair Lady\" and \"Scrooge\"), and the entire Terrytoons library from 1930 forward.\n\nViacomCBS are owned by National Amusements, the Sumner Redstone-owned company that controlled the original Viacom prior to the split. As such, Paramount Home Media Distribution (formerly Paramount Home Entertainment) continues to handle DVD and Blu-ray distribution for the CBS library.\n\nIn August 2019, Viacom and CBS reunited to invest in more movies and TV shows and become a bigger player in the growing business of streaming video. With the completion of the deal, occurred on December 4, 2019, ViacomCBS have a combined library with over 140,000 TV episodes and 3,600 film titles, including the \"Star Trek\" and \"\" franchises.\n\n, CBS provides 87 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturday from 8:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific (7:00–10:00 p.m. Central/Mountain) and Sunday from 7:00–11:00 p.m. (6:00–10:00 p.m. Central/Mountain).\n\nDaytime programming is also provided between 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. weekdays (including a half-hour break for local news) featuring the game shows \"The Price Is Right\" and \"Let's Make a Deal\", soap operas \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", and talk show \"The Talk\".\n\nCBS News programming includes \"CBS This Morning\" from 7:00 to 9:00 a.m. weekdays and Saturdays; nightly editions of \"CBS Evening News\", the Sunday political talk show \"Face the Nation\", early morning news program \"CBS Morning News\". and the newsmagazines \"60 Minutes\", \"CBS News Sunday Morning\", and \"48 Hours\". Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" and \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\".\n\nCBS Sports programming is also provided most weekend afternoons. Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, CBS will occasionally delay scheduled primetime programs to allow the programs to air in their entirety, a practice that is most common on Sunday evenings during the NFL season. In addition to rights to sports events from the NFL, PGA and NCAA among other major sports organizations, CBS broadcasts the \"CBS Sports Spectacular\", a sports anthology series which fills certain weekend afternoon time slots prior to – or in some cases, in lieu of – a major sporting event.\n\nCBS's daytime schedule is the longest among the major networks at 4 hours. It is the home of the long-running game show \"The Price Is Right\", which began production in 1972 and is the longest continuously running daytime game show on network television. After being hosted by Bob Barker for 35 years, the show has been hosted since 2007 by actor/comedian Drew Carey. The network is also home to the current incarnation of \"Let's Make a Deal\", hosted by singer/comedian Wayne Brady.\n\n, CBS is the only commercial broadcast network that continues to broadcast daytime game shows. Notable game shows that once aired as part of the network's daytime lineup include \"Match Game\", \"Tattletales\", \"The $10/25,000 Pyramid\", \"Press Your Luck\", \"Card Sharks\", \"Family Feud\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\". Past game shows that have had both daytime and prime time runs on the network include \"Beat the Clock\", \"To Tell the Truth\" and \"Password\". Two long-running prime time-only games were the panel shows \"What's My Line?\" and \"I've Got a Secret\".\n\nThe network is also home to \"The Talk\", a panel talk show similar in format to ABC's \"The View\", which debuted in October 2010 (, the program is hosted by moderator Julie Chen, series creator/executive producer Sara Gilbert, Sharon Osbourne, Eve and Sheryl Underwood).\n\n, CBS Daytime airs two daytime soap operas each weekday: the hour-long series \"The Young and the Restless\" (debuted in 1973) and half-hour series \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (debuted in 1987). CBS has long aired the most soap operas out of the Big Three networks, carrying 3 hours of soaps on its daytime lineup from 1982 to 2009, and still retains the longest daily schedule. Other than \"Guiding Light\", notable daytime soap operas that once aired on CBS include \"As the World Turns\", \"Love of Life\", \"Search for Tomorrow\", \"The Secret Storm\", \"The Edge of Night\" and \"Capitol\".\n\nCBS broadcast the live-action series \"Captain Kangaroo\" on weekday mornings from 1955 to 1982, and on Saturdays through 1984. From 1971 to 1986, CBS News produced a series of one-minute segments titled \"In the News\", which aired between other Saturday morning programs. Otherwise, in regards to children's programming, CBS has aired mostly animated series for children, such as reruns of \"Mighty Mouse\", \"Bugs Bunny\" and \"Tom and Jerry\" cartoons, as well as the original version of \"Scooby-Doo\", \"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\", \"Jim Henson's Muppet Babies\", \"Garfield and Friends\", and the 1987 \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\". In 1997, CBS premiered \"Wheel 2000\" (a children's version of the syndicated game show \"Wheel of Fortune\"), which aired simultaneously on the Game Show Network.\n\nIn September 1998, CBS began contracting the time period out to other companies to provide programming and material for its Saturday morning schedule. The first of these outsourced blocks was the \"CBS Kidshow\", which ran until 2000 and featured programming from Canadian studio Nelvana (such as \"Anatole\", \"Mythic Warriors\", \"Rescue Heroes\" and \"Flying Rhino Junior High\").\n\nAfter its agreement with Nelvana ended, the network then entered into a deal with Nickelodeon (which by the time of the deal was a corporate sister to CBS, through the latter's then parent company Viacom, as a result of its 2000 merger with CBS Corporation) to air programming from its Nick Jr. block beginning in September 2000 under the banner \"Nick Jr. on CBS\". From 2002 to 2005, live-action and animated Nickelodeon series aimed at older children also aired as part of the block, under the sub-brand \"Nick on CBS\".\n\nFollowing the Viacom-CBS split that resulted in the network deciding to discontinue the Nickelodeon content deal, in March 2006, CBS entered into a three-year agreement with DIC Entertainment (which was acquired later that year by the Cookie Jar Group, which assumed the rights to the deal) to program the Saturday morning time slot as part of a deal that included distribution of select tape-delayed Formula One auto races. The \"KOL Secret Slumber Party on CBS\" replaced \"Nick Jr. on CBS\" that September, with the inaugural lineup featuring two new first-run live-action programs, one animated series that originally aired in syndication in 2005 and three shows produced prior to 2006. In mid-2007, KOL (the children's service of AOL) withdrew sponsorship from CBS's Saturday morning block, which was subsequently renamed \"KEWLopolis\". Complimenting CBS's 2007 lineup was \"Care Bears\", \"Strawberry Shortcake\" and \"Sushi Pack\". On February 24, 2009, it was announced that CBS renewed its contract with Cookie Jar for another three seasons, running through 2012. On September 19, 2009, \"KEWLopolis\" was renamed \"Cookie Jar TV\".\n\nOn July 24, 2013, CBS entered into an agreement with Litton Entertainment (which already programmed a syndicated Saturday morning block exclusive to ABC stations and would later produce a block for CBS sister network The CW that debuted the following year) to launch a new Saturday morning block featuring live-action reality-based lifestyle, wildlife and sports series. The Litton-produced \"CBS Dream Team\" block, which is aimed at teenagers 13 to 16 years old, debuted on September 28, 2013, replacing \"Cookie Jar TV\".\n\nCBS was the original broadcast network home of the animated primetime holiday specials based on the \"Peanuts\" comic strip, beginning with \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" in 1965. Over 30 holiday Peanuts specials (each for a specific holiday such as Halloween) were broadcast on CBS from that time until 2000, when the broadcast rights were acquired by ABC. CBS also aired several primetime animated specials based on the works of Dr. Seuss (Theodor Geisel), beginning with \"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\" in 1966, as well as several specials based on the \"Garfield\" comic strip during the 1980s (which led to Garfield getting his own Saturday morning cartoon on the network, \"Garfield and Friends\", which ran from 1988 to 1995). \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\", produced in stop motion by the Rankin/Bass studio, has been another annual holiday staple of CBS; however, that special originated on NBC in 1964. , \"Rudolph\" and \"Frosty the Snowman\" were the only two pre-1990 animated specials remaining on CBS; the broadcast rights to the \"Charlie Brown\" specials are now held by ABC, \"The Grinch\" rights are now held by NBC and the rights to the \"Garfield\" specials are now held by Boomerang.\n\nAll of these animated specials, from 1973 to 1990, began with a fondly remembered seven-second animated opening sequence, in which the words \"A CBS Special Presentation\" were displayed in colorful lettering (the ITC Avant Garde typeface, widely used in the 1970s, was used for the title logo). The word \"SPECIAL\", in all caps and repeated multiple times in multiple colors, slowly zoomed out from the frame in a spinning counterclockwise motion against a black background, and rapidly zoomed back into frame as a single word, in white, at the end; the sequence was accompanied by a jazzy though majestic up-tempo fanfare with dramatic horns and percussion (which was edited incidental music from the CBS crime drama \"Hawaii Five-O\", titled \"Call to Danger\" on the Capitol Records soundtrack LP). This opening sequence appeared immediately before all CBS specials of the period (such as the Miss USA pageants and the annual presentation of the Kennedy Center Honors), in addition to animated specials (this opening was presumably designed by, or under the supervision of, longtime CBS creative director Lou Dorfsman, who oversaw print and on-air graphics for CBS for nearly 30 years, replacing William Golden, who died in 1959).\n\nCBS was also responsible for airing the series of \"Young People's Concerts\" conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Telecast every few months between 1958 and 1972, first in black-and-white and then broadcast in color beginning in 1966, these programs introduced millions of children to classical music through the eloquent commentaries by Maestro Bernstein. The specials were nominated for several Emmy Awards including two wins in 1961 an later in 1966, and were among the first programs ever broadcast from Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nOver the years, CBS has broadcast three different productions of Tchaikovsky's famous ballet \"The Nutcracker\" – two live telecasts of the George Balanchine New York City Ballet production in 1957 and 1958 respectively, a little-known German-American filmed production in 1965 (which was subsequently repeated three times and starred Edward Villella, Patricia McBride and Melissa Hayden), and beginning in 1977, the Mikhail Baryshnikov staging of the ballet, starring the Russian dancer along with Gelsey Kirkland – a version that would become a television classic, and remains so today (the broadcast of this production later moved to PBS).\n\nIn April 1986, CBS presented a slightly abbreviated version of \"Horowitz in Moscow\", a live piano recital by legendary pianist Vladimir Horowitz, which marked Horowitz's return to Russia after more than 60 years. The recital was televised as an episode of \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" (televised at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time in the U.S., as the recital was performed simultaneously at 4:00 p.m. in Russia). It was so successful that CBS repeated it a mere two months later by popular demand, this time on videotape, rather than live. In later years, the program was shown as a standalone special on PBS; the current DVD of the telecast omits the commentary by Charles Kuralt, but includes additional selections not heard on the CBS telecast.\n\nIn 1986, CBS telecast \"Carnegie Hall: The Grand Reopening\" in primetime, in what was now a rare move for a commercial broadcast network, since most primetime classical music specials were relegated to PBS and A&E by this time. The program was a concert commemorating the re-opening of Carnegie Hall after its complete renovation. It featured, along with luminaries such as Leonard Bernstein, popular music artists such as Frank Sinatra.\n\nIn order to compete with NBC, which produced the now-legendary televised version of the Mary Martin Broadway production of \"Peter Pan\", CBS responded with a musical production of \"Cinderella\", with music composed by Richard Rodgers and a book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II. Based upon the classic Charles Perrault fairy tale of the same title, it is the only Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ever to have been written for television. It was originally broadcast live in color on CBS on March 31, 1957 as a vehicle for Julie Andrews, who played the title role; that broadcast was seen by over 100 million people. It was subsequently remade by CBS in 1965, with Lesley Ann Warren, Stuart Damon, Ginger Rogers and Walter Pidgeon among its stars; the remake also included a new song, \"Loneliness of Evening\", which was originally composed in 1949 for \"South Pacific\", but was not performed in that musical. This version was rebroadcast several times on CBS into the early 1970s, and is occasionally broadcast on various cable networks to this day; both versions are available on DVD.\n\nCBS was also the original broadcast home for the primetime specials produced by the National Geographic Society. The Geographic series in the U.S. started on CBS in 1964, before moving to ABC in 1973 (the specials subsequently moved to PBS – under the production of Pittsburgh member station WQED – in 1975 and NBC in 1995, before returning to PBS in 2000). The specials have featured stories on many scientific figures such as Louis Leakey, Jacques Cousteau and Jane Goodall, that not only featured their work but helped make them internationally known and accessible to millions. A majority of the specials were narrated by various actors, notably Alexander Scourby during the CBS run. The success of the specials led in part to the creation of the National Geographic Channel, a cable channel launched in January 2001 as a joint venture between the National Geographic Society and Fox Cable Networks. The specials' distinctive theme music, by Elmer Bernstein, was also adopted by the National Geographic Channel.\n\nFrom 1949 to 2002, the Pillsbury Bake-Off, an annual national cooking contest, was broadcast on CBS as a special. Hosts for the broadcast included Arthur Godfrey, Art Linkletter, Bob Barker, Gary Collins, Willard Scott (although under contract with CBS's rival NBC) and Alex Trebek.\n\nThe Miss USA beauty pageant aired on CBS from 1963 to 2002; during a large portion of that period, the telecast was often emceed by the host of one of the network's game shows. John Charles Daly hosted the show from 1963 to 1966, succeeded by Bob Barker from 1967 to 1987 (at which point Barker, an animal rights activist who eventually convinced producers of \"The Price Is Right\" to cease offering fur coats as prizes on the program, quit in a dispute over their use), Alan Thicke in 1988, Dick Clark from 1989 to 1993, and Bob Goen from 1994 to 1996. The pageant's highest viewership was recorded in the early 1980s, when it regularly topped the Nielsen ratings on the week of its broadcast. Viewership dropped sharply throughout the 1990s and 2000s, from an estimated viewership of 20 million to an average of 7 million from 2000 to 2001. In 2002, Donald Trump (owner of the Miss USA pageant's governing body, the Miss Universe Organization) brokered a new deal with NBC, giving it half-ownership of the Miss USA, Miss Universe and Miss Teen USA pageants and moving them to that network as part of an initial five-year contract, which began in 2003 and ended in 2015 after 12 years amid Trump's controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants during the launch of his 2016 campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination.\n\nOn June 1, 1977, it was announced that Elvis Presley had signed a deal with CBS to appear in a new television special. Under the agreement, CBS would videotape Presley's concerts during the summer of 1977; the special was filmed during Presley's final tour at stops in Omaha, Nebraska (on June 19) and Rapid City, South Dakota (on June 21 of that year). CBS aired the special, \"Elvis in Concert\", on October 3, 1977, nearly two months after Presley's death in his Graceland mansion on August 16.\n\nCBS has 15 owned-and-operated stations, and current and pending affiliation agreements with 228 additional television stations encompassing 51 states, the District of Columbia, two U.S. possessions, Bermuda and St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The network has a national reach of 95.96% of all households in the United States (or 299,861,665 Americans with at least one television set). Currently, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Delaware are the only U.S. states where CBS does not have a locally licensed affiliate (New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WCBS-TV and Philadelphia O&O KYW-TV; Delaware is served by KYW and Salisbury, Maryland affiliate WBOC-TV; and New Hampshire is served by Boston O&O WBZ-TV and Burlington, Vermont affiliate WCAX-TV).\n\nCBS maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few markets, such as Harrisonburg, Virginia (WSVF-CD), Palm Springs, California (KPSP-CD) and Parkersburg, West Virginia (WIYE-LD). In some markets, including both of those mentioned, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station. CBS also maintains a sizeable number of subchannel-only affiliations, the majority of which are with stations in cities located outside of the 50 largest Nielsen-designated markets; the largest CBS subchannel affiliate by market size is KOGG in Wailuku, Hawaii, which serves as a repeater of Honolulu affiliate KGMB (the sister station of KOGG parent KHNL).\n\nNexstar Media Group is the largest operator of CBS stations by numerical total, owning 49 CBS affiliates (counting satellites); Tegna Media is the largest operator of CBS stations in terms of overall market reach, owning 15 CBS-affiliated stations (including affiliates in the larger markets in Houston, Tampa and Washington, D.C.) that reach 8.9% of the country.\n\nCBS provides video on demand access for delayed viewing of the network's programming through various means, including via its website at CBS.com; the network's apps for iOS, Android and newer version Windows devices; a traditional VOD service called CBS on Demand available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers; and through content deals with Amazon Video (which holds exclusive streaming rights to two CBS drama series, \"Extant\" and \"Under the Dome\") and Netflix. Notably, however, CBS is the only major broadcast network that does not provide recent episodes of its programming on Hulu (sister network The CW does offer its programming on the streaming service, albeit on a one-week delay after becoming available on the network's website on Hulu's free service, with users of its subscription service being granted access to newer episodes of CW series eight hours after their initial broadcast), due to concerns over cannibalizing viewership of some of the network's most prominent programs; however, episode back catalogs of certain past and present CBS series are available on the service through an agreement with CBS Television Distribution.\n\nUpon the release of the app in March 2013, CBS restricted streaming of the most recent episode of any of the network's program on its streaming app for Apple iOS devices until eight days after their initial broadcast, in order to encourage live or same-week (via both DVR and cable on demand) viewing; programming selections on the app were limited until the release of its Google Play and Windows 8 apps in October 2013, expanded the selections to include full episodes of all CBS series to which the network does not license the streaming rights to other services.\n\nOn October 28, 2014, CBS launched CBS All Access, an over-the-top subscription streaming service – priced at $5.99 per month ($9.99 with the no commercials option) – which allows users to view past and present episodes of CBS shows. Announced on October 16, 2014 (one day after HBO announced the launch of its over-the-top service HBO Now) as the first OTT offering by a USA broadcast television network, the service initially encompassed the network's existing streaming portal at CBS.com and its mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers; CBS All Access became available on Roku on April 7, 2015, and on Chromecast on May 14, 2015. In addition to providing full-length episodes of CBS programs, the service allows live programming streams of local CBS affiliates in 124 markets reaching 75% of the United States.\n\nCBS All Access offers the most recent episodes of the network's shows the day after their original broadcast, as well as complete back catalogs of most of its current series and a wide selection of episodes of classic series from the CBS Television Distribution program library, to subscribers of the service. CBS All Access also carries behind-the-scenes features from CBS programs and special events.\n\nOriginal programs expected to air on CBS All Access include a , a spin-off of \"The Good Wife\", and an online version of \"Big Brother\".\n\nCBS's master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution format for CBS Corporation's television properties. However, seven of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in 720p HD, while seven others carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry CBS programming on a digital subchannel or because a primary feed CBS affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nCBS began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, CBS HD, on September 1998 at the start of the 1998–99 season. That year, the network aired the first NFL game ever broadcast in high-definition, with the telecast of the New York Jets–Buffalo Bills game on November 8. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from standard-definition to high definition beginning with the 2000–01 season, with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts. \"The Young and the Restless\" became the first daytime soap opera to broadcast in HD on June 27, 2001.\n\nCBS's 14-year conversion to an entirely high definition schedule ended in 2014, with \"Big Brother\" and \"Let's Make a Deal\" becoming the final two network series to convert from standard definition to HD (in contrast, NBC, Fox and The CW were already airing their entire programming schedules – outside of Saturday mornings – in high definition by the 2010–11 season, while ABC was broadcasting its entire schedule in HD by the 2011–12 midseason). All of the network's programming has been presented in full HD since then (with the exception of certain holiday specials produced prior to 2005 – such as the Rankin-Bass specials – which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).\n\nOn September 1, 2016, when ABC converted to a widescreen presentation, CBS and The CW were the only remaining networks which frame their promotions and on-screen graphical elements for a presentation, though with CBS Sports's \"de facto\" 16:9 conversion with Super Bowl 50 and their new graphical presentation designed for 16:9 framing, in practice most CBS affiliates ask pay-TV providers to pass down a 16:9 widescreen presentation by default over their standard definition channels. This continued for CBS until September 24, 2018 when the network converted its on-screen graphical elements to a 16:9 widescreen presentation for all non-news and sports programs; although it still operates on a 4:3 presentation for the CBS Dream Team block.\n\nThe CBS television network's initial logo, used from the 1940s to 1951, consisted of an oval spotlight which shone on the block letters \"C-B-S\". The present-day Eye device was conceived by William Golden, based on a Pennsylvania Dutch hex sign as well as a Shaker drawing (while commonly attributed to Golden, there is speculation that at least some design work on the symbol may have been done by another CBS staff designer, Georg Olden, one of the first African-Americans to attract some attention in the postwar graphic design field). The Eye device made its broadcast debut on October 20, 1951. The following season, as Golden prepared a new \"ident\", CBS President Frank Stanton insisted on keeping the Eye device and using it as much as possible (Golden died unexpectedly in 1959, and was replaced by one of his top assistants, Lou Dorfsman, who would go on to oversee all print and on-air graphics for CBS for the next 30 years).\n\nThe CBS eye has since become an American icon. While the symbol's settings have changed, the Eye device itself has not been redesigned in its entire history. As part of a new graphical identity created by Trollbäck + Company that was introduced by the television network in 2006, the eye was placed in a \"trademark\" position on show titles, days of the week and descriptive words, an approach highly respecting the value of the design. The logo is alternately known as the \"Eyemark\", which was also the name of CBS's domestic and international syndication divisions in the mid-to-late 1990s before the King World acquisition and Viacom merger.\n\nThe eye logo has frequently been copied or borrowed by television networks around the world. Notable examples include the Austrian Broadcasting System (ORF), which formerly used a red version of the eye logo; Associated Television (ATV) in the United Kingdom; Frecuencia Latina in Peru; Fuji Television in Japan; Rede Bandeirantes and Rede Globo in Brazil; and Saeta TV Channel 10 in Uruguay.\n\nThe network celebrated the 60th anniversary of the introduction of the Eye logo in October 2011, featuring special IDs shown during the network's prime time lineup of logo versions from previous CBS image campaigns.\n\nThe standard corporate typeface used by CBS since the 1950s is \"Didot\", a close relative to \"Bodoni\". Several of the typefaces used by CBS over the years were designed by Herb Lubalin of International Typeface Corporation, an associate of CBS art director Lou Dorfsman. These typefaces include \"Avant Garde\", \"Lubalin Graph\", and \"Serif Gothic\".\n\nThrough the years, CBS has developed several notable image campaigns, and several of the network's most well-known slogans were introduced in the 1980s. The \"Reach for the Stars\" campaign used during the 1981–82 season feature a space theme used to capitalize on both CBS's stellar improvement in the ratings and the historic launch of the space shuttle Columbia. 1982's \"Great Moments\" juxtaposed scenes from classic CBS programs such as \"I Love Lucy\" with scenes from the network's then-current classics such as \"Dallas\" and \"M*A*S*H\". From 1983 to 1986, CBS (by now firmly atop the ratings) featured a campaign based on the slogan \"We've Got the Touch\". Vocals for the campaign's jingle were contributed by Richie Havens (1983–84; one occasion in 1984–85) and Kenny Rogers (1985–86).\n\nThe 1986–87 season ushered in the \"Share the Spirit of CBS\" campaign, the network's first to completely use computer graphics and DVE effects. Unlike most network campaign promos, the full-length version of \"Share the Spirit\" not only showed a brief clip preview of each new fall series, but also utilized CGI effects to map out the entire fall schedule by night. The success of that campaign led to the 1987–88 \"CBS Spirit\" (or \"CBSPIRIT\") campaign. Like with its predecessor campaign, most \"CBSpirit\" promos utilized a procession of clips from the network's programs. However, the new graphic motif was a swirling (or \"swishing\") blue line, that was used to represent \"the spirit.\" The full length promo, like the previous year, had a special portion that identified new fall shows, but the mapped-out fall schedule shot was abandoned.\n\nFor the 1988–89 season, CBS unveiled a new image campaign, officially known as \"Television You Can Feel\", but more commonly identified as \"You Can Feel It On CBS\". The goal was to convey a more sensual, new-age image through distinguished, advanced-looking computer graphics and soothing music, backgrounding images and clips of emotionally powerful scenes and characters. However, it was this season in which CBS began its ratings freefall, the deepest in the network's history. CBS ended the decade with \"Get Ready for CBS,\" introduced with the 1989–90 season. The initial version was a very ambitious campaign that attempted to elevate CBS out of last place (among the major networks); the motif centered around network stars interacting with each other in a remote studio set, getting ready for photo and television shoots, as well as for the new season on CBS. The high-energy promo song and the campaign's practices saw many customized variations by all of CBS's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates, which participated in the campaign per a network mandate. In addition, for the first time in history, CBS became the first broadcast network to partner with a national retailer (in this case, Kmart) to encourage viewership, with the \"CBS/Kmart Get Ready Giveaway\".\n\nFor the 1990–91 season, the campaign featured a new jingle performed by The Temptations, which offered an altered version of their hit \"Get Ready\". The early 1990s featured less-than-memorable campaigns, with simplified taglines such as \"This is CBS\" (1992) and \"You're On CBS\" (1995). Eventually, the promotions department gained momentum again late in the decade with \"Welcome Home to a CBS Night\" (1996–1997), simplified to \"Welcome Home\" (1997–1999) and succeeded by the spin-off campaign \"The Address is CBS\" (1999–2000), whose history can be traced back to a CBS slogan from the radio era of the 1940s, \"The Stars' Address is CBS\". During the 1992 season for the end-of-show network identification sequence, a three-note sound mark was introduced, which was eventually adapted into the network's IDs and production company vanity cards following the closing credits of most of its programs during the \"Welcome Home\" era.\n\nThroughout the first decade of the 21st century, CBS's ratings resurgence was backed by the network's \"It's All Here\" campaign (which introduced updated versions of the 1992 sound mark used during certain promotions and production company vanity cards during the closing credits of programs); in 2005, the network's strategy led to the proclamation that it was \"America's Most Watched Network\". The network's 2006 campaign introduced the slogan \"We Are CBS\", with Don LaFontaine providing the voiceover for the IDs (as well as certain network promos) during this period. In 2009, the network introduced a campaign entitled \"Only CBS,\" in which network promotions proclaim several unique qualities it has (the slogan was also used in program promotions following the announcement of the timeslot of a particular program). The \"America's Most Watched Network\" was re-introduced by CBS in 2011, used alongside the \"Only CBS\" slogan.\n\nEspecially during the 1960s, CBS as well as its two major network competitors, NBC, and ABC, utilized elaborate promos during the summer months to promote their upcoming fall schedules. In 1961, CBS took the unusual step of airing a program titled \"CBS Fall Preview Special: Seven Wonderful Nights\", using stars of several CBS shows – such as Ed Sullivan (\"The Ed Sullivan Show\"), Rod Serling (\"The Twilight Zone\"), and Raymond Burr and Barbara Hale (\"Perry Mason\") – to promote the upcoming fall lineup, instead the network's continuity announcers, showing previews of the entire lineup for one specific day of the week. Fall preview specials hosted by network stars would become commonplace among the broadcast networks in subsequent years.\n\nCBS programs are shown outside the United States, through various branded international networks and content agreements, and in two North American countries, through U.S.-based CBS stations.\n\nIn Canada, CBS network programming is carried on cable, satellite and IPTV providers in Canada through affiliates and owned-and-operated stations of the network that are located within proximity to the Canada–United States border (such as KIRO-TV/Seattle, KBJR-DT2/Duluth, Minnesota, WWJ-TV/Detroit and WIVB-TV/Buffalo, New York and WCAX-TV/Burlington, Vermont ), some of which may also be receivable over-the-air in parts of southern Canada depending on the signal coverage of the station. Most programming is generally the same as it airs in the United States; however, some CBS programming on U.S.-based affiliates permitted for carriage by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission by Canadian cable and satellite providers are subject to simultaneous substitutions, a practice in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue.\n\nIn Bermuda, CBS maintains an affiliation with Hamilton-based ZBM-TV, locally owned by Bermuda Broadcasting Company.\n\nCBS programming is available in Mexico through affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico–United States border (such as KSWT/Yuma, Arizona; KVTV/Laredo, Texas; KDBC-TV/El Paso, Texas; KGBT-TV/Harlingen, Texas; and KFMB-TV/San Diego), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico.\n\nSky News broadcasts the \"CBS Evening News\" on its channels serving the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Italy.\n\nOn September 14, 2009, the international arm of CBS, CBS Studios International, reached a joint venture deal with Chellomedia to launch six CBS-branded channels in the United Kingdom – which would respectively replace Zone Romantica, Zone Thriller, Zone Horror and Zone Reality, as well as timeshift services Zone Horror +1 and Zone Reality +1 – during the fourth quarter of that year. On October 1, 2009, it was announced that the first four channels, CBS Reality, CBS Reality +1, CBS Drama and CBS Action, would launch on November 16 – respectively replacing Zone Reality, Zone Reality +1, Zone Romantica and Zone Thriller. On April 5, 2010, Zone Horror and Zone Horror +1 were rebranded as Horror Channel and Horror Channel +1.\n\nCBS News and BBC News have maintained a news sharing agreement since 2017, replacing the BBC's longtime agreement with ABC News and CBS's with Sky News (which would have ended in any event in 2018 due to that entity's purchase by NBCUniversal).\n\nAs of the close of the Viacom merger on December 4, 2019, Channel 5 is now a sister operation to CBS, though no major changes to CBS's relationship with the BBC are expected in the near future, as Channel 5 sub-contracts its news programming obligations to ITN.\n\nAustralian free-to-air broadcaster Network Ten has been owned by CBS Corporation since 2017. Network Ten's three channels, 10, 10 Peach and 10 Bold, all carry CBS programming. Prior to the acquisition, CBS had long been a major supplier of international programs to the network. The cost of maintaining program supply agreements with CBS and 21st Century Fox was a major factor in the network's unprofitability during the mid-2010s. Network Ten entered voluntary administration in June 2017. CBS Corporation was the network's largest creditor. CBS Corporation chose to acquire the network, completing the transaction in November 2017.\n\nIn the U.S. territory of Guam, the network is affiliated with low-power station KUAM-LP in Hagåtña. Entertainment and non-breaking news programming is shown day and date on a one-day tape delay, as Guam is located on the west side of the International Date Line (for example, \"NCIS\", which airs on Tuesday nights, is carried Wednesdays on KUAM-LP, and is advertised by the station as airing on the latter night in on-air promotions), with live programming and breaking news coverage airing as scheduled, meaning live sports coverage often airs early in the morning.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the \"CBS Evening News\" was broadcast live during the early morning hours on ATV; networks in that country maintains agreement to rebroadcast portions of the program 12 hours after the initial broadcast to provide additional content in the event that their affiliates have insufficient news content to fill time during their local news programs.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"CBS Evening News\" is broadcast on satellite network Q (a sister channel of GMA Network which is now GMA News TV), while \"CBS This Morning\" is shown in that country on Lifestyle Network (now Metro Channel). The \"Late Show with David Letterman\" is broadcast by Studio 23 (now S+A) and Maxxx, which are both owned by ABS-CBN. 60 Minutes is currently broadcast on CNN Philippines as a part of their Stories block, which includes documentaries and is broadcast on Wednesday at 8:00 p.m. before CNN Philippines Nightly News with replays in a capacity as a stand-alone program on Saturdays at 8:00 a.m. & 5:00 pm and Sundays at 6:00 a.m, all in local time (UTC + 8).\nWith the merger of RTL it is known as RTL CBS Entertainment.\n\nIn India, CBS maintained a brand licensing agreement with Reliance Broadcast Network Ltd. for three CBS-branded channels: Big CBS Prime, Big CBS Spark and Big CBS Love. These channels were shut down in late November 2013.\n\nIn Israel, in 2012 the channels Zone Reality and Zone Romanatica have been rebranded as CBS Reality and CBS Drama, respectively. The channels were carried by Israeli television providers yes and HOT, although they both only carry CBS Reality.\n\nIn 1995, CBS refused to air a \"60 Minutes\" segment that featured an interview with a former president of research and development for Brown & Williamson, the U.S.'s third largest tobacco company. The controversy raised questions about the legal roles in decision-making and whether journalistic standards should be compromised despite legal pressures and threats. The decision nevertheless sent shockwaves throughout the television industry, the journalism community, and the country. This incident was the basis for the 1999 Michael Mann-directed drama film, \"The Insider\".\n\nIn 2004, the Federal Communications Commission imposed a record $550,000 fine, the largest fine ever for a violation of federal decency laws, against CBS for an incident during its broadcast of Super Bowl XXXVIII in which singer Janet Jackson's right breast (which was partially covered by a piece of nipple jewelry) was briefly and accidentally exposed by guest performer Justin Timberlake at the end of a duet performance of Timberlake's 2003 single \"Rock Your Body\" during the halftime show (produced by then sister cable network MTV). Following the incident, CBS apologized to its viewers and denied foreknowledge of the incident, which was televised live. The incident resulted in a period of increased regulation of broadcast television and radio outlets (including self-imposed content regulation by networks and syndicators), which raised concerns surrounding censorship and freedom of speech, and resulted in the FCC voting to increase its maximum fine for indecency violations from US$27,500 to US$325,000. In 2008, a Philadelphia federal court annulled the fine imposed on CBS, labelling it \"arbitrary and capricious\".\n\nOn September 8, 2004, less than two months before the Presidential election in which he defeated Democratic candidate John Kerry, CBS aired a controversial episode of \"60 Minutes Wednesday\", which questioned then-President George W. Bush's service in the Air National Guard in 1972 and 1973. Following allegations of forgery, CBS News admitted that four of the documents used in the story had not been properly authenticated and admitted that their source, Bill Burkett, had admitted to having \"deliberately misled\" a CBS News producer who worked on the report, about the documents' origins out of a confidentiality promise to the actual source. The following January, CBS fired four people connected to the preparation of the segment. Former CBS news anchor Dan Rather filed a $70 million lawsuit against CBS and former corporate parent Viacom in September 2007, contending the story, and his termination (he resigned as CBS News chief anchor in 2005), were mishandled. Parts of the suit were dismissed in 2008; subsequently in 2010, the entire suit was dismissed and Rather's motion to appeal was denied.\n\nIn January 2013, CNET named Dish Network's \"Hopper with Sling\" digital video recorder as a nominee for the CES \"Best in Show\" award (which is decided by CNET on behalf of its organizers, the Consumer Electronics Association), and named it the winner in a vote by the site's staff. However, CBS division CBS Interactive disqualified the Hopper, and vetoed the results as CBS was in active litigation with Dish Network over its AutoHop technology (which allows users to skip commercial advertisements during recorded programs). CNET announced that it would no longer review any product or service provided by companies that CBS Corporation was in litigation with. The \"Best in Show\" award was instead given to the Razer Edge tablet. On January 14, 2013, CNET editor-in-chief Lindsey Turrentine said in a statement that its staff was in an \"impossible\" situation due to the conflict of interest posed by the lawsuit, and promised to prevent a similar incident from occurring again. The conflict also prompted the resignation of CNET senior writer Greg Sandoval. As a result of the controversy, the CEA announced on January 31, 2013 that CNET will no longer decide the CES Best in Show award winner due to the interference of CBS (with the position being offered to other technology publications), and the \"Best in Show\" award was jointly awarded to both the Hopper with Sling and Razer Edge.\n\nIn July 2018, an article by Ronan Farrow in \"The New Yorker\" claimed that thirty \"current and former CBS employees described harassment, gender discrimination, or retaliation\" at CBS and six women accused Les Moonves of harassment and intimidation. Following these allegations, it was reported on September 6, 2018 that CBS board members were negotiating Les Moonves's departure from the company.\n\nOn September 9, 2018, \"The New Yorker\" reported that six additional women (in addition to the six original women reported in July) had raised accusations against Moonves, going back to the 1980s. Following this, Moonves resigned the same day as chief executive of CBS.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "77894", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77894", "title": "China Central Television", "text": "China Central Television\n\nChina Central Television (CCTV) is the predominant public television network in Mainland China. CCTV has a network of 50 channels broadcasting different programmes and is accessible to more than one billion viewers. As of present, there are 50 television channels, and the broadcaster provides programming in six different languages. Most of its programmes are a mixture of news, documentary, social education, comedy, entertainment, and drama, the majority of which consists of Chinese soap operas and entertainment. It was established on May 1, 1958, and it is a news and public opinion organization, and an ideological and cultural front in China. CCTV has a variety of functions, such as news communication, social education, culture, and entertainment information services. As a state television station it is responsible to both the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.\n\nIn 1954, President and Party Chairman Mao Zedong put forward that China should establish its own TV station. On February 5, 1955, the central broadcasting bureau reported to the State Council and proposed the program of establishing a medium-sized television station, later on premier Zhou Enlai included in China’s first five-year plan the planend introduction of television broadcasts. In December 1957, the central broadcasting bureau sent Luo Donghe and Meng Qiyu to the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic in March 1958 for the inspection of their TV stations, then the duo returned to Beijing to prepare for the establishment of the promised TV station.\n\nAt 19:00 on May 1, 1958; Beijing Television (the predecessor of China Central Television) experimented with broadcasting, and for the first time, China's own TV signals were broadcast in Beijing. On the screens of the few dozen television receivers in Beijing that night, a picture of the headquarters building with the words \"Beijing TV station\" written on it appeared. On September 2 of that year, BTV broadcast officially for the first time. Later the number of official TV programs has increased from twice a week to four times a week (on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday and Sunday).\n\nFrom January 1, 1960; BTV changed the fixed program schedule and started to broadcast eight times a week and added one program on Sunday morning. BTV also set up a dozen fixed TV shows in order to cater to the vast audiences, the shows include news columns and entertainment shows. The media function of TV had extended further. In May of the same year, the construction of the \"new building\" in the courtyard of the headquarters was completed. Due to increasing demands, it soon launched its second channel in 1963 and third channel in 1969, followed by the first simultaneous satellite broadcasts nationwide in 1972.\n\nStarting from 1 May 1973, Beijing Television began broadcasting experimentally in color on its second channel every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday using the PAL-D system, and fully converted to color broadcasting by 1977. On January 1, 1978; its flagship news broadcasts were officially launched. On May 1 of the same year, with the approval of the CPC Central Committee, BTV, which celebrated its 20th anniversary was officially renamed CCTV (China Central Television, ) and a new logomark debuted. In 1979, the iconic butterfly logo made its debut, which would be used as the corporate identity of the CCTV network for the next two decades.\n\nUntil the late 1970s, CCTV held only evening broadcasts, usually closing down at midnight. During the summer and winter academic vacations, it occasionally transmitted daytime programming for students, while special daytime programs were aired during national holidays. In 1980 CCTV experimented with news relays from local and central television studios via microwave. By 1985, CCTV had already become a leading television network in China. In 1987 CCTV's popularity soared due to the adaptation and presentation of \"Dream of the Red Chamber\". The 36-episode TV series—the first Chinese television drama to enter the global market— still remains popular in the international market. In the same year, CCTV exported 10,216 programmes to 77 foreign television stations.\n\nInitially, the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee issued directive censorship of programs. During reform in the 1990s, the Party adopted new standards for CCTV, \"affordability\" and \"acceptability\", loosening the previous government control. Affordability refers to purchasing ability of programs, while acceptability requires that a program has acceptable content, preventing the broadcast of material that contains inappropriate content or expresses views against the Communist Party of China.\n\nOn 2 September 2008, the new CCTV Headquarters was opened on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of CCTV.\n\nIn July 2009 CCTV expanded its coverage and target audience by launching CCTV-العربية, its international channel in Arabic language.\n\nToday, CCTV has 24 channels, most of them airing 24 hours a day. On 17 June 2013, CCTV announced that most of the broadcast facilities for the CCTV network have been relocated to the current headquarters building.\n\nOn 31 December 2016, China Central Television's foreign language services were spun off into China Global Television Network (CGTN).\n\nIn March 2018, as the nation began marking the 60th year of television, CCTV ownership changed hands to a new state holding group, the China Media Group, as the television arm of the newly launched multimedia broadcasting conglomerate operated by both the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council.\n\nChina Central Television falls under the supervision of the State Administration of Radio, Film, and Television which is in turn subordinate to the State Council of the People's Republic of China. A Vice Minister of the state council serves as chairman of CCTV. The organisation has relationships with regional television stations run by local governments, which must reserve up to two channels for the national broadcaster.\n\nThe organization is considered one of the \"big three\" media outlets in China, along with the \"People's Daily\" and Xinhua.\n\nThe current president of CCTV is Shen Haixiong, who was appointed in February 2018.\n\nChina Network Television (CNTV) is an internet-based broadcaster of China Central Television which launched on 28 December 2009. CNTV offers six foreign languages services, including English, French, Spanish, Russian, Korean, and Arabic. Official website is www.cctv.com, supported by CCTV International Network Co., Ltd. (Chinese:央视国际网络有限公司)\n\nCCTV produces its own news broadcasts three times a day and is the country's most powerful and prolific television program producer.\nIts thirty-minute evening news, \"Xinwen Lianbo\" (\"CCTV Network News\" or \"CCTV Tonight\", ), goes on air daily at 7:00 pm Beijing time. All local stations are required to carry CCTV's news broadcast. An internal CCTV survey indicates that nearly 500 million people countrywide regularly watch this program. However, the figure has slumped in recent years; the program now has 10% of the ratings market, compared to 40% before 1998.\n\nAlthough news reform has been a prominent feature of CCTV networks, the Evening News has remained relatively the same since its first appearance in the early 1980s. Many important political news stories are broadcast through the program.\n\n\"Focus\", first introduced in 1994, is a popular programme on CCTV. This discussion programme regularly exposes the wrongdoings of local officials, which attracts serious attention from higher levels of government. The programme also exposes the Chinese Government's response to the charges of corruption.\n\nThe \"CCTV New Year's Gala\" ()—a yearly special program for the Chinese New Year—is the most-watched CCTV programme.\n\nIn 2003 CCTV launched its first 24-hour news channel, initially available to cable viewers.\n\nProducing a variety of different programming, China Central Television has a number of different program hosts, news anchors, correspondents, and contributors who appear throughout daily programing on the network.\n\nThe CCTV channels are listed in sequential order with no discerning descriptions, e.g. CCTV-1, CCTV-2, etc., similar to those channels in Europe and in other places around the world.\n\nAll CCTV channels are independently broadcast. The following 16 channels are public channels, it means that the channels are free, audience only need pay the ratings for the maintenance to the local cable without pay subscription fees. The following is list of the channels with their names:\n\nCCTV was one of the six participants of China 3D TV Test Channel (), a television channel broadcasting various digital 3D television content.In 2018,the China 3D TV Test Channel was shut down and replaced by CCTV-4K Channel.\n\nThe following 18 channels are pay channels:\n\nAll CCTV channels are also broadcast via the following:\n\nAll CCTV channels are broadcast 24 hours a day except the following channels, the broadcast time of each channels:\nEvery day at 5:55 CST the March of the Volunteers (National Anthem of China) plays on most channels (except for International Channels and Pay Channels).\n\nIn 2001, \"going out\" program was launched by Xu Guangchun, the head of SARFT, also the deputy head of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China after the urgency of bringing the voice of China to the world was presented by Jiang Zemin, former president of China. The idea of an English channel was brought out in 1996. CCTV-4 had three half-hour English news broadcasting every day, but later, on 25 September 2000, CCTV-9 a satellite channel was set up to be the first 24-hour English channel, aimed to establish the overseas market. In October 2001, CCTV had partnered with AOL Time Warner and other news corporation. CCTV had given those corporation access to the Chinese media market in exchange for cable delivery in US and Europe, mainly delivering CCTV-9 programs.\n\nCurrently CCTV has 10 channels broadcasting around the world (CCTV-娱乐 (Entertainment), CCTV-戏曲 (Chinese Opera International), CCTV-13, CCTV-4 in Chinese, CCTV-NEWS and CCTV-9 Documentary) in English, CCTV-Français in French, CCTV-Español in Spanish, CCTV-العربية in Arabic, and CCTV-Русский in Russian. CCTV-4 ASIA used Japanese in Japan. A Portuguese channel is planned in the near future.\n\nThe CCTV-4 channel split into three separate channels on 1 April 2007—each serves different time zones: China Standard Time (CST), Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and Eastern Standard Time (EST) in order to improve service for audiences around the world.\n\nOn 25 July 2009, CCTV launched its Arabic-language international channel, stating that it aims to maintain stronger links with Arabic nations. \"Dialogue, China Story, Documentary, and Science & Technology Review\" is a program that air on CCTV-A six time a day. The Arabic Channel serves the Middle East, North Africa, and the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nOn 10 September 2009 CCTV began broadcasting its Russian-language channel.\n\nIn 2007, China's television audience rose to 1.2 billion. The 2008 Summer Olympics coverage on CCTV resulted in an aggregate 41% audience share across its network. As content becomes more diversified, there have been concerns about the audience share, as CCTV is losing out to cable, satellite and regional networks. In Guangzhou for example, CCTV programming only accounts for 45% of the weekly audience share, while in Shanghai, local stations also have share over CCTV. However, the \"CCTV New Year's Gala\" remains extremely popular; it acquires more than 90% audience share over the nation.\n\nThe network's principal directors and other officers are appointed by the State, and so are the top officials at local conventional television stations in mainland China; nearly all of them are restricted to broadcasting within their own province or municipality. Editorial independence is subject to government policy considerations, and as a result, it has been charged with being \"propaganda aimed at brainwashing the audience\" in its history and news programmes in a letter written by a number of Chinese intellectuals who also called for a boycott of state media was posted on a US-based website and has circulated through Chinese websites.The network often publishes misleading and false information, particularly as it pertains to issues considered sensitive by the Chinese government. However only a small percentage of the Network’s programming can be described as \"abusive or demonizing propaganda.\"\n\nJournalists working for the network's English-language international channel, CGTN, as well as of the other non-Chinese language TV channels under the CGTN banner, are under constant pressure to present a positive account of China, according to Anne-Marie Brady's study published in 2008. \"In August 2005, a series of items reported factually on the coal mining disaster in China; soon after the channel's leaders received a warning from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that its reports were harming China's international image. Following this incident, senior editorial staff and journalists were all forced to write self-criticisms.\"\n\nBrady says that while the channel's equipment is state-of-the-art, the employees are not well trained in how to use it, so there are frequent errors during a broadcast. \"The political controls on the station contribute to a generally low level of morale and initiative among station staff,\" she writes.\n\nA recent study done by the observer of Chinese film and television, Ying Zhu, suggests that \"CCTV is full of serious-minded creators who regularly experience bouts of self-doubt, philosophical ambivalence, and in some cases, clinical depression.\" During her extensive interviews with key CCTV players, Zhu notes that \"Certain common themes, about ideals, distorted or altogether thwarted by commercial and political pressure, emerged.\"\n\nOne of the earliest recorded uses of the Network for both domestic and international propaganda purposes occurred in 1999 during the first crackdown on the Falun Gong meditation and spiritual movement. During one 32 day period in 1999 \"Focus Talk\" ran 28 episodes which defamed practitioners and incited hatred against them.\n\nOn 27 December 2007, Xinwen Lianbo aired a report about the wide and easy availability of explicit content on the internet. The report appealed to juristic institutions and government to hurry to make relevant legislation in order to purify the internet environment. In the report, a young student described a pop-up advertisement she saw as being \"very erotic very violent\". After the airing of the report, many parodies were posted by internet users ridiculing the comment and CCTV's credibility in part. The incident also questioned the reliability of \"Xinwen Lianbo\", noting the unlikelihood of a web page being both violent and erotic at the same time (even though such pages do exist), and the age of the student interviewed. Personal information of the interviewed girl was later also leaked, identifying the girl in the report by name. Online message boards were populated by large threads about the incident, and a satirical work even stated that CCTV's website was the number one \"very erotic very violent\" website on the internet, with some users even creating their own toplists of sites which meet these criteria, the \"top 8 very erotic very violent sports events\" and even identifying things that are yellow as being erotic (since 黄, \"huáng\", the Chinese character for \"yellow\", also means \"erotic\").\n\nOn 23 January 2011 the CCTV news program Xinwen Lianbo showcased the Chengdu J-10 in the air by firing a missile at an airplane, the target plane then exploded. This footage lasted half a second and the destroyed airplane shown was later identified as that of an F-5E, US fighter jet. It turns out the clip was taken from the 1986 US movie \"Top Gun\".\n\nIn 2011, new CCTV head Zhanfan \"was found to have proclaimed in July [or January, both before the CCTV appointment in November] that journalists’ foremost responsibility is to 'be a good mouthpiece'\" (当好喉舌工具). Internet posts of the comment blossomed after the appointment, one \"juxtapos[ing] CCTV’s ... \"Xinwen Lianbo\" (新闻联播) and photos of Chinese crowds waving red flags with black-and-white images from Nazi-era Germany\". Comparisons with the Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels (gepei’er (戈培尔)) also spread. Official media coverage of the Zhanfan's presentation focused on his call to avoid \"fake news and false reports (失实报道)\" but also incorporated the \"mouthpiece\" comment.\n\nDuring the U.S.-led coalition's military intervention in Libya in 2011, reports from CCTV tended to support Gaddafi's arguments, claiming that the coalition forces attacked Libya civilians and the military intervention was no different from an invasion. In some of the news reports, CCTV used pictures of protesters demonstration and said that these people were against the coalition's military intervention. CCTV also mislabeled a person holding a banner which said \"Vive la France\" (\"long live France\" in French) and claimed that he was a supporter of Gaddafi. Later on 27 March, a Chinese banner that said \"Muammar Gaddafi is a lier. \" was shown up in some Libyan demonstration videos from Internet.\n\nIn mid-2011 on CCTV, reporter Li Wenxue asserted that Da Vinci Furniture of Shanghai was falsely labeling Chinese-made furniture as imported from Italy. At the end of the year, \"Shanghai's industry and commerce bureau fined Da Vinci more than $200,000 last week for what it called substandard furniture\", though in August, \"the Shanghai Administration of Industry and Commerce ... cleared Da Vinci of any wrongdoing on its Italian product labeling\". Also, Da Vinci produced a tape and bank records to back its assertion that it had paid 1 million yuan ($150,000), via a public relations broker, to Li to stop any further negative reports by CCTV. Li said the claim is \"slander\" and CCTV made no comment. Zhang Zhi'an, an associate journalism professor at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou said, \"I think CCTV has too much power\", contrasting the Da Vinci case with extortion attempts by journalists at smaller media outlets. Liam Bussell, Asia-Pacific strategic marketing manager for Mintel in Shanghai, said in part, \"Da Vinci's definitely done something\". Also, \"[g]iven the corruption in Chinese media and the volume of counterfeit products in the country, Bussell sa[id] it's often hard to find someone in these disputes who's totally clean\".\n\nIn 2019 CCTV announced that they were cancelling the broadcast of two NBA preseason games in response to a tweet by the General Manager of the Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. After Adam Silver defended the General Manager’s right to free speech CCTV responded with \"We express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Silver's stated support of Morey's right to free speech. We believe any remarks that challenge national sovereignty and social stability do not belong to the category of free speech,” and continued \"We will also immediately examine all other cooperation and exchanges with the NBA.\"\n\nOn 9 February 2009, the Beijing Television Cultural Center caught fire on the last day of the festivities of Chinese New Year, killing one firefighter. The blaze rendered the 42-story structure unusable, as the zinc and titanium alloy of the outer skin was burnt. The Mandarin Oriental Hotel was destroyed before its expected 2009 opening.\n\nThe fire had implications for the credibility of CCTV, which was already unpopular because of its dominance in the media. The incident was mocked by netizens who reproduced photoshopped photos of the fire and criticised CCTV for censoring coverage. Pictures of the fire are widely distributed on the internet, as a result of citizen journalism.\n\nOn 25 February 2013, all of the CCTV channels were replaced by New CCTV channels whose repairs were completed by the end of 2012.\n\n"}
{"id": "62028", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=62028", "title": "CNN", "text": "CNN\n\nCNN (Cable News Network) is an American news-based pay television channel owned by AT&T's WarnerMedia. CNN was founded in 1980 by American media proprietor Ted Turner as a 24-hour cable news channel. Upon its launch in 1980, CNN was the first television channel to provide 24-hour news coverage and was the first all-news television channel in the United States.\n\nWhile the news channel has numerous affiliates, CNN primarily broadcasts from 30 Hudson Yards in New York City, and studios in Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. Its headquarters at the CNN Center in Atlanta is only used for weekend programming. CNN is sometimes referred to as CNN/U.S. (or CNN Domestic) to distinguish the U.S. channel from its international sister network, CNN International.\n\nThe network is known for its dramatic live coverage of breaking news, some of which has drawn criticism as overly sensationalistic, and for its efforts to be nonpartisan, which have led to accusations of false balance.\n\nAs of September 2018, CNN has 90.1 million television households as subscribers (97.7% of households with cable) in the United States. In 2019, CNN ranked third in viewership among cable news networks, behind rivals Fox News and MSNBC, averaging 972,000 viewers. CNN ranks 14th among all basic cable networks.\n\nGlobally, CNN programming airs through CNN International, which can be seen by viewers in over 212 countries and territories.\n\nThe Cable News Network was launched at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of David Walker and Lois Hart anchored the channel's first newscast. Burt Reinhardt, the executive vice president of CNN at its launch, hired most of the channel's first 200 employees, including the network's first news anchor, Bernard Shaw.\n\nSince its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television providers, several websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as CNN Airport). The company has 42 bureaus (11 domestic, 31 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations (which also receive news and features content via the video newswire service CNN Newsource), and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for conglomerate Time Warner's eventual acquisition of the Turner Broadcasting System in 1996.\n\nA companion channel, CNN2, was launched on January 1, 1982 and featured a continuous 24-hour cycle of 30-minute news broadcasts. The channel, which later became known as CNN Headline News and is now known as simply HLN, eventually focused on live news coverage supplemented by personality-based programs during the evening and primetime hours.\n\nThe first Persian Gulf War in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the \"Big Three\" American networks for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside Iraq during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad by reporters Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett.\n\nThe moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Shaw on January 16, 1991, as follows:\n\nUnable to immediately broadcast live pictures from Baghdad, CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War had the dramatic feel of a radio broadcast – and was compared to legendary CBS news anchor Edward R. Murrow's gripping live radio reports of the German bombing of London during World War II. Despite the lack of live pictures, CNN's coverage was carried by television stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide.\n\nThe Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy and made household names of previously obscure reporters. Shaw, known for his live-from-Bagdhad reporting during the Gulf War, became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001. Others include then–Pentagon correspondent Wolf Blitzer (now host of \"The Situation Room\") and international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Amanpour's presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress Nora Dunn as ruthless reporter Adriana Cruz in the 1999 film \"Three Kings\". Time Warner–owned sister network HBO later produced a television movie, \"Live from Baghdad\", about CNN's coverage of the first Gulf War.\n\nCoverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s (particularly the infamous Battle of Mogadishu) led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term \"the CNN effect\" to describe the perceived impact of real time, 24-hour news coverage on the decision-making processes of the American government.\n\nCNN was the first cable news channel to break the news of the September 11 attacks. Anchor Carol Lin was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event. She broke into a commercial at 8:49 a.m. Eastern Time that morning and said:\n\nSean Murtagh, CNN vice president of finance and administration, was the first network employee on the air. He called into CNN Center from his office at CNN's New York City bureau and reported that a commercial jet had hit the Trade Center.\n\nDaryn Kagan and Leon Harris were live on the air just after 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time as the second plane hit the North Tower of the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent David Ensor, reported the news that U.S. officials determined \"that this is a terrorist act.\" Later, Aaron Brown and Judy Woodruff anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded, winning an Edward R. Murrow award for the network. Brown had just joined CNN from ABC to serve as the breaking news anchor. CNN has made archival files of much of the day's broadcast available in five segments, plus an overview.\n\nLeading up to the 2008 U.S. presidential election, CNN devoted large amounts of its coverage to politics, including hosting candidate debates during the Democratic and Republican primary seasons. On June 3 and 5, 2007, CNN teamed up with Saint Anselm College to sponsor the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic Debates. Later that year, the channel hosted the first CNN/YouTube presidential debates, a non-traditional format where viewers were invited to pre-submit questions over the internet via the YouTube video-sharing service. In 2008, CNN partnered with the \"Los Angeles Times\" to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of Super Tuesday. CNN's debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year, with January 2008 viewership averaging 1.1 million viewers, a 41% increase over the previous year.\n\nDriven by live coverage of the year's U.S. presidential election, 2016 was CNN's most-watched year in its history. Throughout the campaign, the network aired unedited coverage of many of the Trump campaign rallies. Aides for Republican candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Ted Cruz accused CNN President Jeff Zucker of undermining their candidates during the Republican primaries. After the election, Zucker acknowledged that it was a mistake to air so many of the campaign rallies. CNN also drew criticism during the election for hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, who was still being paid by and was effectively working on behalf of the campaign.\n\nThe presidency of Donald Trump has led to many prominent controversies involving CNN. The network was accused by critics of giving disproportionate amounts of coverage to Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. CNN president Jeff Zucker defended CNN against the criticism, commenting that out of the Republican candidates, Trump was the most willing to give on-air interviews. Trump commented upon the allegations during his speech at the 2017 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), jokingly referring to CNN as the \"Clinton News Network\".\nIn January 2017, CNN reported that Trump had been briefed on a classified dossier which detailed compromising personal and financial information allegedly obtained by the Russian government. While CNN did not publish the dossier, Trump criticized the network during a press conference the following day, and refused to take a question from CNN reporter Jim Acosta, claiming that the network was \"fake news\". On June 26, 2017, CNN investigative journalists Thomas Frank, Eric Lichtblau, and Lex Haris voluntarily resigned after the network retracted an online article which incorrectly connected Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci to a $10 billion Russian investment fund. The network apologized to Scaramucci and admitted that the online story did not meet their editorial standards. Zucker responded by stressing that the network needs to \"play error-free ball\" when it comes to any future stories about Trump.\n\nIn July 2017, Trump posted a video on Twitter of himself tackling Vince McMahon on the ground during WrestleMania 23, edited to replace McMahon's face with the CNN logo. The clip was considered to be a further expression of his opinions regarding the network's quality of coverage. Several media columnists and Democratic politicians condemned the retweeted video, concerned that its substance—given the tone of some of Trump's criticism of mainstream media outlets for what he deems as unfavorable coverage of him and his presidency—could encourage some of his extreme right-wing supporters to commit violence against journalists from outlets outside of the conservative media spectrum. CNN also faced criticism over an investigation that identified the Reddit user (associated with a Trump-focused community on the service, r/The_Donald) who had allegedly created the video, facing accusations that they had blackmailed the user.\n\nLater that month, a group of Democratic senators, led by Amy Klobuchar, issued a request for information over allegations that the Trump administration was planning to use CNN as \"leverage for political gain\" in the process of clearing the proposed acquisition of its parent company Time Warner by AT&T—a purchase which was first announced in October 2016. \"The Daily Caller\" reported that, in particular, the administration was seeking the removal of Jeff Zucker as CNN president. Although Trump had promised to block the acquisition entirely during his presidential campaign, Trump's transition team later stated that the government planned to evaluate the deal without prejudice.\n\nFollowing the announcement of the acquisition, AT&T CEO Randall L. Stephenson stated that the company was \"committed to continuing the editorial independence of CNN\". In August 2017, \"Deadline Hollywood\" reported that AT&T had considered spinning off CNN and its stake in TMZ post-acquisition. In October 2017, Stephenson downplayed the possibility that the ongoing tensions between Trump and CNN could affect the deal, stating that he \"[didn't] know what the relevance of CNN is in terms of an antitrust review\", and that AT&T did not plan to make managerial changes to Time Warner properties that were operating well, such as CNN. Later that month, CNN launched a new promotional campaign, \"Facts First\", in an effort to combat negative perceptions over the quality of its reporting. Using an apple to demonstrate metaphors for fake news and \"alternative facts\" (in particular, suggesting that one could persistently opine that the apple was actually a banana), the ads publicize a commitment to prioritizing accurate, fact-based reporting before presenting opinions on a particular story. The ad became the subject of parodies, including one by \"The Daily Caller\" (which reversed the ad, and amended the slogan with \"unless we are reporting on Trump\"), and Stephen Colbert (which closed with the line \"Now orange you ready to impeach?\"), and was criticized by conservative publishers, Republican politicians, and on social media.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, Stephenson met with Makan Delrahim, assistant Attorney General of the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division, to discuss antitrust and concentration of media ownership concerns surrounding the acquisition, and possible options for satisfying them. Two days later, major media outlets publicly reported that the Justice Department had recommended that either the entire Turner Broadcasting System unit, or DirecTV, be divested as a condition of the merger. The \"Financial Times\" went further, stating that it had specifically demanded the divestment of CNN. Stephenson denied these reports, stating that he never offered to, nor had any intentions to sell CNN. CNN's media correspondent Brian Stelter noted that media outlets were interpreting the alleged recommendations as being either a genuine concern for AT&T's scale following the merger, or a retaliatory measure by the Trump administration against CNN.\n\nAt the \"DealBook\" conference in New York City the next day, Stephenson denied that the Department had demanded the divestment of CNN at all (stating that he had \"never been told that the price of getting the deal done was selling CNN\"), and that the company aimed to \"get to a negotiated settlement\". However, he stated that if they were unable to do so, AT&T was \"prepared to litigate\". In a statement to CNBC, a Department of Justice official backed Stephenson, denying that there were any specific demands to divest CNN during the discussion, and considering the claims to be \"shocking\" and an attempt to politicize the situation. The official added that the Department had officially recommended either abandoning the deal entirely, or divesting DirecTV or Turner, but that it was open to other options for quelling antitrust concerns. The same day, the watchdog group Protect Democracy sued the Department of Justice to seek information on whether the Trump administration had \"improperly interfered with the Department's review of the merger between AT&T and Time Warner, or has acted in that matter based on the President's personal dislike of CNN's protected speech.\" The group had issued a Freedom of Information Act request for these details, but the Department had not responded. On November 20, 2017, the Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit over the acquisition.\n\nAfter District of Columbia U.S. District Court judge Richard J. Leon ruled in favor of AT&T in the lawsuit, AT&T completed its acquisition of Time Warner on June 14, 2018, and renamed the company WarnerMedia.\n\nIn March 2019, WarnerMedia announced a restructuring that effectively dissolved Turner Broadcasting, placing CNN, Turner Sports and the AT&T SportsNet regional sports networks to a new \"WarnerMedia News & Sports\" division, with Jeff Zucker becoming head of the combined operation.\n\nOn May 6, 2019, CNN began to broadcast programming from its new studios at 30 Hudson Yards, which succeeded the Time Warner Center as WarnerMedia's New York headquarters. In late May 2019, CNN International announced it was reducing its programming and staff based in London to reduce costs, citing losses of $10 million per-year.\n\nIn October 2016, WikiLeaks published emails from John Podesta which showed CNN contributor Donna Brazile passing the questions for a CNN-sponsored debate to the Clinton campaign. In the email, Brazile discussed her concern of Clinton's ability to field a question regarding the death penalty. The following day Clinton would receive the question about the death penalty, verbatim from an audience member at the CNN-hosted Town Hall event. According to a CNNMoney investigation, the debate moderator Roland Martin of TV One \"did not deny sharing information with Brazile.\" CNN severed ties with Brazile three days later, on October 14, 2016.\n\nCNN's current weekday schedule consists mostly of rolling news programming during daytime hours, followed by in-depth news and information programs during the evening and prime time hours. The network's morning programming consists of \"Early Start\", an early-morning news program hosted by Christine Romans and Dave Briggs at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by \"New Day\", the network's morning show, hosted by Alisyn Camerota and John Berman at 6–9 a.m. ET. Most of CNN's late-morning and early afternoon programming consists of \"CNN Newsroom\", a rolling news program hosted by Jim Sciutto and Poppy Harlow in the morning and Brooke Baldwin in the afternoon. In between the editions of \"Newsroom\", \"At This Hour\" with Kate Bolduan airs at 11 a.m. to noon Eastern, followed by \"Inside Politics with John King\", hosted by John King at noon Eastern, and \"CNN Right Now\" with Brianna Keilar at 1 p.m. Eastern.\n\nCNN's late afternoon and early evening lineup consists of \"The Lead with Jake Tapper\", hosted by Jake Tapper at 4 p.m. Eastern and \"The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\", hosted by Wolf Blitzer at 5–7 p.m. ET. The network's evening and primetime lineup shifts towards more in-depth programming, including \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" at 7 p.m. ET, and \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" at 8 p.m. ET, followed by \"Cuomo Prime Time\" with Chris Cuomo at 9 p.m., and \"CNN Tonight\" hosted by Don Lemon at 10 p.m. Eastern. Overnight programming consists of reruns of the primetime lineup, and an overnight simulcast of the CNN International version of \"CNN Newsroom\" from Atlanta, GA.\n\nWeekend primetime is dedicated mostly to factual programming, such as documentary specials and miniseries, and documentary-style reality series (such as \"\" and \"United Shades of America\"), as well as acquired documentary films presented under the banner \"CNN Films\". The network's weekend morning programming consists of \"CNN Newsroom\" (simulcast from CNN International) at 4–6 a.m. ET, which is followed by the weekend editions of \"New Day\", hosted by Christi Paul and Victor Blackwell, which airs every Saturday at 6–9 a.m. ET and Sunday at 6–8 a.m. ET and the network's Saturday program \"Smerconish\" with Michael Smerconish at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at 6 p.m. Eastern. Sunday morning lineup consists primarily of political talk shows, including \"Inside Politics with John King\", hosted by John King at 8 a.m. Eastern and \"State of the Union\", hosted by Jake Tapper at 9 a.m. Eastern and replay at noon Eastern, and the international affairs program \"Fareed Zakaria GPS\", hosted by Fareed Zakaria at 10 a.m. Eastern and replay at 1 p.m. Eastern, and the media analysis program \"Reliable Sources\", hosted by Brian Stelter at 11 a.m. Eastern.\n\nFor the 2014–15 season, after cancelling \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" (which, itself, replaced the long-running \"Larry King Live\"), CNN experimented with running factual and reality-style programming during the 9:00 p.m. ET hour, such as John Walsh's \"The Hunt\", \"This Is Life with Lisa Ling\", and Mike Rowe's \"Somebody's Gotta Do It\". Jeff Zucker explained that this new lineup was intended to shift CNN away from a reliance on pundit-oriented programs, and attract younger demographics to the network. Zucker stated that the 9:00 p.m. hour could be pre-empted during major news events for expanded coverage. These changes coincided with the introduction of a new imaging campaign for the network, featuring the slogan \"Go there\". In May 2014, CNN premiered \"The Sixties\", a documentary miniseries produced by Tom Hanks and Gary Goetzman which chronicled the United States in the 1960s. Owing to its success, CNN commissioned follow-ups focusing on other decades. \"Anderson Cooper 360°\" was expanded to run two hours long, from 8 PM to 10 PM.\n\nBy 2019, CNN had produced at least 35 original series. Alongside the Hanks/Goetzman franchise (including the 2018 spin-off \"1968\"), CNN has aired other documentary miniseries relating to news and U.S. policies, such as \"The Bush Years\", and \"American Dynasties: The Kennedys\"—which saw the highest ratings of any CNN original series premiere to-date, with 1.7 million viewers. \"Parts Unknown\" concluded after the 2018 suicide death of its host Anthony Bourdain; CNN announced several new miniseries and docuseries for 2019, including \"American Style\" (a miniseries produced by the digital media company Vox Media), \"The Redemption Project with Van Jones\", \"Chasing Life with Sanjay Gupta\", \"Tricky Dick\" (a miniseries chronicling Richard Nixon), \"The Movies\" (a spin-off of the Hanks/Goetzman decades miniseries), and \"Once in a Great City: Detroit 1962-64\".\n\nCNN began broadcasting in the high definition 1080i resolution format in September 2007. This format is now standard for CNN and is available on all major cable and satellite providers.\n\nCNN's political coverage in HD was first given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.\n\nIn December 2008, CNN introduced a comprehensive redesign of its on-air appearance, which replaced an existing style that had been used since 2004. On-air graphics took a rounded, flat look in a predominantly black, white, and red color scheme, and the introduction of a new box next to the CNN logo for displaying show logos and segment-specific graphics, rather than as a large banner above the lower-third. The redesign also replaced the scrolling ticker with a static \"flipper\", which could either display a feed of news headlines (both manually inserted and taken from the RSS feeds of CNN.com), or \"topical\" details related to a story.\n\nCNN's next major redesign was introduced on January 10, 2011, replacing the dark, flat appearance of the 2008 look with a glossier, blue and white color scheme, and moving the secondary logo box to the opposite end of the screen. Additionally, the network began to solely produce its programming in the aspect ratio, with standard definition feeds using a letterboxed version of the HD feed. On February 18, 2013, the \"flipper\" was dropped and reverted to a scrolling ticker; originally displayed as a blue background with white text, the ticker was reconfigured a day later with blue text on a white background to match the look of the 'flipper'.\n\nOn August 11, 2014, CNN introduced its most recent graphics package, dropping the glossy appearance for a flat, rectangular scheme incorporating red, white, and black colors, and the Gotham typeface. The ticker now alternates between general headlines and financial news from CNNMoney, and the secondary logo box was replaced with a smaller box below the CNN bug, which displays either the title, hashtag, or Twitter handle for the show being aired or its anchor. In April 2016, CNN began to introduce a new corporate typeface, known as \"CNN Sans\", across all of its platforms. Inspired by Helvetica Neue and commissioned after consultations with Troika Design Group, the font family consists of 30 different versions with varying weights and widths to facilitate use across print, television, and digital mediums.\n\nIn August 2016, CNN announced the launch of its new initiative, CNN Aerial Imagery and Reporting (CNN AIR). It is a drone-based news collecting operation to integrate aerial imagery and reporting across all CNN branches and platforms, along with Turner Broadcasting and Time Warner entities.\n\nOn July 27, 2012, CNN president Jim Walton announced he was resigning after 30 years at the network. Walton remained with CNN until the end of that year. In January 2013, former NBCUniversal President Jeff Zucker replaced Walton.\n\nOn January 29, 2013, longtime political analysts James Carville and Mary Matalin, and fellow political contributor Erick Erickson were let go by CNN.\n\nCNN launched its website, CNN.com (initially known as \"CNN Interactive\"), on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of blogs, social media and user-generated content have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of CNN Pipeline in late 2005.\n\nIn April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S., according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.\n\nCNN Pipeline was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or \"pipes\"), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up \"news alerts\" to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running Microsoft Windows. There was also a browser-based \"web client\" that did not require installation. The service was discontinued in July 2007, and was replaced with a free streaming service.\n\nThe topical news program \"Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics\" was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005. Blog coverage was expanded when \"Inside Politics\" was folded into \"The Situation Room\" (\"Inside Politics\" later returned to CNN in 2014, this time hosted by the network's chief national correspondent John King.). In 2006, CNN launched CNN Exchange and CNN iReport, initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from blogging to citizen journalism within the CNN brand. CNN iReport which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech shootings sent-in first hand photos of what was going on during the shootings.\n\nIn early 2008, CNN began maintaining a live streaming broadcast available to cable and satellite subscribers who receive CNN at home (a precursor to the TV Everywhere services that would become popularized by cable and satellite providers beginning with Time Warner's incorporation of the medium). CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the RealNetworks SuperPass subscription service outside the U.S. CNN also offers several RSS feeds and podcasts.\n\nOn April 18, 2008, CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the 2008 Tibetan unrest. CNN reported that they took preventative measures after news broke of the impending attack.\n\nThe company was honored at the 2008 Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system. The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver covered, and was detained, for the release of the U.S. Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the Hainan Island incident. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK. This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material worldwide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various prosumer and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and BGAN terminals from Hughes Network Systems.\n\nOn October 24, 2009, CNN launched a new version of the CNN.com website; the revamped site included the addition of a new \"sign up\" option, in which users can create their own username and profile, and a new \"CNN Pulse\" (beta) feature, along with a new red color theme. However, most of the news stories archived on the website were deleted.\n\n, there are four versions of the website: the American version, the International version, the Spanish version, and the Arabic version. Readers can choose their preferred version, but in the absence of a selection, the server determines an edition according to the requesting IP address.\n\nCNN also has a channel in the popular video-sharing site YouTube, but its videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide. In 2014, CNN launched a radio version of their popular Television programming on TuneIn Radio.\n\nIn April 2010, CNN announced via Twitter that it would launch a food blog called \"Eatocracy,\" which will \"cover all news related to food – from recalls to health issues to culture.\" CNN had an internet relay chat (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with Benjamin Netanyahu on the network in 1998.\n\nCNNHealth consists of expert doctors answering viewers' questions online at CNN's \"The Chart\" blog website. Contributors include Drs. Sanjay Gupta (Chief Medical Correspondent), Charles Raison (Mental Health Expert), Otis Brawley (Conditions Expert), Melina Jampolis (Diet and Fitness Expert), Jennifer Shu (Living Well Expert), and Elizabeth Cohen (Senior Medical Correspondent).\n\nOn March 7, 2017, CNN announced the official launch of its virtual reality unit named CNNVR. It will produce 360 videos to its Android and iOS apps within CNN Digital. It is planning to cover major news events with the online, and digital news team in New York City, Atlanta, London, Hong Kong, San Francisco, Dubai, Johannesburg, Tokyo, and Beijing.\n\nCNN also maintains a wire service known as CNN Wire.\n\nCNN Newsource is a subscription-based affiliation video service that provides CNN content to television station affiliates with CNN, including terrestrial stations and international stations. Newsource allows affiliates to download video from CNN, as well as from other affiliates who upload their video to Newsource.\n\nOn November 28, 2016, CNN announced the acquisition of Beme for a reported $25 million. On November 29, 2016, Matt Hackett, co-founder of Beme, announced via an email to its users that the Beme app would be shutting down on January 31, 2017. Since the shutdown of the app, it was announced that CNN intended to use the current talent behind Beme to work on a separate start-up endeavor. Beme's current team will retain full creative control of the new project, which was slated to release in summer 2017. Beme have also brought on other internet stars such as the host of Vsauce 3, Jake Roper, as head of production, who features prominently in Beme co-founder Casey Neistat's vlogs. Beme News has since begun uploading news related video on YouTube\n\nIn October 2012, CNN formed a film division called CNN Films to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled \"Girl Rising\", a documentary narrated by Meryl Streep that focused on the struggles of girls' education.\n\nIn July 2014, Cumulus Media announced that it would end its partnership with ABC News Radio, and enter into a new partnership with CNN to syndicate national and international news content for its stations through Westwood One beginning in 2015, including access to a wire service, and digital content for its station websites. This service is unbranded, allowing individual stations to integrate the content with their own news brands.\n\nAs of February 2019, the audio simulcast of CNN is distributed on Entercom's Radio.com website and app.\n\nOver the years, CNN has launched spin-off networks in the United States and other countries. Channels that currently operate include:\n\nA Brazilian channel, called CNN Brazil, is expected to start operating in the first half of 2020.\n\nCNN has also launched television and online ventures that are no longer in operation, including:\n\nCNN launched two specialty news channels for the American market which would later close amid competitive pressure: the sports news channel CNNSI shut down in 2002, while business news channel CNNfn shut down after nine years on the air in December 2004. CNN had a partnership with \"Sports Illustrated\" through the sports website CNNSI.com, but sold the domain name in May 2015. CNNfn's former website used to redirect to money.cnn.com, a product of CNN's strategic partnership with \"Money\" magazine. \"Money\" and \"Sports Illustrated\" were both Time Warner properties until 2014, when the company's magazine division was spun off into the separate Time Inc.\n\nCNN operates bureaus in the following cities . \n\nUnited States\n\n\nCNN has regional headquarters in Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong, and London. Other bureau locations include:\nIn parts of the world without a CNN bureau, reports from local affiliate station the network will be used to file a story.\n\n2018: CNN won a network-record six news & documentary Emmy Awards. They are, Outstanding Breaking News Coverage, Outstanding Continuing Coverage of a News Story in a Newscast, Outstanding Live Interview, Outstanding Hard News Feature Story in a Newscast, Outstanding News Special, Outstanding Science, Medical and Environmental Report.\n\n2018: CNN's Nima Elbagir to receive 2018 Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation.\n\n2018: CNN received the George Polk Award for Foreign Television Reporting for uncovering a hidden modern-day slave auction of African refugees in Libya.

{"id": "420162", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=420162", "title": "RAI", "text": "RAI\n\nRAI – Radiotelevisione italiana (; commercially styled as Rai since 2000; known until 1954 as ) is the national public broadcasting company of Italy, owned by the Ministry of Economy and Finance.\n\nRAI operates many terrestrial and subscription television channels and radio stations. It is one of the biggest television broadcaster in Italy and competes with Mediaset, and other minor television and radio networks. RAI has a relatively high television audience share of 35.9%.\n\nRAI broadcasts are also received in neighbouring countries, including Albania, Bosnia, Croatia, Malta, Monaco, Montenegro, San Marino, Slovenia, Vatican City, Switzerland, and Tunisia, and elsewhere on pay television. Half of the RAI's revenues come from broadcast receiving licence fees, the rest from the sale of advertising time. In 1950, the RAI became one of the 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union.\n\nThe Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI) was formed in 1924 with the backing of the Marconi Company following a model adopted in other European countries. URI made its inaugural broadcast — a speech by Benito Mussolini at Teatro Costanzi — on 5 October. Regular programming began the following evening, with a quartet performing Haydn's Quartet No. 7 in A major from the Palazzo Corradi. At 21.00 CET, Ines Donarelli Viviani announced for the first time: \"\"URI—Unione Radiofonica Italiana\" Rome station 1RO 425 meters wavelength. To all those who are listening our greetings, good evening\". Guglielmo Marconi's \"S.A. Radiofono—Società Italiana per le Radiocomunicazioni Circolari\" (Radiofono) held 85% of URI shares and Western Electric's \"Società Italiana Radio Audizioni Circolari\" (SIRAC) held the remaining 15%.\n\nUnder the provisions of Royal Decree No. 1067 of 8 February 1923, wireless broadcasting became a state monopoly under the control of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs; URI was commissioned to provide services for a minimum of six years pursuant to Royal Decree No. 2191 of 14 October 1924 \"Concessione dei servizi radioauditivi circolari alla Società Anonima Unione Radiofonica Italiana\". However, when URI's contract expired in 1927, it was succeeded under Royal Decree Law No. 2207 of 17 November 1927 by the partially nationalised Ente Italiano per le Audizioni Radiofoniche (EIAR), which became \"Radio Audizioni Italiane S.p.A.\" (RAI) with investment from \"Società Idroelettrica Piemontese\" (SIP) in 1944.\n\nDuring the reconstruction following World War II, much of RAI's early programming was influenced by the \"Reithian\" style of the BBC. The emphasis was on educational content. Programs like \"Non è mai troppo tardi\" and \"Un viaggio al Po\" introduced people to what life was like in other parts of the country, at a time when most people could not afford to travel.\n\nOver the following years the RAI made various changes to its services. It reorganized its radio stations in November 1946 into two national networks, \"Rete Rossa\" and \"Rete Azzurra\" (\"Red Network\" and \"Blue Network\"). It added the culture-based \"Terzo Programma\" in October 1950. On 1 January 1952 the \"Rete Rossa\" became the \"Programma Nazionale\" (focusing on informational content) and the \"Rete Azzurra\" became the \"Secondo Programma\" (with a greater emphasis on entertainment). The three radio channels eventually became today's Rai Radio 1, Rai Radio 2, and Rai Radio 3.\n\nIn 1954 the state-owned holding company Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) became the sole shareholder and IRI – now renamed \"RAI—Radiotelevisione italiana\" to reflect its extended responsibilities – finally began a regular television service. On 3 January at 11.00 CET, the first RAI television announcer presented the day's schedule, which was broadcast from the service's Milan headquarters and relay stations in Turin and Rome. At 14.30, the first regular programme in Italian television history was broadcast: \"Arrivi e partenze\", hosted by Armando Pizzo and Mike Bongiorno. The evening's entertainment was a theatre performance, \"L'osteria della posta\", written by Carlo Goldoni. 23.15 saw the start of the day's concluding programme, \"La Domenica Sportiva\" – the first edition of a weekly series which continues to this day.\n\nRAI was originally the subsidiary of RAI Holding S.p.A. RAI Holding was absorbed into RAI\nas of 1 December 2004, per Article 21 of Law 112/04.\n\nThe RAI is governed by a nine-member Administrative Council. Seven of members are elected by a committee of the Italian Parliament. The other two (one of which is the President) are nominated by the largest shareholder: the Ministry of Economic Development. The Council appoints the Director-General. The Director-General and the members of the Administrative Council are appointed for a renewable three-year term.\nIn 2005, the government of Silvio Berlusconi proposed partial privatization of RAI by \nselling 20% ownership. This proposal was very controversial, in part because Berlusconi was the head of the leading private broadcaster Mediaset. Some critics claimed that Mediaset could become the buyer and thus increase its dominant position. However, after the revelation that RAI would lose €80m ($96m, £54m) in 2006, the privatization plan was suspended in October 2005.\n\nOn 18 May 2010, Raisat received a major upgrade and re-branded with a new logo and a new name. It and all of the sister channels dropped the \"sat\" part from the name and became Rai YoYo, Rai 5 (formerly known as Rai Extra), Rai Premium, and Rai Movie (formerly known as Raisat Cinema).\n\nOn 11 June 2013, the RAI was one of the few known European broadcasters to condemn and criticize the closure of Greece's state broadcaster ERT.\n\nRAI company has been criticized because as of 2015 it had 46 directors and 262 head offices and they are considered too many; RAI Spa is a private company but it is 100% owned by the Italian Government and all the TV owners in Italy have to pay an annual tax of 100 euros.\n\nRAI Spa company is 99% owned by the Italian Government Ministry of Economy and Finance, so it is said that it broadcasts content that may politically influence people.\n\n\nFM, AM, Satellite, DAB/DAB+, DTT, Filodiffusion, Web:\n\n\n\n\nRai Libri is the print publishing arm of Rai, headquartered in Turin. They primarily publish magazines and periodicals for news, entertainment, the broadcast industry, and since their beginning, broadcast schedules. They also have published since 1969 the \"\", the largest Italian dictionary of its kind.\n\nRAI's history in print with the Unione Radiofonica Italiana (URI)'s weekly magazine \"Radio Orario\" which debuted in January 1925 and became \"Radiocorriere\" in 1930. Edizioni Radio Italiana (ERI) was founded in 1949 in Turin, formed entirely from RAI capital to build on \"Radiocorriere\"'s success. In 1954 primary ownership was split between RAI and Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI). That same year \"Radiocorriere\" became \"Radiocorriere TV\", which would continue to be published until RAI divested in 1995.\n\nDuring the 50s and 60s the ERI published \"Classe Unica\", ' and ', and in 1969 the first edition of the \"DOP\". The 80s saw the premiere of the monthlies \"Moda\" (1983) and \"King\" (1987), along with registering a new company name in 1987: Nuova Eri Edizioni Rai-Radiotelevisione Italiana S.p.A., or \"Nuova ERI\".\n\nSince the 90s RAI/ERI has increasingly focused on publishing books written by its own broadcast stars, both in news and entertainment. In 1995 Nuova ERI closed and reopened in 1996 as \"Rai Eri\". On 15 October 2018 they renamed to \"Rai Libri\".\n\nRai Libri also edits technical publications: \"Elettronica e telecomunicazioni\" since 1946, \"Nuova rivista musicale italiana\" since 1967, and \"Nuova civiltà delle macchine\" since 1957. It produces its own reports on communications and media, with the second edition of the book-and-documentary \"RicordeRai\" released in 2004 in collaboration with Rai Teche.\n\nRAI (originally URI) had printed its broadcast schedules nearly without interruption starting in 1925 as \"Radio Orario\", then from 1930 as \"Radiocorriere\", then continuously from 1954 as \"Radiocorriere TV\", until RAI divested in 1995.\n\nThe magazine was restarted under publisher with a print edition from 1999–2008, closing due to poor sales. It reopened in 2012 as an online-only publication, with a handful of special-occasion independent print runs in the intervening years, including 2005 (its 80th anniversary), 2010 (switchover to DTTV), and 2011 (150th Anniversary of the Unification of Italy). The \"Rai Ufficio Stampa [press office]\" website has meanwhile published programming schedules and television blurbs online since 2011 under the magazine's name. On 3 January 2014 Rai Teche published online the complete 1925–1995 archives of URI/RAI's \"Radio Orario\"/\"Radiocorriere\"/\"TV\".\n\n\nThere are RAI offices in foreign countries, which produce news reports that are broadcast live in Italy. These offices are in: Brussels, Paris, Berlin, London, New York City, Beijing, Cairo, Jerusalem, Nairobi, Moscow, Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAs March 2015, the RAI has a debt of 442 million and the Italian Court of Audit was worried about the size of RAI's debt for the impact that this may have on Italian people, as the company is owned by the state.\n\nItalians must purchase an annual television license for about €90 every year in order to legally own a TV or HDTV. It is known as \"Canone Rai\", \"Rai Tax\" because it is used to part-fund the RAI. Since 2016, it is financed through the electricity bill.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "58089", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=58089", "title": "ITV (TV network)", "text": "ITV (TV network)\n\nITV is a British free-to-air television network with its headquarters in London. It was launched in 1955 as Independent Television, under the auspices of the Independent Television Authority (ITA) (later the Independent Broadcasting Authority, after the Sound Broadcasting Act 1972, and currently Ofcom), to provide competition to BBC Television which had been established in 1932. ITV is the oldest commercial network in the UK. Since the passing of the Broadcasting Act 1990, its legal name has been Channel 3, to distinguish it from the other analogue channels at the time, namely BBC 1, BBC 2 and Channel 4. In part, the number 3 was assigned because television sets would usually be tuned so that the regional ITV station would be on the third button, with the other stations being allocated to the number within their name.\n\nITV is a network of television companies that operate regional television services and also share programmes between each other to be shown on the entire network. In recent years, several of these companies have merged, so currently the fifteen regional franchises are in the hands of two companies.\n\nThe ITV network is to be distinguished from ITV plc, the company that resulted from the merger of Granada plc and Carlton Communications in 2004 and which holds the Channel 3 broadcasting licences in England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland. With the exception of Northern Ireland, the ITV brand is the brand used by ITV plc for the Channel 3 service in these areas. In Northern Ireland, ITV plc uses the brand name UTV. STV Group plc uses the STV brand for its two franchises of central and northern Scotland.\n\nThe origins of ITV lie in the passing of the Television Act 1954, designed to break the monopoly on television held by the BBC Television Service. The act created the Independent Television Authority (ITA, then IBA after the Sound Broadcasting Act) to heavily regulate the industry and to award franchises. The first six franchises were awarded in 1954 for London, the Midlands and the North of England, with separate franchises for Weekdays and Weekends. The first ITV network to launch was London's Associated-Rediffusion on 22 September 1955, with the Midlands and North services launching in February 1956 and May 1956 respectively. Following these launches, the ITA awarded more franchises until the whole country was covered by fourteen regional stations, all launched by 1962.\n\nThe network has been modified several times through franchise reviews that have taken place in 1963, 1967, 1974, 1980 and 1991, during which broadcast regions have changed and service operators have been replaced. Only one service operator has ever been declared bankrupt, WWN in 1963, with all other operators leaving the network as a result of a franchise review. Separate weekend franchises were removed in 1968 (with the exception of London) and over the years more services were added; these included a national breakfast franchise from 1983 onward—operating between 6:00 am and 9:25 am—and a teletext service. The Broadcasting Act 1990 changed the nature of ITV; the then regulator the IBA was replaced with a light-touch regulator, the ITC; companies became able to purchase other ITV regional companies and franchises were now being awarded based upon a highest-bidder auction, with few safeguards in place. This heavily criticised part of the review saw four operators replaced, and the operators facing different annual payments to the Treasury: Central Television, for example, paid only £2000—despite holding a lucrative and large region—because it was unopposed, while Yorkshire Television paid £37.7 million for a region of the same size and status, owing to heavy competition.\n\nFollowing the 1993 changes, ITV as a network began to consolidate with several companies doing so to save money by ceasing the duplication of services present when they were all separate companies. By 2004, ITV was owned by five companies, of which two, Carlton and Granada had become major players by owning between them all the franchises in England, Wales, the Scottish borders and the Isle of Man. That same year, the two merged to form ITV plc with the only subsequent acquisitions being the takeover of Channel Television, the Channel Islands franchise, in 2011. and UTV, the franchise for Northern Ireland, in 2015.\n\nThe ITV network is not owned or operated by one company, but by a number of licensees, which provide regional services while also broadcasting programmes across the network. Since 2016, the fifteen licences are held by two companies, with the majority held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.\n\nThe network is regulated by the media regulator Ofcom who is responsible for awarding the broadcast licences. The last major review of the Channel 3 franchises was in 1991, with all operators' licences having been renewed between 1999 and 2002 and again from 2014 without a further contest. While this has been the longest period that the ITV Network has gone without a major review of its licence holders, Ofcom announced (following consultation) that it would split the Wales and West licence from 1 January 2014, creating a national licence for Wales and joining the newly separated West region to Westcountry Television, to form a new licence for the enlarged South West of England region.\n\nAll companies holding a licence were part of the non-profit body ITV Network Limited, which commissioned and scheduled network programming, with compliance previously handled by ITV plc and Channel Television. However, due to amalgamation of several of these companies since the creation of ITV Network Limited (and given Channel Television is now owned by ITV plc), it has been replaced by an affiliation system. Approved by Ofcom, this results in ITV plc commissioning and funding the network schedule, with STV and UTV paying a fee to broadcast it. All licensees have the right to opt out of network programming (except for the national news bulletins), however many do not due to pressures from the parent company or because of limited resources. Prior to the affiliate system being introduced, STV would frequently (and sometimes controversially) opt out of several popular network programmes – such as the original run of the first series of \"Downton Abbey\" – citing the need to provide more Scottish content to its viewers.\n\nAs a public service broadcaster, the ITV network is obliged to broadcast programming of public importance, including news, current affairs, children's and religious programming as well as party election broadcasts on behalf of the major political parties and political events, such as the Budget. The network also needs to produce accessible output containing subtitles, signing and audio description. In exchange for this programming, the ITV network is available on all platforms free to air and can be found at the top of the EPG of all providers.\n\nSince the launch of the platform in 1998, all of the ITV licensees have received gifted capacity on the digital terrestrial television platform. At present, the companies are able to broadcast additional channels and all choose to broadcast the ITV plc owned ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and CITV in their region. UTV and STV (formerly Scottish Television and Grampian Television) previously broadcast their own services – UTV2 in Northern Ireland and S2 in central and northern Scotland – until 2002, when they adopted the ITV plc channels. The broadcasters all make use of the Digital 3&4 multiplex, shared with Channel 4. ITV Encore launched on June 2014 and ITVBe launched in October 2014. ITV Box Office launched in February 2017.\n\nITV plc owns thirteen of the fifteen franchises and broadcasts to England, Wales, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland through its subsidiary companies ITV Broadcasting Limited, and UTV Limited The company also owns the breakfast contractor that broadcasts across the network between 6:00 and 9:25am each morning using the \"Good Morning Britain\" (previously \"Daybreak\") and \"Lorraine\" names. The company broadcasts a centralised service under the ITV brand. In Northern Ireland, ITV uses the UTV brand name.\n\nThe group also owns ITV Studios, the production arm of the company and formed from an amalgamation of all the production departments of the regional licences they own. The company produces a large proportion of ITV's networked programming (around 47%, but previously as high as 66% according to some reports), with the rest coming primarily from independent suppliers (under the Broadcasting Act 1990, at least 25% of ITV's total output must be from independent companies). ITV plc hopes to increase the amount of in-house programming to as close to the 75% limit as possible.\n\nThe group cut the number of regional news programmes offered from 17 in 2007 to 9 by 2009, resulting several regions being merged to form one programme, including the Border Television and Tyne Tees Television regions, the Westcountry Television and West regions and the removal of sub regional programming, with some regions only represented by pre-recorded segments.\nSTV Group plc owns two franchises, covering central and northern Scotland, through subsidiary companies STV Central and STV North, broadcasting a central service under the STV brand.\n\nThe company has had several disputes with ITV plc in recent years over network programming. STV aims to broadcast more Scottish programmes at peak times and so removed several key ITV plc programmes from their schedule in July 2009 including \"The Bill\", \"Midsomer Murders\" and \"Lewis\". Despite STV's explanation of expense, ITV plc were angered by the decision, as a recent schedule change had made \"The Bill\" central to their programming, and broadcast the programmes on ITV3 as well to ensure Scottish viewers could see the programmes. On 23 September ITV was reported to be in the process of suing STV for £20 million, as ITV plc felt dropping the shows constituted a breach of network agreements; STV subsequently counter-sued ITV plc for £35 million.\n\nThe dispute was ended in 2011 with STV agreeing to pay ITV plc £18 million. The signing of the new affiliation deal has resulted in STV paying a flat fee for all networked programming, and so to drop any programmes is unlikely due to the large costs involved.\n\nThere are fourteen regional licences and one national licence for the breakfast service. Other licences exist to provide specific programming services, such as Teletext and national news, but are not listed here. All licences listed here were renewed until the end of 2024. Licences in England and Wales were held by the individual regional ITV plc owned companies prior to November 2008.\n\nFor over 60 years of ITV, its homegrown programmes have become among the best remembered as well as being extremely successful. Before the 1990s, nearly all of the content for the channel was produced by the fifteen franchise licensees: the regional companies.\n\nHowever, in the last decade, and following legislation in the Broadcasting Act 1990 imposing a 25% quota for commissioning of independent productions, the number of programmes from independent production companies not connected to the traditional ITV Network, has increased rapidly. Notable examples include Talkback Thames (one half of which, Thames Television, was itself a former ITV franchisee), producers of \"The Bill\" and co-producers of \"The X Factor\", and 2waytraffic (previously Celador), producers of \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\".\n\nFrom the late 1990s, ITV's long-standing commitment to strong current affairs and documentary programming began to diminish with the ending of productions such as \"World in Action\" (Granada Television), \"This Week\" (Rediffusion London/Thames Television), \"First Tuesday\" (Yorkshire Television), \"Network First\", \"Survival\" (Anglia Television), and \"Weekend World\" (LWT) and their replacement with populist shows such as \"Tonight\". \"News at Ten\" was also axed in 1999, although it was reinstated in 2001. In December 2009, the final edition of ITV's long-running arts programme, \"The South Bank Show\" was broadcast.\n\nITV's primetime schedules are dominated by its soap operas, such as the flagship \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\". At the start of the 21st century, Independent Television faced criticism for including a large amount of \"reality TV\" programmes in the schedule, such as \"Celebrity Fit Club\", \"Celebrity Wrestling\" and \"Love Island\". In its defence, ITV does continue to show its major strengths in the fields of sports coverage and drama productions, and it continues to schedule national news in primetime.\n\nITV's strong daytime line-up helped by programmes such as \"This Morning\", \"Loose Women\", \"Good Morning Britain\", \"Dickinson's Real Deal\" and game shows \"Tipping Point\" and \"The Chase\" are very popular, achieving the highest audience share during the daytime slot.\n\nSince the network started, Independent Television News Limited (ITN) has held the contract to produce news for the ITV Network, with 30-minute national news bulletins broadcast at 1:30 pm, 6:30 pm, and 10:00 pm. These bulletins were broadcast under the ITN brand between 1955 and 1999, when a new network identity reinforced the ITV brand, resulting in the new bulletins being broadcast under the ITV News brand.\n\nITN has long been respected in the news industry as a source of reliable information and news, and as a result the service has won many awards for their programmes, the latest being in May 2011 when \"News at Ten\" was named best news programme by the Royal Television Society and BAFTA.\n\nBetween 6 am and 9.25 am on Monday to Friday, ITV broadcast two breakfast programmes called \"Good Morning Britain\" and \"Lorraine\". \"Good Morning Britain\" keeps viewers up to date with all the latest news, sports, features and weather, whilst \"Lorraine\" predominantly focuses on celebrity interviews, recipes, fashion and showbiz.\n\nThe regional ITV companies are required to provide local news as part of their franchise agreement, with the main local bulletin at 6pm and regional bulletins located after each national news programme. In addition to this, traditionally ITV companies would provide other regional programming based on current affairs, entertainment or drama. However, apart from a monthly political programme, most non-news regional programming in the English regions was dropped by ITV plc in 2009, although it continues in Wales and the Channel Islands, as well as on STV and UTV & from 2014 ITV Border Scotland. On 14 January 2013, ITV plc regional news programmes titles were discontinued in favour of more generic branding under the \"ITV News\" title with the region listed as the subheading. However some \"heritage\" brand names were retained including Calendar, Granada Reports and Lookaround. On the 28 June 2014, ITV Cymru Wales News returned to its historic name of Wales at Six.\n\n\n\nThe ITV National Weather forecast was first broadcast in 1989, using data supplied by the Met Office, and was presented by a number of weather forecasters. The forecasts are sponsored in which the sponsors message, would appear prior to and following the forecast. The forecasts are made immediately after the main national news bulletins.\n\nPrior to the creation of the national forecast, regional forecast provided by each regional companies were shown in each region only. The regional forecasts today are incorporated into the main regional news bulletins, and in the summer months, includes a Pollen Count.\n\nITV covers many popular sports. The channel emphasises coverage of football, with the channel previously holding the UK terrestrial rights to the UEFA Champions League and with the channel sharing coverage of international football events such as the World Cup with the BBC. On 30 March 2007, The Football Association announced that it had agreed a new four-year £425m television deal for ITV and Setanta Sports to show FA Cup and England international matches (the Scottish regional broadcaster STV blacks out those games and replaces them with regular programming). The deal with the FA represented a 42% increase on the existing deal with BBC Sport and BSkyB.\n\nIn May 2009, ITV acquired the rights to broadcast live cricket from the Indian Premier League. The network also covers motorsport, rugby, wrestling, and other sports.\n\nThe network broadcasts children's programming under the CITV (Children's ITV) strand. Children's programming was originally provided during weekday afternoons and weekend mornings, however following the launch of the CITV Channel in 2006, all children's programming, with the exception of the weekend ITV Breakfast slot, were relocated from the ITV line-up to the CITV channel in 2007, a move which was challenged by Ofcom in April 2007.\n\nThe Public Teletext Licence allows the holder to broadcast a text-based information service around the clock on Channel 3 (as well as Channel 4 and S4C) frequencies. Teletext on ITV was provided by ORACLE from 1974 until 1993 and from 1993 to 2010 by Teletext Ltd., whose news, sport and TV listings pages rivalled the BBC's offering, Ceefax on terrestrial and BBC Red Button on digital. Teletext Ltd. also provided digital teletext for the Channel 3 services, as well as the text output for both Channel 4 and S4C under the same licence and Channel 5. However, the licence was revoked by Ofcom on 29 January 2010 for failing to provide news and local non-news information on ITV and there is currently no teletext licence holder for ITV.\n\nSchools programming on the network began in 1957 in some regions and expanded as more regions began broadcasting. It is a contractual obligation for the ITV company to broadcast schools programming, and this was initially broadcast as part of the normal scheduling. The programmes were moved into a segment for broadcast during the day in the 1960s, under the banner \"Independent Television for Schools and Colleges\" and from 1987 were broadcast on Channel 4 in the \"ITV Schools on Channel 4\" segment. In 1993, this segment became \"Channel 4 Schools\" and later in 2000 \"4Learning\". These strands of programming consisted of schools programming from all the ITV companies or from independent sources. The schools strand itself is now defunct, with no particular branding segment used.\n\nITV (as UTV) is widely available in Ireland, where it is received directly in areas bordering Northern Ireland, or in coastal areas from Wales (as ITV Cymru Wales). Until 2015, it was also carried on cable, when it was replaced by UTV Ireland, which was itself replaced by be3, now Virgin Media Three. It is also available on cable and IPTV in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Since 27 March 2013, it has been offered by the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the BFBS3 TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes.\n\nSince the launch of ITV, there have been concerns from politicians and the press that ITV faced a conflict concerning programme audiences and advertisers. As advertisers are reluctant to buy advertising space around low viewing programmes, there is a pressure on ITV to broadcast more popular programmes in peak times. This has become more profound in recent years following a relaxation in regulation and significantly more competition in the advertising market following the huge increase in commercial channels. In recent years, programmes have started to dominate from the reality television genre including the celebrity and talent show subgenres. This has led to accusations of ITV 'dumbing down' their programmes and appealing to the 'lowest common denominator', accusations that are at odds with the network's status as a public service broadcaster. ITV was also heavily criticised for scaling back its regional programmes, including regional news.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "21780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21780", "title": "NBC", "text": "NBC\n\nThe National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American English-language commercial terrestrial radio and television network that is a flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at 10 Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and Philadelphia (at the Comcast Technology Center). The network is one of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \"Peacock Network\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, introduced in 1956 to promote the company's innovations in early color broadcasting. It became the network's official emblem in 1979.\n\nFounded in 1926 by the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), NBC is the oldest major broadcast network in the United States. At that time the parent company of RCA was General Electric (GE). In 1932, GE was forced to sell RCA and NBC as a result of antitrust charges.\n\nIn 1986, control of NBC passed back to General Electric (GE) through its $6.4 billion purchase of RCA. GE immediately began to liquidate RCA's various divisions, but retained NBC. Following the acquisition by GE, Bob Wright served as chief executive officer of NBC, remaining in that position until his retirement in 2007, when he was succeeded by Jeff Zucker.\n\nIn 2003, French media company Vivendi merged its entertainment assets with GE, forming NBC Universal. Comcast purchased a controlling interest in the company in 2011, and acquired General Electric's remaining stake in 2013. Following the Comcast merger, Zucker left NBCUniversal and was replaced as CEO by Comcast executive Steve Burke.\n\nNBC has thirteen owned-and-operated stations and nearly 200 affiliates throughout the United States and its territories, some of which are also available in Canada and/or Mexico via pay-television providers or in border areas over-the-air; NBC also maintains brand licensing agreements for international channels in South Korea and Germany.\n\nDuring a period of early broadcast business consolidation, radio manufacturer Radio Corporation of America (RCA) acquired New York City radio station WEAF from American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T). Westinghouse, a shareholder in RCA, had a competing outlet in Newark, New Jersey pioneer station WJZ (no relation to the radio and television station in Baltimore currently using those call letters), which also served as the flagship for a loosely structured network. This station was transferred from Westinghouse to RCA in 1923, and moved to New York City.\n\nWEAF acted as a laboratory for AT&T's manufacturing and supply outlet Western Electric, whose products included transmitters and antennas. The Bell System, AT&T's telephone utility, was developing technologies to transmit voice- and music-grade audio over short and long distances, using both wireless and wired methods. The 1922 creation of WEAF offered a research-and-development center for those activities. WEAF maintained a regular schedule of radio programs, including some of the first commercially sponsored programs, and was an immediate success. In an early example of \"chain\" or \"networking\" broadcasting, the station linked with Outlet Company-owned WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island; and with AT&T's station in Washington, D.C., WCAP.\n\nNew parent RCA saw an advantage in sharing programming, and after getting a license for radio station WRC in Washington, D.C., in 1923, attempted to transmit audio between cities via low-quality telegraph lines. AT&T refused outside companies access to its high-quality phone lines. The early effort fared poorly, since the uninsulated telegraph lines were susceptible to atmospheric and other electrical interference.\n\nIn 1925, AT&T decided that WEAF and its embryonic network were incompatible with the company's primary goal of providing a telephone service. AT&T offered to sell the station to RCA in a deal that included the right to lease AT&T's phone lines for network transmission.\n\nRCA spent $1 million to purchase WEAF and Washington sister station WCAP, shut down the latter station, and merged its facilities with surviving station WRC; in late 1926, it subsequently announced the creation of a new division known as the National Broadcasting Company. The division's ownership was split among RCA (a majority partner at 50%), its founding corporate parent General Electric (which owned 30%) and Westinghouse (which owned the remaining 20%). NBC officially started broadcasting on November 15, 1926.\n\nWEAF and WJZ, the flagships of the two earlier networks, were operated side-by-side for about a year as part of the new NBC. On January 1, 1927, NBC formally divided their respective marketing strategies: the \"Red Network\" offered commercially sponsored entertainment and music programming; the \"Blue Network\" mostly carried sustaining – or non-sponsored – broadcasts, especially news and cultural programs. Various histories of NBC suggest the color designations for the two networks came from the color of the pushpins NBC engineers used to designate affiliate stations of WEAF (red) and WJZ (blue), or from the use of double-ended red and blue colored pencils.\nOn April 5, 1927, NBC expanded to the West Coast with the launch of the NBC Orange Network, also known as the Pacific Coast Network. This was followed by the debut of the NBC Gold Network, also known as the Pacific Gold Network, on October 18, 1931. The Orange Network carried Red Network programming, and the Gold Network carried programming from the Blue Network. Initially, the Orange Network recreated Eastern Red Network programming for West Coast stations at KPO in San Francisco. In 1936, the Orange Network affiliate stations became part of the Red Network, and at the same time, the Gold Network became part of the Blue Network.\n\nIn the 1930s, NBC also developed a network for shortwave radio stations, called the NBC White Network.\n\nIn 1927, NBC moved its operations to 711 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, occupying the upper floors of a building designed by architect Floyd Brown. NBC outgrew the Fifth Avenue facilities in 1933.\n\nIn 1930, General Electric was charged with antitrust violations, resulting in the company's decision to divest itself of RCA. The newly separate company signed leases to move its corporate headquarters into the new Rockefeller Center in 1931. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., founder and financier of Rockefeller Center, arranged the deal with GE chairman Owen D. Young and RCA president David Sarnoff. When it moved into the complex in 1933, RCA became the lead tenant at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, known as the \"RCA Building\" (later the GE Building, now the Comcast Building), which housed NBC's production studios as well as theaters for RCA-owned RKO Pictures.\n\nThe iconic three-note NBC chimes came about after several years of development. The three-note sequence, G-E'-C', was first heard over Red Network affiliate WSB in Atlanta, with a second inversion C-major triad as its outline. An executive at NBC's New York headquarters heard the WSB version of the notes during the networked broadcast of a Georgia Tech football game and asked permission to use it on the national network. NBC started to use the chimes sequence in 1931, and it eventually became the first audio trademark to be accepted by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nA variant sequence with an additional note, G-E'-C'-G, known as \"the fourth chime\", was used during significant events of extreme urgency (including during World War II, especially in the wake of the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor; on D-Day and during disasters). The NBC chimes were mechanized in 1932 by Rangertone founder Richard H. Ranger; their purpose was to send a low-level signal of constant amplitude that would be heard by the various switching stations manned by NBC and AT&T engineers, and to be used as a system cue for switching individual stations between the Red and Blue network feeds. Contrary to popular legend, the G-E'-C' notes were not originally intended to reference to the General Electric Company (an early shareholder in NBC's founding parent RCA and whose Schenectady, New York radio station, WGY, was an early affiliate of NBC Red). The three-note sequence remains in use by the NBC television network, most notably incorporated into the John Williams-composed theme music used by NBC News, \"The Mission\" (first composed in 1985 for \"NBC Nightly News\").\n\nIn 1934, the Mutual Broadcasting System filed a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), following the government agency's creation, claiming it ran into difficulties trying to establish new radio stations in a market largely controlled by NBC and the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS). In 1938, the FCC began a series of investigations into the monopolistic effects of network broadcasting. A report published by the Commission in 1939 found that NBC's two networks and its owned-and-operated stations dominated audiences, affiliates and advertising in American radio; this led the Commission to file an order to RCA to divest itself of either NBC Red or NBC Blue.\n\nAfter Mutual's appeals were rejected by the FCC, RCA filed its own appeal to overturn the divestiture order. However, in 1941, the company decided to sell NBC Blue in the event its appeal was denied. The Blue Network was formally named NBC Blue Network, Inc. and NBC Red became NBC Red Network, Inc. for corporate purposes. Both networks formally divorced their operations on January 8, 1942, with the Blue Network being referred to on-air as either \"Blue\" or \"Blue Network\", and Blue Network Company, Inc. serving as its official corporate name. NBC Red, meanwhile, became known on-air as simply \"NBC\". Investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. placed a $7.5 million bid for NBC Blue, an offer that was rejected by NBC executive Mark Woods and RCA president David Sarnoff.\n\nAfter losing on final appeal before the U.S. Supreme Court in May 1943, RCA sold Blue Network Company, Inc., for $8 million to the American Broadcasting System, a recently founded company owned by Life Savers magnate Edward J. Noble. After the sale was completed on October 12, 1943, Noble acquired the rights to the Blue Network name, leases on landlines, the New York studios, two-and-a-half radio stations (WJZ in Newark/New York City; KGO in San Francisco and WENR in Chicago, which shared a frequency with Prairie Farmer station WLS); contracts with actors; and agreements with around 60 affiliates. In turn, to comply with FCC radio station ownership limits of the time, Noble sold off his existing New York City radio station WMCA. Noble, who wanted a better name for the network, acquired the branding rights to the \"American Broadcasting Company\" name from George B. Storer in 1944. The Blue Network became ABC officially on June 15, 1945, after the sale was completed.\n\nNBC became home to many of the most popular performers and programs on the air. Bing Crosby, Al Jolson, Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Bob Hope, Fred Allen, and Burns and Allen called NBC home, as did Arturo Toscanini's NBC Symphony Orchestra, which the network helped him create. Other programs featured on the network included \"Vic and Sade\", \"Fibber McGee and Molly\", \"The Great Gildersleeve\" (arguably broadcasting's first spin-off program, from \"Fibber McGee\"), \"One Man's Family\", \"Ma Perkins\" and \"Death Valley Days\". NBC stations were often the most powerful, and some occupied unique clear-channel national frequencies, reaching hundreds or thousands of miles at night.\n\nIn the late 1940s, rival CBS gained ground by allowing radio stars to use their own production companies to produce programs, which became a profitable move for much of its talent. In the early years of radio, stars and programs commonly hopped between networks when their short-term contracts expired. During 1948 and 1949, beginning with the nation's top radio star, Jack Benny, many NBC performers – including Edgar Bergen and Charlie McCarthy, Burns and Allen and Frank Sinatra – jumped to CBS.\n\nIn addition, NBC stars began migrating to television, including comedian Milton Berle, whose \"Texaco Star Theater\" on the network became television's first major hit. Conductor Arturo Toscanini conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in ten television concerts on NBC between 1948 and 1952. The concerts were broadcast on both television and radio, in what perhaps was the first such instance of simulcasting. Two of the concerts were historic firsts – the first complete telecast of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, and the first complete telecast of Verdi's \"Aida\" (starring Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker), performed in concert rather than with scenery and costumes.\n\nAiming to keep classic radio alive as television matured, and to challenge CBS's Sunday night radio lineup, which featured much of the programs and talent that had moved to that network following the defection of Jack Benny to CBS, NBC launched \"The Big Show\" in November 1950. This 90-minute variety show updated radio's earliest musical variety style with sophisticated comedy and dramatic presentations. Featuring stage legend Tallulah Bankhead as hostess, it lured prestigious entertainers, including Fred Allen, Groucho Marx, Lauritz Melchior, Ethel Barrymore, Louis Armstrong, Ethel Merman, Bob Hope, Danny Thomas, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Ella Fitzgerald. However, \"The Big Show\"s initial success did not last despite critical praise, as most of its potential listeners were increasingly becoming television viewers. The show lasted two years, with NBC losing around $1 million on the project (the network was only able to sell advertising time during the middle half-hour of the program each week).\n\nNBC's last major radio programming push, beginning on June 12, 1955, was \"Monitor\", a creation of NBC President Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver, who also created the innovative programs \"Today\", \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Home\" for the companion television network. \"Monitor\" was a continuous all-weekend mixture of music, news, interviews, and features, with a variety of hosts including well-known television personalities Dave Garroway, Hugh Downs, Ed McMahon, Joe Garagiola and Gene Rayburn. The potpourri show tried to keep vintage radio alive by featuring segments from Jim and Marian Jordan (in character as Fibber McGee and Molly); Peg Lynch's dialog comedy \"Ethel and Albert\" (with Alan Bunce); and iconoclastic satirist Henry Morgan. \"Monitor\" was a success for a number of years, but after the mid-1960s, local stations, especially those in larger markets, were reluctant to break from their established formats to run non-conforming network programming. One exception was \"Toscanini: The Man Behind the Legend\", a weekly series commemorating the great conductor's NBC broadcasts and recordings which ran for several years beginning in 1963. After \"Monitor\" ended its 20-year run on January 26, 1975, little remained of NBC network radio beyond hourly newscasts and news features, and Sunday morning religious program \"The Eternal Light\".\n\nOn June 18, 1975, NBC launched the NBC News and Information Service (NIS), which provided up to 55 minutes of news per hour around the clock to local stations that wanted to adopt an all-news radio format. NBC carried the service on WRC in Washington, and on its owned-and-operated FM stations in New York City, Chicago and San Francisco. NIS attracted several dozen subscribing stations, but by the fall of 1976, NBC determined that it could not project that the service would ever become profitable and gave its affiliates six months' notice that it would be discontinued. NIS ended operations on May 29, 1977. In 1979, NBC launched The Source, a modestly successful secondary network providing news and short features to FM rock stations.\n\nThe NBC Radio Network also pioneered personal advice call-in national talk radio with a satellite-distributed evening talk show, TalkNet; the program featured Bruce Williams (providing personal financial advice), Bernard Meltzer (personal and financial advice) and Sally Jessy Raphael (personal and romantic advice). While never much of a ratings success, TalkNet nonetheless helped further the national talk radio format. For affiliates, many of them struggling AM stations, TalkNet helped fill evening time slots with free programming, allowing the stations to sell local advertising in a dynamic format without the cost associated with producing local programming. Some in the industry feared this trend would lead to increasing control of radio content by networks and syndicators.\n\nGeneral Electric acquired RCA in 1986, and with it NBC, signaling the beginning of the end of NBC Radio. Three factors led to the radio division's demise: GE decided that radio did not fit its strategy, while the radio division had not been profitable for many years. In addition, FCC ownership rules at the time prevented companies acquiring broadcast properties from owning both a radio and television division. In the summer of 1987, GE sold NBC Radio's network operations to Westwood One, and sold off the NBC-owned stations to various buyers. By 1990, the NBC Radio Network as an independent programming service was pretty much dissolved, becoming a brand name for content produced by Westwood One, and ultimately by CBS Radio. The Mutual Broadcasting System, which Westwood One had acquired two years earlier, met the same fate, and essentially merged with NBC Radio.\n\nGE's divestiture of NBC's entire radio division was the first cannon shot of what would play out in the national broadcast media, as each of the Big Three broadcast networks were soon acquired by other corporate entities. NBC was a particularly noteworthy case in that it was the first to be acquired – and was bought by a conglomerate \"outside\" the broadcast industry as GE otherwise primarily served as a manufacturing company. Prior to the GE acquisition, NBC operated its radio division partly out of tradition, and partly to meet its then-FCC-mandated requirement to distribute programming for the public good (the broadcast airwaves are owned by the public; as that broadcast spectrum is limited and only so many broadcast stations existed, this served as the basis for government regulation requiring broadcasters to provide certain content that meets the needs of the public). Syndicators such as Westwood One were not subject to such rules as they did not own any stations. GE's divestiture of NBC Radio – known as \"America's First Network\" – in many ways marked the \"beginning of the end\" of the old era of regulated broadcasting and the ushering in of the new, largely unregulated industry that is present today.\n\nBy the late 1990s, Westwood One was producing NBC Radio-branded newscasts on weekday mornings. These were discontinued in 1999 (along with Mutual branded newscasts), and the few remaining NBC Radio Network affiliates became affiliates of CNN Radio, carrying the Westwood-owned service's hourly newscasts 24 hours a day. In 2003, Westwood One began distributing NBC News Radio, a new service featuring minute-long news updates read by television anchors and reporters from NBC News and MSNBC, with content written by Westwood One employees.\n\nOn March 1, 2012, Dial Global announced that it would discontinue CNN Radio, and replace it with an expansion of NBC News Radio on April 1, 2012. This marked the first time since Westwood One's purchase of NBC Radio and its properties that NBC would have a 24-hour presence on radio. A previous program, \"First Light\", placed new emphasis on the NBC brand after diminishing it over the years. With the change, NBC News Radio expanded its offerings from 60-second news updates airing only on weekdays to feature two hourly full-length newscasts 24 hours a day. Subsequently, on September 4, 2012, Dial Global launched a sports-talk radio service, NBC Sports Radio.\n\nNBC News Radio has been distributed by iHeartMedia and its TTWN Networks since July 2016. It is provided to the network's 24/7 News Source affiliates and includes a top of the hour newscast along with other audio content which is heard on over 1000 radio stations.\n\nFor many years, NBC was closely identified with David Sarnoff, who used it as a vehicle to sell consumer electronics. RCA and Sarnoff had captured the spotlight by introducing all-electronic television to the public at the 1939–40 New York World's Fair, simultaneously initiating a regular schedule of programs on the NBC-RCA television station in New York City. President Franklin D. Roosevelt appeared at the fair before the NBC camera, becoming the first U.S. president to appear on television on April 30, 1939 (an actual, off-the-monitor photograph of the FDR telecast is available at the David Sarnoff Library). The broadcast was transmitted by NBC's New York television station W2XBS Channel 1 (later WNBC-TV; now WNBC, channel 4) and was seen by about 1,000 viewers within the station's roughly coverage area from its transmitter at the Empire State Building.\n\nThe following day (May 1), four models of RCA television sets went on sale to the general public in various department stores around New York City, which were promoted in a series of splashy newspaper ads. DuMont Laboratories (and others) had actually offered the first home sets in 1938 in anticipation of NBC's announced April 1939 television launch. Later in 1939, NBC took its cameras to professional football and baseball games in the New York City area, establishing many \"firsts\" in television broadcasting.\n\nReportedly, the first NBC Television \"network\" program was broadcast on January 12, 1940, when a play titled \"Meet The Wife\" was originated at the W2XBS studios at Rockefeller Center and rebroadcast by W2XB/W2XAF (now WRGB) in Schenectady, which received the New York station directly off-air from a tower atop a mountain and relayed the live signal to the Capital District. About this time, occasional special events were also broadcast in Philadelphia (over W3XE, later called WPTZ, now known as KYW-TV) as well as Schenectady. The most ambitious NBC television \"network\" program of the pre-war era was the telecast of the Republican National Convention held in Philadelphia in the summer of 1940, which was fed live to the New York City and Schenectady stations. However, despite major promotion by RCA, television sales in New York during 1939 and 1940 were disappointing, primarily due to the high cost of the sets, and the lack of compelling regularly scheduled programming. Most sets were sold to bars, hotels and other public places, where the general public viewed special sports and news events. One special event was Franklin D. Roosevelt's second and final appearance on live television, when his speech at Madison Square Garden on October 28, 1940, was telecast over W2XBS to receivers in the New York City area.\nTelevision's experimental period ended, as the FCC allowed full-fledged commercial television broadcasts to begin on July 1, 1941. NBC station W2XBS in New York City received the first commercial license, adopting the call letters WNBT. The first official, paid television advertisement broadcast by any U.S. station was for watch manufacturer Bulova, which aired that day, just before the start of a Brooklyn Dodgers baseball telecast on WNBT. The ad consisted of test pattern, featuring the newly assigned WNBT call letters, which was modified to resemble a clock – complete with functioning hands – with the Bulova logo (featuring the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\") in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern (a photograph of the NBC camera setting up the test pattern-advertisement for that ad can be seen at this page). Among the programs that aired during the first week of WNBT's new, commercial schedule was \"The Sunoco News\", a simulcast of the Sun Oil-sponsored NBC Radio program anchored by Lowell Thomas; amateur boxing at Jamaica Arena; the Eastern Clay Courts tennis championships; programming from the USO; the spelling bee-type game show \"Words on the Wing\"; a few feature films; and a one-time-only, test broadcast of the game show \"Truth or Consequences\", sponsored by Lever Brothers.\n\nPrior to the first commercial television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939 over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors at the time to have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for Ivory Soap, he held up a bar of the product; for Mobilgas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel; and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful. Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed in the early years of the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show \"The Voice of Firestone Televues\", a television offshoot of \"The Voice of Firestone\", a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program.\nOn V-E Day, May 8, 1945, WNBT broadcast several hours of news coverage and remotes from around New York City. This event was promoted in advance by NBC with a direct-mail card sent to television set owners in the New York area. At one point, a WNBT camera placed atop the marquee of the Hotel Astor panned the crowd below celebrating the end of the war in Europe. The vivid coverage was a prelude to television's rapid growth after the war ended.\n\nThe NBC television network grew from its initial post-war lineup of four stations. The 1947 World Series featured two New York City area teams (the Yankees and the Dodgers), and television sales boomed locally, since the games were being telecast in the New York market. Additional stations along the East Coast and in the Midwest were connected by coaxial cable through the late 1940s, and in September 1951 the first transcontinental telecasts took place.\n\nThe post-war 1940s and early 1950s brought success for NBC in the new medium. Television's first major star, Milton Berle, whose \"Texaco Star Theatre\" began in June 1948, drew the first large audiences to NBC Television. Under its innovative president, Sylvester \"Pat\" Weaver, the network launched \"Today\" and \"The Tonight Show\", which would bookend the broadcast day for over 50 years, and which still lead their competitors. Weaver, who also launched the genre of periodic 90-minute network \"spectaculars\", network-produced motion pictures and the live 90-minute Sunday afternoon series \"Wide Wide World\", left the network in 1955 in a dispute with its chairman David Sarnoff, who subsequently named his son Robert Sarnoff as president.\n\nIn 1951, NBC commissioned Italian-American composer Gian Carlo Menotti to compose the first opera ever written for television; Menotti came up with \"Amahl and the Night Visitors\", a 45-minute work for which he wrote both music and libretto, about a disabled shepherd boy who meets the Three Wise Men and is miraculously cured when he offers his crutch to the newborn Christ Child. It was such a stunning success that it was repeated every year on NBC from 1951 to 1966, when a dispute between Menotti and NBC ended the broadcasts. However, by 1978, Menotti and NBC had patched things up, and an all-new production of the opera, filmed partly on location in the Middle East, was telecast that year.\n\nWhile rival CBS broadcast the first color television programs in the United States, their system was incompatible with the millions of black and white sets in use at the time. After a series of limited, incompatible color broadcasts (mostly scheduled during the day), CBS abandoned the system and broadcasts. This opened the door for the RCA compatible color system to be adopted as the U.S. standard. RCA convinced the FCC to approve its color system in December 1953. NBC was ready with color programming within days of the Commission's decision. NBC began the transition with a few shows in 1954, and broadcast its first program to air all episodes in color beginning that summer, \"The Marriage\".\n\nIn 1955, NBC broadcast a live production in color of \"Peter Pan\", a new Broadway musical adaptation of J. M. Barrie's beloved play, on the \"Producers' Showcase\" anthology series, The first such telecast of its kind, the broadcast starred the musical's entire original cast, led by Mary Martin as Peter and Cyril Ritchard in a dual role as Mr. Darling and Captain Hook. The broadcast drew the highest ratings for a television program for that period. It was so successful that NBC restaged it as a live broadcast a mere ten months later; in 1960, long after \"Producers' Showcase\" had ended its run, \"Peter Pan\", with most of the 1955 cast, was restaged again, this time as a standalone special, and was videotaped so that it would no longer have to be performed live on television.\n\nIn 1956, NBC started a subsidiary, California National Productions (CNP), for merchandising, syndication and NBC opera company operations with the production of Silent Services. By 1957, NBC planned to remove the opera company from CNP and CNP was in discussion with MGM Television about handling syndication distribution for MGM series.\n\nDuring a National Association of Broadcasters meeting in Chicago in 1956, NBC announced that its owned-and-operated station in that market, WNBQ (now WMAQ-TV), had become the first television station in the country to broadcast its programming in color (airing at least six hours of color broadcasts each day). In 1959, NBC premiered a televised version of the radio program \"The Bell Telephone Hour\", which aired in color from its debut; the program would continue on the NBC television network for nine more years until it ended in 1968.\n\nIn 1961, NBC approached Walt Disney about acquiring the rights to his anthology series, offering to produce the program in color. Disney was in the midst of negotiating a new contract to keep the program (then known as \"Walt Disney Presents\") on ABC, however ABC president Leonard Goldenson said that it could not counter the offer, as the network did not have the technical and financial resources to carry the program in color. Disney subsequently struck a deal with NBC, which began airing the anthology series in the format in September 1961 (as \"Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color\"). As many of the Disney programs that aired in black-and-white on ABC were actually filmed in color, they could easily be re-aired in the format on the NBC broadcasts. In January 1962, NBC's telecast of the Rose Bowl became the first college football game ever to be telecast in color.\n\nBy 1963, much of NBC's prime time schedule was presented in color, although some popular series (such as \"The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\", which premiered in late 1964) were broadcast in black-and-white for their entire first season. In the fall of 1965, NBC was broadcasting 95% of its prime time schedule in color (with the exceptions of \"I Dream of Jeannie\" and \"Convoy\"), and began billing itself as \"The Full Color Network.\" Without television sets to sell, rival networks followed more slowly, finally committing to an all-color lineup in prime time in the 1966–67 season. \"Days of Our Lives\" became the first soap opera to premiere in color, when it debuted in November 1965.\n\nNBC contracted with Universal Studios in 1964 to produce the first feature-length film produced for television, \"See How They Run\", which first aired on October 17, 1964; its second television movie, \"The Hanged Man\", aired six weeks later on November 28. Even while the presentations performed well in the ratings, NBC did not broadcast another made-for-TV film for two years.\n\nIn 1967, NBC reached a deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) to acquire the broadcast rights to the classic 1939 film \"The Wizard of Oz\". CBS, which had televised the film annually since 1956, refused to meet MGM's increased fee to renew its television rights. \"Oz\" had been, up to then, one of the few programs that CBS had telecast in color. However, by 1967, color broadcasts had become standard on television, and the film simply became another title in the list of specials that NBC telecast in the format. The film's showings on NBC were distinctive as it televised \"The Wizard of Oz\" without a hosted introduction, as CBS had long done; it was also slightly edited for time in order to make room to air more commercials. Despite the cuts, however, it continued to score excellent television ratings in those pre-VCR days, as audiences were generally unable to see the film any other way at that time. NBC aired \"The Wizard of Oz\" each year from 1968 to 1976, when CBS, realizing that they may have committed a colossal blunder by letting a huge ratings success like \"Oz\" go to another network, agreed to pay MGM more money to re-acquire the rights to show the film.\n\nThe late 1960s brought big changes in the programming practices of the major television networks. As baby boomers reached adulthood, NBC, CBS and ABC began to realize that much of their existing programming had not only been running for years but had audiences that skewed older. In order to attract the large youth population that was highly attractive to advertisers, the networks moved to clean house of a number of veteran shows. In NBC's case, this included programs like \"The Bell Telephone Hour\" and \"Sing Along With Mitch\", which both had an average viewer age of 50. During this period, the networks came to define adults between the ages of 18 and 49 as their main target audience, although depending on the show, this could be subdivided into other age demos: 35–45, 18–25 or 18–35. Regardless of the exact target demographic, the general idea was to appeal to viewers who were not close to retirement age and to modernize television programming, which the networks felt overall was stuck in a 1950s mentality, to closely resemble contemporary American society.\n\nThe 1970s started strongly for NBC thanks to hits like \"Adam-12\", \"Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In\", \"Ironside\", \"The Dean Martin Show\" and \"The Flip Wilson Show\". However, despite the success of such new shows as the \"NBC Mystery Movie\", \"Sanford and Son\", \"Chico and the Man\", \"Little House on the Prairie\", \"The Midnight Special\", \"The Rockford Files\", \"Police Woman\" and \"Emergency!\", as well as continued success from veterans like \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" and \"The Wonderful World of Disney\", the network entered a slump in the middle of the decade. \"Disney\", in particular, saw its ratings nosedive once CBS put \"60 Minutes\" up against the program in the Sunday 7:00 p.m. time slot in the 1975–76 season.\n\nIn 1974, under new president Herb Schlosser, the network tried to attract younger viewers with a series of costly movies, miniseries and specials. This failed to attract the desirable 18–34 demographic, and simultaneously alienated older viewers. None of the new prime-time shows that NBC introduced in the fall of 1975 earned a second season renewal, all failing in the face of established competition. The network's lone breakout success that season was the groundbreaking late-night comedy/variety show, \"NBC's Saturday Night\" – which would be renamed \"Saturday Night Live\" in 1976, after the cancellation of a Howard Cosell-hosted program of the same title on ABC – which replaced reruns of \"The Tonight Show\" that previously aired in its Saturday time slot.\n\nIn 1978, Schlosser was promoted to executive vice president at RCA, and a desperate NBC lured Fred Silverman away from top-rated ABC to turn its fortunes around. With the notable exceptions of \"CHiPs\", \"Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters\", \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (and its spin-off \"The Facts of Life\"), \"Real People\" and the miniseries \"Shōgun\", Silverman was unable to pull out a hit. Failures accumulated rapidly under his watch (such as \"Hello, Larry\", \"Supertrain\", \"Pink Lady and Jeff\", \"The Krofft Superstar Hour\", season six of \"Saturday Night Live\", and \"The Waverly Wonders\"). Many of them were beaten in the ratings by shows that Silverman had greenlit during his previous tenures at CBS and ABC.\n\nDuring this time, several longtime affiliates also defected from NBC in markets such as Atlanta (WSB-TV), Baltimore (WBAL-TV), Baton Rouge (WBRZ-TV), Charlotte (WSOC-TV), Dayton (WDTN), Indianapolis (WRTV), Jacksonville (WTLV), Minneapolis-St. Paul (KSTP-TV), San Diego (KGTV), Schenectady (WRGB) and Wheeling (WTRF-TV). Most were wooed away by ABC, which had lifted out of last place to become the #1 network during the late 1970s and early 1980s, while WBAL-TV, WRGB and WTRF-TV went to CBS; WBAL-TV was originally to go to ABC, but the station decided against it because ABC's evening newscasts had attracted ratings too dismal for them to consider doing so. In the case of WSB-TV and WSOC-TV, which have both since become ABC affiliates, both stations were (and remain) under common ownership with Cox Enterprises, with its other NBC affiliate at the time, WIIC-TV in Pittsburgh (which would become WPXI in 1981 and also remains owned by Cox), only staying with the network because WIIC-TV itself was a distant third to CBS-affiliated powerhouse KDKA-TV and ABC affiliate WTAE-TV (KDKA-TV, owned at the time by Group W and now owned by CBS, infamously passed up affiliating with NBC after Westinghouse bought the station from DuMont in 1954, leading to an acrimonious relationship between NBC and Westinghouse that lasted for years afterward). In markets such as San Diego, Charlotte and Jacksonville, NBC had little choice but to affiliate with a UHF station, with the San Diego station (KNSD) eventually becoming an NBC O&O. In Wheeling, NBC ultimately upgraded its affiliation when it partnered with WTOV-TV in nearby Steubenville, Ohio, overtaking former affiliate WTRF-TV in the ratings by a large margin. Other smaller television markets like Yuma, Arizona waited many years to get another local NBC affiliate (first with KIVA, and later KYMA). The stations in Baltimore, Dayton and Jacksonville, however, have since rejoined the network.\n\nAfter President Jimmy Carter pulled the U.S. team out of the 1980 Summer Olympics, NBC canceled a planned 150 hours of coverage (which had cost $87 million for the broadcast rights), placing the network's future in doubt. It had been counting on the broadcasts to help promote its new fall shows, and had been estimated to pull in $170 million in advertising revenue.\n\nThe press was merciless towards Silverman, but the two most savage attacks on his leadership came from within the network. The company that composed the promotional theme for NBC's \"Proud as a Peacock\" image campaign created a parody song called \"Loud as a Peacock\", which was broadcast on Don Imus' program on WNBC radio in New York. Its lyrics blamed Silverman for the network's problems (\"The Peacock's dead, so thank you, Fred\"). An angered Silverman ordered all remaining copies of the spoof destroyed, though technology eventually allowed its wide propagation to the Internet in later generations from a few remaining copies. \"Saturday Night Live\" writer and occasional performer Al Franken satirized Silverman in a sketch on the program titled \"A Limo For A Lame-O\", where he presented a chart with the top-10 rated programs for that season and commented that there was \"not one \"N\"\" on the list. Silverman later admitted he \"never liked Al Franken to begin with\", and the sketch ruined Franken's chance of succeeding Lorne Michaels as executive producer of \"SNL\" following his 1980 departure (with the position going to Jean Doumanian, who was fired after one season following declining ratings and negative critical reviews. Michaels would later return to the show in 1985).\n\nFred Silverman resigned as entertainment president in the summer of 1981. Grant Tinker, a highly regarded producer who co-founded MTM Enterprises with then-wife Mary Tyler Moore, became president of the network and Brandon Tartikoff became president of the entertainment division. Tartikoff inherited a schedule full of aging dramas and very few sitcoms, but showed patience with promising programs. One such show was the critically acclaimed \"Hill Street Blues\", which suffered from poor ratings during its first season. Rather than canceling the show, he moved the Emmy Award-winning police drama from Steven Bochco to Thursdays, where its ratings improved dramatically. He used the same tactics with \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"Cheers\". Shows like these were able to get the same ad revenue as their higher-rated competition because of their desirable demographics, upscale adults ages 18–34. While the network claimed moderate successes with \"Gimme a Break!\", \"Silver Spoons\", \"Knight Rider\" and \"Remington Steele\", its biggest hit during this period was \"The A-Team\", which, at 10th place, was the network's only program to rank in the Nielsen Top-20 for the 1982–83 season, and ascended to fourth place the following year. These shows helped NBC through the disastrous 1983–84 season, which saw none of its nine new fall shows gaining a second year.\n\nIn February 1982, NBC canceled Tom Snyder's \"The Tomorrow Show\" and gave the 12:35 a.m. time slot to 34-year-old comedian David Letterman. Though Letterman was unsuccessful with his weekday morning talk show effort for the network (which debuted on June 23, 1980), \"Late Night with David Letterman\" proved much more successful, lasting for 11 years and serving as the launching pad for another late-night talk franchise that continues to this day.\n\nIn 1984, the huge success of \"The Cosby Show\" led to a renewed interest in sitcoms, while \"Family Ties\" and \"Cheers\", both of which premiered in 1982 to mediocre ratings (the latter ranking at near dead last among all network shows during the 1982–83 season), saw their viewership increase from having \"Cosby\" as a lead-in. The network rose from third place to second in the ratings during the 1984–85 season and reached first place in 1985–86, with hits \"The Golden Girls\", \"Miami Vice\", \"227\", \"Night Court\", \"Highway to Heaven\" and \"Hunter\". The network's upswing continued late into the decade with \"ALF\", \"Amen\", \"Matlock\", \"L.A. Law\", \"The Hogan Family\", \"A Different World\", \"Empty Nest\", \"Unsolved Mysteries\" and \"In the Heat of the Night\". In 1986, Bob Wright was appointed as chairman of NBC.\n\nIn the fall of 1987, NBC conceived a syndication package for its owned-and-operated stations, under the brand \"Prime Time Begins at 7:30\", consisting of five sitcoms that each aired once a week, and were produced by various production companies contracted by NBC. The series included \"Marblehead Manor\" (from Paramount Television, airing Mondays), centering on a mansion owner and the people who live with him; \"She's the Sheriff\" (from Lorimar-Telepictures and airing Tuesdays), a comeback vehicle for Suzanne Somers which cast her as a widowed county sheriff; a series adapted from the George S. Kaufman play \"You Can't Take It with You\" (airing Wednesdays), starring Harry Morgan; \"Out of This World\" (from MCA Television and airing Thursdays), which starred Maureen Flannigan as a teenager born to an alien father and human mother that develops supernatural abilities on her 15th birthday; and a revival of the short-lived 1983 NBC series \"We Got It Made\" (produced by Fred Silverman for MGM Television and closing out the week on Fridays), as part of an ongoing trend at the time in which former network series were revived in first-run syndication.\n\nThe package was aimed at attracting viewers to NBC stations in the half-hour preceding prime time (8:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zone, 7:00 p.m. elsewhere), and was conceived as a result of the FCC's loosening of the Prime Time Access Rule, legislation passed in 1971 that required networks to turn over the 7:30 p.m. (Eastern) time slot to local stations to program local or syndicated content; and the relaxation of the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, which had prevented networks from producing content from their own syndication units to fill the void. The shows that were part of the package were regularly outrated in many markets by such syndicated game shows as \"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Hollywood Squares\". \"Marblehead Manor\", \"We Got It Made\" and \"You Can't Take It With You\" were cancelled at the end of the 1987–88 season, with \"She's the Sheriff\" lasting one more season in weekend syndication before its cancellation. \"Out of This World\" ran for three additional seasons, airing mainly on weekends, and was the most successful of the five series.\n\nNBC aired the first of eight consecutive Summer Olympic Games broadcasts when it covered the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea. The 1988–89 season saw NBC have an astounding 17 series in Nielsen's year-end Top 30 most-watched network programs; it also ranked at first place in the weekly ratings for more than 12 months, an unprecedented achievement that has not been duplicated since. 1989 however, also served as NBC's final year of covering Major League Baseball (the primary package would move over to CBS for the next four years before NBC regained the rights), having done so in some shape or form since 1947. Nevertheless, the network continued its hot streak into the early 1990s with new hits such as \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\", \"Blossom\" and \"Law & Order\".\n\nIn 1991, Tartikoff left his role as NBC's President of Entertainment to take an executive position at Paramount Pictures. In the course of a decade, he had taken control of a network with no shows in the Nielsen Top 10 and left it with five. Tartikoff was succeeded by Warren Littlefield, whose first years as entertainment president proved shaky as a result of most of the Tartikoff-era hits ending their runs. Some blamed Littlefield for losing David Letterman to CBS after naming Jay Leno as the successor to Johnny Carson on \"The Tonight Show\", following the latter's retirement as host in May 1992. Things turned around with the launches of new hit series such as \"Mad About You\", \"Wings\", \"Sisters\", \"Frasier\", \"Friends\", \"ER\" and \"Will & Grace\".\n\nOne of Tartikoff's late acquisitions, \"Seinfeld\" initially struggled from its debut in 1989 as a summer series, but grew to become one of NBC's top-rated shows after it was moved to Thursdays in the time slot following \"Cheers\". \"Seinfeld\" ended its run in 1998, becoming the latest overall television program in the U.S. to end its final season as the leader in the Nielsen ratings for a single television season. Consequently, \"Friends\" emerged as NBC's biggest television show after the 1998 \"Seinfeld\" final broadcast. It dominated the ratings, never leaving the top five watched shows of the year from its second through tenth seasons and landing on the number-one spot during season eight in the 2001–02 season as the latest sitcom in the U.S. to lead the annual Nielsen primetime television ratings. \"Cheers\" spinoff \"Frasier\" became a critical and commercial success, usually landing in the Nielsen Top 20 – although its ratings were overshadowed to a minor extent by \"Friends\" – and went on to win numerous Emmy Awards (eventually setting a record for a sitcom that lasted until it was overtaken by \"Modern Family\" in 2014). In 1994, the network began branding its strong Thursday night lineup, mainly in reference to the comedies airing in the first two hours, under the \"Must See TV\" tagline (which during the mid- and late 1990s, was also applied to NBC's comedy blocks on other nights, particularly on Tuesdays).\n\nBy the mid-1990s, NBC's sports division, headed by Dick Ebersol, had rights to three of the four major professional sports leagues (the NFL, Major League Baseball and the NBA), the Olympics, and the national powerhouse Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. The \"NBA on NBC\" enjoyed great success in the 1990s due in large part to the Chicago Bulls' run of six championships at the hands of superstar Michael Jordan. However, NBC Sports would suffer a major blow in 1998, when it lost the rights to the American Football Conference (AFC) to CBS, which itself had lost rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) to Fox four years earlier; the deal stripped NBC of National Football League (NFL) game telecasts after 59 years and AFC games after 36 years (dating back to its existence as the American Football League prior to its 1970 merger with the NFL).\n\nLittlefield left NBC in 1998 to pursue a career as a television and film producer, with the network subsequently going through three entertainment presidents in three years. Littlefield was replaced as president of NBC Entertainment by Scott Sassa, who oversaw the development of such shows as \"The West Wing\", \"\" and \"Fear Factor\". After Sassa was reassigned to NBC's West Coast Division, Garth Ancier was named as his replacement in 1999. Jeff Zucker then succeeded Ancier as president of NBC Entertainment in 2000.\n\nAt the start of the 2000s, NBC's fortunes started to take a rapid turn for the worse. That year, NBC's longstanding ratings lead ended as CBS (which had languished in the ratings after losing the NFL) overtook it for first place. In 2001, CBS chose to move its hit reality series \"Survivor\" to serve as the anchor of its Thursday night lineup. Its success was taken as a suggestion that NBC's nearly two decades of dominance on Thursday nights could be broken; even so, the strength of \"Friends\", \"Will & Grace\", \"ER\" and \"Just Shoot Me!\" (the latter of which saw its highest viewership following its move to that night in the 2000–01 season) helped the network continue to lead the Thursday ratings. Overall, NBC retook its first place lead that year, and spent much of the next four years (with the exception of the 2002–03 season, when it was briefly jumped again by CBS for first) in the top spot.\n\nOn the other hand, NBC was stripped of the broadcast rights to two other major sports leagues: it lost Major League Baseball to Fox after the 2000 season (by that point, NBC only had alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series and World Series), and, later, the NBA to ABC after the 2001–02 season. After losing the NBA rights, NBC's major sports offerings were reduced to the Olympics (which in 2002, expanded to include rights to the Winter Olympics, as part of a contract that gave it the U.S. television rights to both the Summer and Winter Olympics through 2012), PGA Tour golf events and a floundering Notre Dame football program (however, it would eventually acquire the rights to the National Hockey League in May 2004).\n\nIn October 2001, NBC acquired Spanish-language network Telemundo from Liberty Media and Sony Pictures Entertainment for $2.7 billion, beating out other bidders including CBS/Viacom. The deal was finalized in 2002.\n\nIn 2003, French entertainment conglomerate Vivendi Universal sold 80% of its film and television subsidiary, Vivendi Universal Entertainment, to NBC's parent company, General Electric, integrating the network with Vivendi Universal's various properties (Universal Pictures film studio, Canal+ television networks, & Universal Parks & Resorts theme & amusement parks & resorts) upon completion of the merger of the two companies under the combined NBC Universal brand. NBC Universal was then owned 80% by General Electric and 20% by Vivendi. In 2004, Zucker was promoted to the newly created position of president of NBC Universal Television Group. Kevin Reilly became the new president of NBC Entertainment.\n\nIn 2004, NBC experienced a Three on a match scenario (\"Friends\" and \"Frasier\" ended their runs; Jerry Orbach, who had played one of the most popular characters of its hit \"Law & Order\", died suddenly later that year), and shortly afterward was left with several moderately rated shows and few true hits. In particular, \"Friends\" spin-off \"Joey\", despite a relatively strong start, started to falter in the ratings during its second season. The 2004–05 season saw NBC become the first major network to air select dramas in letterbox over its analog broadcast feed; the move was done in the hopes of attracting new viewers, although the network saw only a slight boost.\n\nIn December 2005, NBC began its first week-long primetime game show event, \"Deal or No Deal\"; the series garnered high ratings, and returning as a weekly series in March 2006. Otherwise, the 2005–06 season was one of the worst for NBC in three decades, with only one fall series, the sitcom \"My Name Is Earl\", surviving for a second season; the sole remaining anchor of the \"Must See TV\" lineup, \"Will & Grace\" also saw its ratings decline. That season, NBC's ratings fell to fourth place, behind a resurgent ABC, Fox (which would eventually become the most-watched U.S. broadcast network in the 2007–08 season) and top-rated CBS (which led for much of the remainder of the decade). During this time, all of the networks faced audience erosion from increased competition by cable television, home video, video games and the Internet, with NBC being the hardest hit.\n\nThe 2006–07 season was a mixed bag for the network, with \"Deal or No Deal\" remaining strong and \"Heroes\" becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights, while the highly touted \"Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip\" (from \"West Wing\" creator Aaron Sorkin) lost a third of its premiere-night viewers by Week 6 and was eventually canceled; two critically acclaimed sitcoms, \"The Office\" and \"30 Rock\", also pulled in modest successes and went on to win the Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years. The network also regained the rights to the NFL after eight years that season when it acquired the \"Sunday Night Football\" package from ESPN (as part of a deal that also saw \"Monday Night Football\" move to ESPN from ABC). However, despite this, NBC remained at a very distant fourth place, barely ranking ahead of The CW.\n\nHowever, NBC did experience success with its summer schedule, despite its declining ratings during the main broadcast season. \"America's Got Talent\", a reality talent competition series that premiered in 2006, earned a 4.6 rating in the 18–49 demographic, higher than that earned by the 2002 premiere of Fox's \"American Idol\". \"Got Talent\" (which is the flagship of an international talent competition franchise) would continue to garner unusually high ratings throughout its summer run. However, NBC decided not to place it in the spring season, and instead use it as a platform to promote their upcoming fall shows. Originally hosted by Regis Philbin, the series is currently hosted by Terry Crews, and continues to garner strong ratings throughout its summer seasons. In March 2007, NBC announced that it would begin offering full-length episodes of its prime time series for streaming on mobile devices, becoming the first U.S. broadcast network to offer on-demand mobile episode content, as the market began shifting away from traditional television.\n\nFollowing the unexpected termination of Kevin Reilly, in 2007, Ben Silverman was appointed president of NBC Entertainment, while Jeff Zucker was promoted to succeed Bob Wright as CEO of NBC. The network failed to generate any new primetime hits during the 2008–09 season (despite the rare good fortune of having the rights to both the Super Bowl and the Summer Olympics in which to promote their new programming slate), the sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" survived for a second season after a six-episode first season, while \"Heroes\" and \"Deal or No Deal\" both collapsed in the ratings and were later canceled (with a revamped \"Deal or No Deal\" being revived for one additional season in syndication). In a March 2009 interview, Zucker had stated that he no longer believed it would be possible for NBC to become #1 in prime time. Ben Silverman left the network in 2009, with Jeff Gaspin replacing him as president of NBC Entertainment.\n\nOn December 3, 2009, Comcast announced they would purchase a 51% controlling stake in NBC Universal from General Electric (which would retain the remaining 49%) for $6.5 billion in cash and $9.1 billion in raised debt. GE used $5.8 billion from the deal to buy out Vivendi's 20% interest in NBC Universal.\n\nNBC's broadcast of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, in February of that year, generated a ratings increase of 21% over its broadcast of the 2006 Winter Games in Torino. The network was criticized for repeatedly showing footage of a crash occurring during practice for an Olympic luge competition that killed Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili. NBC News president Steve Capus ordered the footage not to be shown without his permission and Olympics prime time host Bob Costas promised on-air that the video would not be shown again during the Games. NBC Universal was on track to lose $250 million in advertising revenue on that year's Winter Olympics, failing to make up the $820 million it paid for the U.S. television rights. Even so, with its continuing position in fourth place (although it virtually tied with ABC in many demographics on the strength of NBC's sports broadcasts that year), the 2009–10 season ended with only two scripted shows – \"Community\" and \"Parenthood\", as well as three unscripted shows – \"The Marriage Ref\", \"Who Do You Think You Are?\" and \"Minute to Win It\" – being renewed for second seasons, while other series such as \"Heroes\" and veteran crime drama \"Law & Order\" (the latter of which ended after 20 seasons, tying it with \"Gunsmoke\" as the longest-running prime time drama in U.S. television history) were cancelled.\nAfter Conan O'Brien succeeded Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show\" in 2009, the network gave Leno a new prime time talk show, committing to air it every weeknight at 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific as an inexpensive comedic alternative to the police procedurals and other hour-long dramas typically aired in that time slot. In doing so, NBC became the first major U.S. broadcast network in decades, if ever, to broadcast the same program in a weekdaily prime time strip. Its executives called the decision \"a transformational moment in the history of broadcasting\" and \"in effect, launching five shows.\" Conversely, industry executives criticized the network for abandoning a history of airing quality dramas in the 10:00 hour, and expressed concern that it would hurt NBC by undermining a reputation built on successful scripted series. Citing complaints from many affiliates, which saw their late-evening newscasts drop significantly in the local ratings during \"The Jay Leno Show\"s run, NBC announced on January 10, 2010 that it would drop Leno's show from the 10:00 p.m. slot, with Zucker announcing plans to shift the program (which would have been reduced to a half-hour) into the 11:35 p.m. slot and shift its existing late night lineup (including \"The Tonight Show\") by 30 minutes. The removal of \"The Jay Leno Show\" from its prime time schedule had almost no impact on the network's ratings. The increases NBC experienced in the 2010–11 season compared to 2009–10 were almost entirely attributable to the rising viewership of \"NBC Sunday Night Football\". By 2012, the shows that occupied the 10:00 p.m. time slot drew lower numbers than \"The Jay Leno Show\" did when it aired in that hour two years before. In the spring of 2010, cable provider and multimedia firm Comcast announced it would acquire a majority interest in NBC Universal from General Electric, which would retain a minority stake in the company in the interim.\n\nOn September 24, 2010, Jeff Zucker announced that he would step down as NBC Universal's CEO once the company's merger with Comcast was completed at the end of the year. After the deal was finalized, Steve Burke was named CEO of NBCUniversal and Robert Greenblatt replaced Jeff Gaspin as chairman of NBC Entertainment. In 2011, NBC was finally able to find a breakout hit in the midseason reality singing competition series \"The Voice\". Otherwise, NBC had another tough season, with every single new fall program getting cancelled by season's end – the third time this has happened to the network after the fall of 1975, and the fall of 1983 – and the midseason legal drama \"Harry's Law\" being its only freshman scripted series to be renewed for the 2011–12 season. The network nearly completed its full conversion to an all-HD schedule (outside of the Saturday morning time slot leased by the Qubo consortium, which NBCUniversal would rescind its stake in the following year) on September 20, 2011, when \"Last Call with Carson Daly\" converted to the format with the premiere of its 11th season.\n\nThe 2011–12 season was another tough season for NBC. On the upside, the network's broadcast of Super Bowl XLVI was the most-watched program in U.S. television history at the time, and the network's Monday night midseason lineup of \"The Voice\" and musical-drama \"Smash\" was very successful. The network managed to lift itself into third place in the 18–49 demographic in the 2011–12 season, primarily on the strength of those three programs (SNF, The Voice, and Smash), breaking the network's eight-year streak in fourth place. Four shows survived for a second season, but three of them were cancelled in the following year, none were unqualified ratings successes, and the network remained a distant fourth place in total viewership.\n\nIn the fall of 2012, NBC greatly expanded its sitcom roster, with eight comedy series airing on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday nights. NBC bounced back to first place network in adults 18–49 that fall, boosted by the new season of \"The Voice\", the initial success of freshman drama \"Revolution\" and sitcom \"Go On\", and the continued strength of \"Sunday Night Football\". However, withholding the new season of \"The Voice\" and benching \"Revolution\" until late March, the network's midseason ratings suffered, falling to fifth place behind Spanish-language network Univision during the February sweeps period. The 2012–13 season ended with NBC finishing in third place overall, albeit by a narrow margin, with only three new shows, all dramas, surviving for a second season (\"Revolution\", \"Chicago Fire\" and \"Hannibal\").\n\nIn 2013, NBC Sports migrated its business and production operations (including NBCSN) to new facilities in Stamford, Connecticut. Production of the network's NFL pre-game show \"Football Night in America\" remained at the NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center (with production operations based in Studio 8G, while the program itself was broadcast in Studio 8H, the longtime home of \"Saturday Night Live\"), until it migrated to the Stamford facility in September 2014. Despite the failure of another highly advertised game show event, \"The Million Second Quiz\", the 2013–14 season was mostly successful for NBC due to the continued success of \"The Voice\", \"Chicago Fire\", \"Revolution\", \"Sunday Night Football\" and \"Grimm\". Along with new hits including \"The Blacklist\", \"Hannibal\" and \"Chicago PD\" and a significant ratings boost from its broadcast of the 2014 Winter Olympics, NBC became the #1 network in the coveted 18–49 demographic that season for the first time since 2003–04, when \"Friends\" ended. NBC also improved considerably in total viewership, finishing behind long-dominant CBS in second place for the season.\n\nThe 2014–15 season was something of a mixed bag for NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural \"The Mysteries of Laura\", being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially \"The Blacklist\" (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries \"The Slap\"). Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18–49 demographic and in second place overall.\n\nThe 2015–16 season was successful for NBC, with the successful launch of the new drama \"Blindspot\" premiering after \"The Voice\", then subsequently being renewed for a second season in November 2015. NBC also continued with the success with the \"Chicago\" franchise with launching its second spin-off \"Chicago Med\", which also received an early second season pick up in February 2016. Thursday nights continues to be a struggle for NBC, with continued success with the third season of \"The Blacklist\" brought the failed launch of \"Heroes Reborn\" which was cancelled in January 2016, and thriller \"The Player\", however NBC found success with police procedural \"Shades of Blue\" which improved the 10pm time slot and was renewed for a second season in February 2016. On the comedy side, NBC surprisingly found success in the new workplace sitcom \"Superstore\" which premiered as a \"preview\" after \"The Voice\" in November 2015, and officially launched in January 2016 which brought decent ratings for a new comedy without \"The Voice\" as a lead-in and which was subsequently renewed for a second season in February 2016.\n\nThe 2016–17 season brought more success for NBC with the premiere of Comedy-drama \"This Is Us\", which was well received by critics and ratings and was renewed for two additional seasons in January 2017. \"The Blacklist\" continued to bring in modest ratings, but it brought the failed launch of its spinoff \"\". NBC continued to grow the \"Chicago\" franchise with a third spinoff titled \"Chicago Justice\". On the comedy side, workplace sitcom \"Superstore\" continued success in its second season. The network launched new fantasy sitcom \"The Good Place\" following \"The Voice\" and brought in modest ratings and was renewed for a second season in January 2017. Another highlight of the 2016–17 season was \"The Wall\", which premiered to modest ratings and would air in the summer time period prior to the 2017–18 season.\n\n, NBC provides 87 hours of regularly scheduled network programming each week. The network provides 22 hours of prime time programming to affiliated stations Monday through Saturdays from 8:00–11:00 p.m. (7:00–10:00 p.m. in all other U.S. time zones) and Sundays from 7:00–11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time (6:00–10:00 p.m. in all other time zones).\n\nDaytime programming is also provided weekdays between 12:00 and 3:00 p.m. in the form of the one-hour weekday soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\" (the scheduling of the program varies depending on the station, although it is initially fed to affiliates at 1:00 p.m. Eastern). NBC News programming includes the morning news/interview program \"Today\" from 7:00–11:00 a.m. weekdays, 7:00–9:00 on Saturdays and 7:00–8:00 on Sundays; nightly editions of \"NBC Nightly News\" (whose weekend editions are occasionally subject to abbreviation or preemption due to sports telecasts overrunning into the program's time slot), the Sunday political talk show \"Meet the Press\", weekday early-morning news program \"Early Today\" and newsmagazine \"Dateline NBC\". Late nights feature the weeknight talk shows \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\", \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" and \"A Little Late with Lilly Singh\", and an overnight replay \"Today with Hoda & Jenna\", or for NBC affiliates carrying it in syndication, the option to substitute a same-day encore of \"The Kelly Clarkson Show\". On Saturdays, the LXTV-produced \"1st Look\" and \"Open House NYC\" air after \"Saturday Night Live\" (replays of the previous week's \"1st Look\" also air on Friday late nights on most stations), with a \"Meet the Press\" encore a part of its Sunday overnight schedule.\n\nThe network's Saturday morning children's programming time slot is programmed by Litton Entertainment under a time-lease agreement. The three-hour block of programming designed for 14–16 year-old teenage viewers is under the umbrella branding of \"The More You Know\", based on the network's long-time strand of internally-produced public service announcements of the same name. It premiered on October 8, 2016, giving Litton control of all but Fox's Saturday morning E/I programming among the five major broadcast networks.\n\nSports programming is also provided weekend afternoons at any time between 12:00 and 6:00 p.m. (9:00 a.m.-3:00 p.m., or tape-delayed in the Pacific Time Zone). Due to the unpredictable length of sporting events, NBC will occasionally pre-empt scheduled programs (more common with the weekend editions of \"NBC Nightly News\", and local and syndicated programs carried by its owned-and-operated stations and affiliates). NBC has also held the American broadcasting rights to the Summer Olympic Games since the 1988 games and the rights to the Winter Olympic Games since the 2002 games. Coverage of the Olympics on NBC have included pre-empting regularly scheduled programs during daytime, primetime, and late night.\n\nNews coverage has long been an important part of NBC's operations and public image, dating to the network's radio days. Notable NBC News productions past and present include \"Today\", \"NBC Nightly News\" (and its immediate predecessor, the \"Huntley-Brinkley Report\"), \"Meet the Press\" (which has the distinction of the longest continuously running program in the history of American television), \"Dateline NBC\", \"Early Today\", \"NBC News at Sunrise\", \"NBC Nightside\" and \"Rock Center with Brian Williams\".\n\nIn 1989, the news division began its expansion to cable with the launch of business news channel CNBC. The company eventually formed other cable news services including MSNBC (created in 1996 originally as a joint venture with Microsoft, which now features a mix of general news and political discussion programs with a liberal stance), and the 2008 acquisition of The Weather Channel in conjunction with Blackstone Group and Bain Capital. In addition, NBCSN (operated as part of the NBC Sports Group, and which became an NBC property through Comcast's acquisition of NBCUniversal) carries sports news content alongside sports event telecasts. Key anchors from NBC News are also used during NBC Sports coverage of the Olympic Games.\n\nNBC is currently the home to only one daytime program, the hour-long soap opera \"Days of Our Lives\", which has been broadcast on the network since 1965. Since NBC turned back an hour of its then two-hour daytime schedule to its affiliates as a result of the September 2007 expansion of \"Today\" to four hours, the network currently ties with The CW for the fewest daytime programming hours of any major broadcast television network.\n\nLong-running daytime dramas seen on NBC in the past include \"The Doctors\" (1963–1982), \"Another World\" (1964–1999), \"Santa Barbara\" (1984–1993), and \"Passions\" (1999–2007). NBC also aired the final 4½ years of \"Search for Tomorrow\" (1982–1986) after that series was initially cancelled by CBS, although many NBC affiliates did not clear the show during its tenure on the network. NBC has also aired numerous short-lived soap operas, including \"Generations\" (1989–1991), \"Sunset Beach\" (1997–1999), and the two \"Another World\" spin-offs, \"Somerset\" (1970–1976) and \"Texas\" (1980–1982).\n\nNotable daytime game shows that once aired on NBC include \"The Price Is Right\" (1956–1963), \"Concentration\" (1958–1973; and 1987–1991 as \"Classic Concentration\"), \"The Match Game\" (1962–1969), \"Let's Make a Deal\" (1963–1968 and 1990–1991, as well as a short-lived prime-time revival in 2003), \"Jeopardy!\" (1964–1975 and 1978–1979), \"The Hollywood Squares\" (1966–1980), \"Wheel of Fortune\" (1975–1989 and 1991), \"Password Plus/Super Password\" (1979–1982 and 1984–1989), \"Sale of the Century\" (1969–1973 and 1983–1989) and \"Scrabble\" (1984–1990 and 1993). The last game show ever to air as part of NBC's daytime schedule was the short-lived \"Caesars Challenge\", which ended in January 1994.\n\nNotable past daytime talk shows that have aired on NBC have included \"Home\" (1954–1957), \"The Ernie Kovacs Show\" (1955–1956), \"The Merv Griffin Show\" (1962–1963), \"Leeza\" (1994–1999) and \"Later Today\" (1999–2000).\n\nChildren's programming has played a part in NBC's programming since its initial roots in television. NBC's first major children's series, \"Howdy Doody\", debuted in 1947 and was one of the era's first breakthrough television shows. From the mid-1960s until 1992, the bulk of NBC's children's programming was composed of mainly animated programming including classic \"Looney Tunes\" and \"Woody Woodpecker\" shorts; reruns of primetime animated sitcoms such as \"The Flintstones\" and \"The Jetsons\"; foreign acquisitions like \"Astro Boy\" and \"Kimba the White Lion\"; animated adaptions of \"Punky Brewster\", \"ALF\" and \"Star Trek\" as well as animated vehicles for Gary Coleman and Mr. T; live-action programs like \"The Banana Splits\", \"The Bugaloos\" and \"H.R. Pufnstuf\"; and the original broadcasts of \"Gumby\", \"The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show\", \"Underdog\", \"The Smurfs\", \"Alvin and the Chipmunks\" and \"Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears\". From 1984 to 1989, the network aired a series of public service announcements called \"One to Grow On\", which aired after the end credits of every program or every other children's program.\n\nIn 1989, NBC premiered \"Saved by the Bell\", a live-action teen sitcom which originated on The Disney Channel the previous year as \"Good Morning, Miss Bliss\" (which served as a starring vehicle for Hayley Mills; four cast members from that show were cast in the NBC series as the characters they originally played on \"Miss Bliss\"). \"Saved by the Bell\", despite being given bad reviews from television critics, would become one of the most popular teen series in television history as well as the top-rated series on Saturday mornings, dethroning ABC's \"The Bugs Bunny and Tweety Show\" in its first season.\n\nThe success of \"Saved by the Bell\" led NBC to remove animated series from its Saturday morning lineup in August 1992 in favor of additional live-action series as part of a new block called TNBC, along with the debut of a Saturday edition of \"Today\". Most of the series featured on the TNBC lineup were executive produced by Peter Engel (such as \"City Guys\", \"Hang Time\", \"California Dreams\", \"One World\" and the \"Saved by the Bell\" sequel, \"\"), with the lineup being designed from the start to meet the earliest form of the FCC's educational programming guidelines under the Children's Television Act. \"NBA Inside Stuff\", an analysis and interview program aimed at teens that was hosted for most of its run by Ahmad Rashād, was also a part of the TNBC lineup during the NBA season until 2002 (when the program moved to ABC as a result of that network taking the NBA rights from NBC).\n\nIn 2002, NBC entered into an agreement with Discovery Communications to carry educational children's programs from the Discovery Kids cable channel. Debuting that September, the Discovery Kids on NBC block originally consisted exclusively of live-action series, including reality series \"Trading Spaces: Boys vs. Girls\" (a kid-themed version of the TLC series \"Trading Spaces\"); the Emmy-nominated reality game show \"Endurance\", hosted and produced by J. D. Roth (whose production company, 3-Ball Productions, would also produce reality series \"The Biggest Loser\" for NBC beginning in 2003); and scripted series such as \"Strange Days at Blake Holsey High\" and \"Scout's Safari\". The block later expanded to include some animated series such as \"Kenny the Shark\", \"Tutenstein\" and \"Time Warp Trio\".\n\nIn May 2006, NBC announced plans to launch a new Saturday morning children's block under the Qubo brand in September 2006. An endeavor originally operated as a joint venture between NBCUniversal, Ion Media Networks, Scholastic Press, Classic Media and Corus Entertainment's Nelvana unit (Ion acquired the other partners' shares in 2013), the Qubo venture also encompassed weekly blocks on Telemundo and Ion Television, a 24-hour digital multicast network on Ion's owned-and-operated and affiliated stations, as well as video on demand services and a branded website. Qubo launched on NBC on September 9, 2006 with six programs (\"VeggieTales\", \"Dragon\", \"VeggieTales Presents: 3-2-1 Penguins!\", \"Babar\", \"Jane and the Dragon\" and \"Jacob Two-Two\").\n\nOn March 28, 2012, it was announced that NBC would launch a new Saturday morning preschool block programmed by Sprout (originally jointly owned by NBCUniversal, PBS, Sesame Workshop and Apax Partners, with the former acquiring the other's interests later that year). The block, NBC Kids, premiered on July 7, 2012, replacing the \"Qubo on NBC\" block.\n\nNBC holds the broadcast rights to several annual specials and award show telecasts including the Golden Globe Awards and the Emmy Awards (which is rotated across all four major networks each year). Since 1952, NBC has served as the official U.S. broadcaster of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. CBS also carries unauthorized coverage of the Macy's parade as part of \"The Thanksgiving Day Parade on CBS\"; However, as NBC holds rights to the parade, it has exclusivity over the broadcast of Broadway and music performances appearing in the parade (CBS airs live performances separate from those seen in the parade as a result), and Macy's chose to reroute the parade in 2012 out of the view of CBS' cameras, although it continues to cover the parade. NBC began airing a same-day rebroadcast of the parade telecast in 2009 (replacing its annual Thanksgiving afternoon airing of \"Miracle on 34th Street\"). In 2007, NBC acquired the rights to the National Dog Show, which airs following the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade each year.\n\nThe network also broadcasts several live-action and animated specials during the Christmas holiday season, including the 2014 debuts \"How Murray Saved Christmas\" (an animated musical adaptation of the children's book of the same name) and \"\" (a stop-motion animated special based on the 2003 live-action film \"Elf\").\n\nSince 2013, the network has aired live musical adaptations with major stars in lead roles. Originally dismissed as a gimmick, they have proven to be ratings successes, as well as a nostalgic tribute to the early days of television. Past adaptations include:\n\nFrom 2003 to 2014, NBC also held rights to two of the three pageants organized by the Miss Universe Organization: the Miss Universe and Miss USA pageants (NBC also held rights to the Miss Teen USA pageant from 2003, when NBC also assumed rights to the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants as part of a deal brokered by Miss Universe Organization owner Donald Trump that gave the network half-ownership of the pageants, until 2007, when NBC declined to renew its contract to carry Miss Teen USA, effectively discontinuing televised broadcasts of that event). NBCUniversal relinquished the rights to Miss Universe and Miss USA on June 29, 2015, as part of its decision to cut business ties with Donald Trump and the Miss Universe Organization (which was half-owned by corporate parent NBCUniversal) in response to controversial remarks about Mexican immigrants made by Trump during the launch of his 2016 campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination.\n\nThrough the years, NBC has produced many in-house programs, in addition to airing content from other producers such as Revue Studios and its successor Universal Television. Notable in-house productions by NBC have included \"Get Smart\", \"Bonanza\", \"Little House on the Prairie\", \"Las Vegas\", \"Crossing Jordan\" and \"Law & Order\".\n\nNBC sold the distribution rights to programs it produced prior to that year to National Telefilm Associates in 1973; those rights are currently owned by CBS Paramount Television through Republic Pictures and Spelling Entertainment Group, although NBC still owns the copyrights to the episodes. As a result, NBC, in a way, now owns several other series aired on the network prior to 1973, such as \"Wagon Train\". NBC continues to own its entire library of programs produced after 1973, through corporate sister NBCUniversal Television Group (the successor to Universal Television).\n\nNBC has twelve owned-and-operated stations and current and pending affiliation agreements with 223 additional television stations encompassing 51 states, the District of Columbia, six U.S. possessions and two non-U.S. territories (Aruba and Bermuda). The network has a national reach of 88.91% of all households in the United States (or 277,821,345 Americans with at least one television set).\n\nCurrently, New Jersey is the only U.S. state where NBC does not have a locally licensed affiliate. New Jersey is served by New York City O&O WNBC-TV and Philadelphia O&O WCAU; New Jersey formerly had an in-state affiliate in Atlantic City-based WMGM-TV, which was affiliated with the network from 1955 to 2014. NBC maintains affiliations with low-power stations (broadcasting either in analog or digital) in a few smaller markets, such as Binghamton, New York (WBGH-CD), Jackson, Tennessee (WNBJ-LD) and Juneau, Alaska (KATH-LD), that do not have enough full-power stations to support a standalone affiliate. In some markets, these stations also maintain digital simulcasts on a subchannel of a co-owned/co-managed full-power television station.\n\nPortions of New Hampshire receive NBC programming via network-owned WBTS-CD, licensed to serve Nashua; while nominally licensed as a low-power class A station, it transmits a full-power signal under a channel share with the WGBH Educational Foundation and its secondary Boston station WGBX-TV from Needham, Massachusetts, and serves as the NBC station for the entire Boston market. Until 2019, NBC operated a low-powered station in Boston, WBTS-LD (now WYCN-LD), which aimed to serve as its station in that market while using a network of additional full-power stations to cover the market in full (including Merrimack, New Hampshire-licensed Telemundo station WNEU, which transmitted WBTS on a second subchannel); NBC purchased the Nashua station (formerly WYCN-CD) in early 2018 after the FCC spectrum auction, and in 2019 relocated WYCN-LD to Providence, Rhode Island to serve as a Telemundo station for that market.\n\nCurrently outside of the NBC Owned Television Stations-operated O&O group, Tegna Media is the largest operator of NBC stations in terms of overall market reach, owning or providing services to 20 NBC affiliates (including those in larger markets such as Denver, St. Louis, Seattle and Cleveland); Gray Television is the largest operator of NBC stations by numerical total, owning 23 NBC-affiliated stations.\n\nNBC provides video on demand access for delayed viewing of the network's programming through various means, including via its website at NBC.com, a traditional VOD service called NBC on Demand available on most traditional cable and IPTV providers, and through content deals with Hulu and Netflix (the latter of which carries only cataloged episodes of NBC programs, after losing the right to carry newer episodes of its programs during their current seasons in July 2011). NBCUniversal is a part-owner of Hulu (along with majority owner The Walt Disney Company, owner of ABC), and has offered full-length episodes of most of NBC's programming through the streaming service (which are available for viewing on Hulu's website and mobile app) since Hulu launched in private beta testing on October 29, 2007.\n\nThe most recent episodes of the network's shows are usually made available on NBC.com and Hulu the day after their original broadcast. In addition, NBC.com and certain other partner websites (including Hulu) provide complete back catalogs of most of its current series as well as a limited selection of episodes of classic series from the NBCUniversal Television Distribution program library – including shows not broadcast by NBC during their original runs (including the complete or partial episode catalogs of shows like \"30 Rock\", \"The A-Team\", \"Charles in Charge\", \"Emergency!\", \"Knight Rider\" (both the original series and the short-lived 2008 reboot), \"Kojak\", \"Miami Vice\", \"The Office\", \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Simon & Simon\").\n\nOn February 18, 2015, NBC began providing live programming streams of local NBC stations in select markets, which are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers. All eleven NBC owned-and-operated stations owned by NBCUniversal Owned Television Stations' were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on NBC's website and mobile app, with intentions to reach agreements with other station groups to provide streams of NBC-affiliated stations in other markets. Due to restrictions imposed by the league, the network's NFL game telecasts are not permitted to be streamed on the service.\n\nNBC's master feed is transmitted in 1080i high definition, the native resolution format for NBCUniversal's television properties. However, 19 of its affiliates transmit the network's programming in 720p HD, while four others carry the network feed in 480i standard definition either due to technical considerations for affiliates of other major networks that carry NBC programming on a digital subchannel, or because a primary feed NBC affiliate has not yet upgraded their transmission equipment to allow content to be presented in HD.\n\nWRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina (a station that re-joined NBC in February 2016) is currently testing the upcoming ATSC 3.0 television standard, which will allow the transmission of 2160p ultra-high-definition television (UHD), through a secondary experimental station (WRAL-EX); it has transmitted limited NBC programming in UHD through a secondary subchannel, and is currently the only station overall which transmits NBC's schedule in 1080p on its main subchannel.\n\n\"Meet the Press\" was the first regular series on a major television network to produce a high-definition broadcast on February 2, 1997, which aired in the format over WHD-TV in Washington, D.C., an experimental television station owned by a consortium of industry groups and stations which launched to allow testing of HD broadcasts and operated until 2002 (the program itself continued to be transmitted in 480i standard definition over the NBC network until May 2, 2010, when it became the last NBC News program to convert to HD). NBC officially began its conversion to high definition with the launch of its simulcast feed, NBC HD, on April 26, 1999, when \"The Tonight Show\" became the first HD program to air on the NBC network as well as the first regularly scheduled American network program to be produced and transmitted in high definition. The network gradually converted much of its existing programming from standard-definition to high definition beginning with the 2002–03 season, with select shows among that season's slate of freshmen scripted series being broadcast in HD from their debuts.\n\nThe network completed its conversion to high definition in September 2012, with the launch of NBC Kids, a new Saturday morning children's block programmed by new partial sister network PBS Kids Sprout, which also became the second Saturday morning children's block with an entirely HD schedule (after the ABC-syndicated \"Litton's Weekend Adventure\"). All of the network's programming has been presented in full HD since then (with the exception of certain holiday specials produced prior to 2005 – such as its annual broadcast of \"It's a Wonderful Life\" – which continue to be presented in 4:3 SD, although some have been remastered for HD broadcast).\n\nIn 1999, NBC launched NBCi (briefly changing its web address to \"www.nbci.com\"), a heavily advertised online venture serving as an attempt to launch an Internet portal and homepage. This move saw NBC partner with XOOM.com (not to be confused with the current money transfer service), e-mail.com, AllBusiness.com, and Snap.com (eventually acquiring all four companies outright; Snap should also not be confused with the current-day parent of Snapchat) to launch a multi-faceted internet portal with e-mail, webhosting, community, chat and personalization capabilities, and news content. Subsequently, in April 2000, NBC purchased GlobalBrain, a company specializing in search engines that learned from searches initiated by its users, for $32 million.\n\nThe experiment lasted roughly one season; after its failure, NBCi's operations were folded back into NBC. The NBC Television portion of the website reverted to NBC.com. However, the NBCi website continued in operation as a portal for NBC-branded content (NBCi.com would be redirected to NBCi.msnbc.com), using a co-branded version of InfoSpace to deliver minimal portal content. In mid-2007, NBCi.com began to mirror the main NBC.com website; NBCi.com was eventually redirected to the NBC.com domain in 2010.\n\nNBC has used a number of logos throughout its history; early logos used by the television and radio networks were similar to the logo of its then parent company, RCA. Logos used later in NBC's existence incorporated stylized peacock designs, including the current version that has been in use since 1986.\n\nNBC network programs can be received throughout most of Canada on cable, satellite and IPTV providers through certain U.S.-based affiliates of the network (such as WBTS-CD in Boston, KING-TV in Seattle, KBJR-TV in Duluth, Minnesota, WGRZ in Buffalo, New York and WDIV-TV in Detroit). Some programs carried on these stations are subject to simultaneous substitutions, a practice imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission in which a pay television provider supplants an American station's signal with a feed from a Canadian station/network airing a particular program in the same time slot to protect domestic advertising revenue. Some of these affiliates are also receivable over-the-air in southern areas of the country located near the Canada–United States border (signal coverage was somewhat reduced after the digital television transition in 2009 due to the lower radiated power required to transmit digital signals).\n\nNBC no longer exists outside the Americas as a channel in its own right. However, NBC News and MSNBC programs are broadcast for a few hours a day on OSN News, formerly known as Orbit News in Africa and the Middle East. Sister network CNBC Europe also broadcasts occasional breaking news coverage from MSNBC as well as \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\". CNBC Europe also broadcast daily airings of \"NBC Nightly News\" at 00:30 CET Monday to Fridays.\n\nIn 1993, then-NBC parent General Electric acquired Super Channel, relaunching the Pan-European cable network as NBC Super Channel. In 1996, the channel was renamed NBC Europe, but was, from then on, almost always referred to on-air as simply \"NBC\".\n\nMost of NBC Europe's prime time programming was produced in Europe due to rights restrictions associated with U.S. primetime shows; the channel's weekday late night schedule after 11:00 p.m. Central European Time, however, featured \"The Tonight Show\", \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\" and \"Later\", which the channel's slogan \"Where the Stars Come Out at Night\" was based around. Many NBC News programs were broadcast on NBC Europe, including \"Dateline NBC\", \"Meet the Press\" and \"NBC Nightly News\", the latter of which was broadcast simultaneously with the initial U.S. telecast. \"Today\" was also initially aired live in the afternoons, but was later broadcast instead the following morning on a more than half-day delay.\n\nIn 1999, NBC Europe ceased broadcasting in most of Europe outside of Germany; the network was concurrently relaunched as a German-language technology channel aimed at a younger demographic, with the new series \"NBC GIGA\" as its flagship program. In 2005, the channel was relaunched again as the free-to-air movie channel Das Vierte which eventually shut down end of 2013 (acquired by Disney which replaced it by a German version of Disney Channel. GIGA Television was subsequently spun off as a separate digital channel, available on satellite and cable providers in Germany, Austria and Switzerland which shut down as a TV-station end of 2009.\n\nNBC programming is available in Mexico through free-to-air affiliates in markets located within proximity to the Mexico–United States border (such as KYMA-DT/Yuma, Arizona; KGNS-TV/Laredo, Texas; KTSM/El Paso, Texas; KVEO/Brownsville, Texas; and KNSD/San Diego), whose signals are readily receivable over-the-air in border areas of northern Mexico. Some U.S.-based border affiliates are also available on subscription television providers throughout the country, including in the Mexico City area.\n\nIn Nicaragua, satellite providers carry either select U.S.-based NBC and Telemundo affiliated stations or the main network feed from NBCUniversal or Telemundo. The main local affiliate stations are NBC 6 WTVJ, Telemundo 51 WSCV in Miami. In addition to the NBC programming there is also available by the NBC sister network Telemundo, a Spanish network based in the United States.\n\nIn 1993, NBC launched a 24-hour Spanish-language news channel serving Latin America (the second news channel serving that region overall, after Noticias ECO, and the first to broadcast 24 hours a day), Canal de Noticias NBC, which based its news schedule around the \"wheel\" format conceived at CNN. The channel, which was headquartered in the offices of the NBC News Channel affiliate news service in Charlotte, North Carolina, employed over 50 journalists to produce, write, anchor and provide technical services. Canal de Noticias NBC shut down in 1999 due to the channel's inability to generate sustainable advertising revenue.\n\nIn the Caribbean, many subscription providers carry either select U.S.-based NBC affiliated stations or the main network feed from NBC O&Os WNBC in New York City or WTVJ in Miami. In addition, the network's programming has been available in the U.S. Virgin Islands since 2004 on WVGN-LD in Charlotte Amalie (owned by LKK Group), while Telemundo owned-and-operated station WKAQ-TV in San Juan, Puerto Rico carries the WNBC feed on a digital subchannel. In these areas, NBC programs are available in English and in Spanish via second audio program.\n\nIn the Bahamas, NBC programming is available via U.S.-based affiliate stations on domestic cable providers.\n\nIn Aruba, NBC maintains an affiliation with Oranjestad station PJA-TV (which brands on-air as \"ATV\").\n\nIn Puerto Rico, Telemundo O&O WKAQ-TV carries \"NBC Puerto Rico\" over their third subchannel, which is effectively a simulcast of WNBC with some local advertising and station identification.\n\nUntil it ended operations in 2014, NBC's entire program lineup was carried by VSB-TV, using the Eastern Time Zone feed, though an hour ahead due to its location in the Atlantic Time Zone. Bermuda currently receives NBC service from WTVJ Miami via cable.\n\nIn Guam, the entire NBC programming lineup is carried by Hagåtña affiliate KUAM-TV (which has been an NBC affiliate since 1956) via the network's East Coast satellite feed. Entertainment and news programming is broadcast day and date on a one-day tape delay as Guam is on the west side of the International Date Line (for example, the network's Thursday prime time lineup airs Friday evenings on KUAM, and is advertised by the station as airing on the latter night in on-air promotions). Live programming, including breaking news and sporting events, airs as scheduled; because of the time difference with the six U.S. time zones, live sports coverage often airs on the station early in the morning. KUAM's programming is relayed to the Northern Mariana Islands via satellite station WSZE in Saipan.\n\nIn American Samoa, NBC was affiliated with KKHJ-LP in Pago Pago from 2005 to 2012. Cable television providers on the islands carry the network's programming via Seattle affiliate KING-TV.\n\nIn the Federated States of Micronesia, NBC programming is available on domestic cable providers via Honolulu affiliate KHNL.\n\nNBC Asia launched in 1994, distributed to Nepal, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Pakistan and the Philippines. Like NBC Europe, NBC Asia featured most of NBC's news programs as well as \"The Tonight Show\", \"Late Night\" and \"Saturday Night Live\". Like its European counterpart, it was not allowed to broadcast American-produced primetime shows due to existing broadcast agreements with other domestic broadcasters. NBC Asia produced a regional evening news program that aired each weeknight, and occasionally simulcast some programs from CNBC Asia and MSNBC. NBC also operated NBC Super Sports, a 24-hour channel devoted to televising sporting events.\n\nIn July 1998, NBC Asia was replaced by a regional version of the National Geographic Channel. As is the case with NBC Europe, CNBC Asia broadcasts select episodes of \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Late Night\" as well as \"Meet the Press\" are as part of its weekend schedule, and airs NFL games under the \"Sunday Night Football\" brand.\n\nThrough regional partners, NBC-produced programs are seen in some countries in the continent. In the Philippines, Jack TV (owned by Solar Entertainment) airs \"Will & Grace\" and \"Saturday Night Live\", while TalkTV airs \"The Tonight Show\" and NBC News programs including the weekday and weekend editions of \"Today\", \"Early Today\", \"Dateline NBC\" and \"NBC Nightly News\". Solar TV formerly broadcast \"The Jay Leno Show\" from 2009 to 2010. In Hong Kong, English language free-to-air channel TVB Pearl (operated by TVB) airs live broadcasts of \"NBC Nightly News\", as well as other select NBC programs.\n\nIn Australia, the Seven Network has maintained close ties with NBC and has used a majority of the U.S. network's image campaigns and slogans since the 1970s (conversely, in 2009, NBC and Seven both used the Guy Sebastian single \"Like it Like That\" in image promos for their respective summer schedules). The network's \"Seven News\" division has used John Williams-composed \"The Mission\" (the proprietary theme music for NBC News' flagship programs since 1985) as the theme music for its local and national news programs since the mid-1980s, though re-composed domestically to meet their own branding image. Local newscasts were also titled \"Seven Nightly News\" from the mid-1980s until c. 2000. NBC News and Seven News often share news resources, with the former division using Seven's reporters for breaking news coverage and select taped story packages relating to Australian stories and the latter sometimes incorporating NBC News reports into its national bulletins.\n\nSeven also rebroadcasts some of NBC's news and current affairs programming during the early morning hours (usually from 3:00 to 5:00 a.m. local time), including the weekday and weekend editions of \"Today\" (which it brands as \"NBC Today\" to differentiate it from the unrelated morning program of the same title on the Nine Network), \"Dateline NBC\" and \"Meet the Press\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29697498", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29697498", "title": "PBS", "text": "PBS\n\nThe Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) is an American public broadcaster and television program distributor. It is a nonprofit organization and the most prominent provider of educational television programming to public television stations in the United States, distributing series such as \"American Experience\", \"America's Test Kitchen\", \"Antiques Roadshow\", \"Arthur\", \"Barney & Friends\", \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\", \"Downton Abbey\", \"Finding Your Roots\", \"Frontline\", \"The Magic School Bus\", \"Masterpiece\", \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", \"Nature\", \"Nova\", the \"PBS NewsHour\", \"Reading Rainbow\", \"Sesame Street\", \"Teletubbies\", and \"This Old House\".\n\nPBS is funded by a combination of member station dues, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, National Datacast, pledge drives, and donations from both private foundations and individual citizens. All proposed funding for programming is subject to a set of standards to ensure the program is free of influence from the funding source.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, Roper Opinion Research polls commissioned by PBS have consistently placed the service as the \"most-trusted national institution\" in the United States. A 20162017 study by Nielsen Media Research found 80% of all US television households view the network's programs over the course of a year. However, PBS is not responsible for all programming carried on public television stations, a large proportion of which may come from its member stations, including WGBH-TV, WETA-TV, WNET, WTTW, WHYY-TV, Twin Cities PBS, American Public Television, and independent producers. This distinction regarding the origin of different programs on the service present a frequent source of viewer confusion.\n\nPBS has more than 350 member television stations, many owned by educational institutions, nonprofit groups both independent or affiliated with one particular local public school district or collegiate educational institution, or entities owned by or related to state government.\n\nEstablished on November 3, 1969 by Hartford N. Gunn Jr. (president of WGBH), John Macy (president of CPB), James Day (last president of National Educational Television), and Kenneth A. Christiansen (chairman of the department of broadcasting at the University of Florida),\n\nPBS began operations on October 5, 1970, taking over many of the functions of its predecessor, National Educational Television (NET), which later merged with Newark, New Jersey station WNDT to form WNET. In 1973, it merged with Educational Television Stations.\n\nFollowing public disclosure of the Watergate scandal, on May 17, 1973, the United States Senate Watergate Committee commenced proceedings; PBS broadcast the proceedings nationwide, with Robert MacNeil and Jim Lehrer as commentators. For seven months, nightly \"gavel-to-gavel\" broadcasts drew great public interest, and raised the profile of the fledgling PBS network.\n\nUnlike the five major commercial broadcast television networks in the United States, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and The CW, PBS is technically not a network but a program distributor that provides television content and related services to its member stations. Each station is charged with the responsibility of programming local content such as news, interviews, cultural and public affairs programs for their individual market or state that supplements content provided by PBS and other public television distributors.\n\nIn a television network structure, affiliates give up portions of their local advertising airtime in exchange for carrying network programming, and the network pays its affiliates a share of the revenue it earns from advertising. By contrast, PBS member stations pay fees for the shows acquired and distributed by the national organization. Under this relationship, PBS member stations have greater latitude in local scheduling than their commercial broadcasting counterparts. Scheduling of PBS-distributed series may vary greatly depending on the market. This can be a source of tension as stations seek to preserve their localism, and PBS strives to market a consistent national lineup. However, PBS has a policy of \"common carriage\", which requires most stations to clear the national prime time programs on a common programming schedule to market them nationally more effectively. Management at former Los Angeles member KCET cited unresolvable financial and programming disputes among its major reasons for leaving PBS after over 40 years in January 2011, although it would return to PBS in 2019.\n\nAlthough PBS has a set schedule of programming, particularly in regard to its prime time schedule, member stations reserve the right to schedule PBS-distributed programming in other time slots or not clear it at all if they choose to do so; few of the service's members carry all its programming. Most PBS stations timeshift some distributed programs. Once PBS accepts a program offered for distribution, PBS, rather than the originating member station, retains exclusive rebroadcasting rights during an agreed period. Suppliers retain the right to sell the program in non-broadcast media such as DVDs, books, and sometimes PBS licensed merchandise.\n\nIn 1991, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting resumed funding for most PBS shows that debuted prior to 1977, with the exceptions of \"Washington Week in Review\" and \"Wall Street Week\" (CPB resumed funding of \"Washington Week\" in 1997).\n\nIn 1994, \"The Chronicle of Philanthropy\" released the results of the largest study on the popularity and credibility of charitable and non-profit organizations. PBS ranked as the 11th \"most popular charity/non-profit in America\" from over 100 charities researched in the study conducted by the industry publication, with 38.2% of Americans over the age of 12 choosing \"love\" and \"like a lot\" for PBS.\n\nIn December 2009, PBS signed up for the Nielsen ratings audience measurement reports, and began to be included in its primetime and daily \"Television Index\" reports, alongside the major commercial broadcast networks. In May 2011, PBS announced that it would incorporate breaks containing underwriter spots for corporate and foundation sponsors, program promotions and identification spots within four breaks placed within episodes of \"Nature\" and \"NOVA\", airing episodes broken up into segments of up to 15 minutes, rather than airing them as straight 50- to 55-minute episodes. The strategy began that fall, with the intent to expand the in-program breaks to the remainder of the schedule if successful.\n\nIn 2011, PBS released apps for iOS and Android to allow viewing of full-length videos on mobile devices. An update in 2015 added Chromecast support.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, PBS partnered with AOL to launch \"\", a digital documentary series focusing on high-achieving women in male-dominated industries such as war, comedy, space, business, Hollywood and politics.\n\nPBS initially struggled to compete with online media such as YouTube for market share. In a 2012 speech to 850 top executives from PBS stations, Senior Vice President of Digital Jason Seiken warned that PBS was in danger of being disrupted by YouTube studios such as Maker Studios. In the speech, later described as a \"seminal moment\" for public television, he laid out his vision for a new style of PBS digital video production. Station leadership rallied around his vision and Seiken formed PBS Digital Studios, which began producing educational but edgy videos, something Seiken called \"PBS-quality with a YouTube sensibility\". The studio's first hit, an auto-tuned version of the theme from one of their most famous television programs, \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\", was one of YouTube's 10 most viral videos of 2012. By 2013, monthly video views on PBS.org had risen from 2 million to a quarter-billion, PBS.org traffic had surpassed that of the CBS, NBC, and ABC web sites, PBSKids.org had become the dominant US children's site for video, and PBS had won more 2013 Webby Awards than any other media company in the world.\n\nOn May 8, 2013, full-length episodes of PBS' prime time, news and children's programs were made available through the Roku streaming player; programming is available on Roku as separate streaming channels for PBS and PBS Kids content. Some content is only available with a PBS Passport member benefit subscription.\n\nThe evening and primetime schedule on PBS features a diverse array of programming including fine arts (\"Great Performances\"); drama (\"Masterpiece\", \"Downton Abbey\", \"American Family: Journey of Dreams\"); science (\"Nova\", \"Nature\"); history (\"American Experience\", \"American Masters\", \"History Detectives\", \"Antiques Roadshow\"); music (\"Austin City Limits\", \"Soundstage\"); public affairs (\"Frontline\", \"PBS NewsHour\", \"Washington Week\", Nightly Business Report); independent films and documentaries (\"P.O.V.\", \"Independent Lens\"); home improvement (\"This Old House\"); and interviews (\"Amanpour & Company\", \"Tavis Smiley\", \"The Dick Cavett Show\"). In 2012, PBS began organizing much of its prime time programming around a genre-based schedule (for example, drama series encompass the Sunday schedule, while science-related programs are featured on Wednesdays).\n\nPBS broadcasts children's programming as part of the service's (and including content supplied by other distributors not programmed by the service, its member stations') morning and afternoon schedule. As the children's programs it distributes are intended to educate as well as entertain its target audience, PBS and its stations have long been in compliance with educational programming guidelines set by the Federal Communications Commission in response to the enactment of the Children's Television Act of 1990. Many member stations have historically also broadcast distance education and other instructional television programs, typically during daytime slots; though with the advent of digital television, which has allowed stations to carry these programs on digital subchannels in lieu of the main PBS feed or exclusively over the Internet, many member stations/networks have replaced distance education content with children's and other programming.\n\nUnlike its radio counterpart, National Public Radio, PBS does not have a central program production arm or news division. All of the programming carried by PBS, whether news, documentary or entertainment, is created by (or in most cases produced under contract with) other parties, such as individual member stations. Boston member WGBH-TV is one of the largest producers of educational television programming, including shows like \"American Experience\", \"Arthur\", \"Masterpiece Theatre\", \"Nova\", \"Antiques Roadshow\" and \"Frontline\", as well as many other children's and lifestyle programs. News programs are produced by WETA-TV (\"PBS Newshour\") in Washington, D.C., WNET in New York City and WPBT in Miami. Newark, New Jersey/New York City member WNET produces or distributes programs such as \"Secrets of the Dead\", \"Nature,\" and \"Cyberchase\". PBS also works with other networks for programming such as CNN International for \"Amanpour & Company\" which is a co-production of CNN International and WNET.\n\nPBS member stations are known for rebroadcasting British television costume dramas, comedies and science fiction programs (acquired from the BBC and other sources) such as \"Downton Abbey\"; \"'Allo 'Allo!\"; \"Are You Being Served?\"; \"The Benny Hill Show\", \"Red Dwarf\"; \"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin\"; \"Father Ted\"; \"Fawlty Towers\"; \"Harry Enfield and Chums\"; \"Keeping Up Appearances\"; \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\"; \"Mr. Bean\", \"The Vicar of Dibley\", \"Doctor Who\", and \"Sherlock\"; consequently, this has led to jocular references that the service's name stands for \"Primarily British Series\". However, a significant amount of sharing takes place. The BBC and British broadcasters such as Channel 4 often cooperate with PBS stations, producing material that is shown on both sides of the Atlantic. Less frequently, Canadian, Australian and other international programming appears on PBS stations (such as \"The Red Green Show\", currently distributed by syndicator Executive Program Services); public broadcasting syndicators are more likely to offer this programming to U.S.-based public television stations.\n\nPBS is not the only distributor of public television programming to the member stations. Other distributors have emerged from the roots of companies that maintained loosely held regional public television stations in the 1960s. Boston-based American Public Television (which, among other names, was formerly known as Eastern Educational Network and the American Program Service) is second only to PBS for distributing programs to U.S. non-commercial stations. Another distributor is NETA (formerly SECA), whose properties have included \"The Shapies\" and \"Jerry Yarnell School of Fine Art\". In addition, the member stations themselves also produce a variety of local shows, some of which subsequently receive national distribution through PBS or other distributors.\n\nRerun programming, especially domestic programming not originally produced for public television, is generally uncommon on PBS or its member stations. The most prominent exception to this is \"The Lawrence Welk Show\", which has aired continuously in reruns on PBS (through the Oklahoma Educational Television Authority) almost every weekend since 1986. Reruns of programs originally produced for public television are common, especially with former PBS shows whose hosts have retired or died (for example, \"The Joy of Painting\" and \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood\"). Children's programming (such as \"Clifford the Big Red Dog\" and \"DragonflyTV\", the latter of which is also syndicated on commercial television) is rerun extensively.\n\nLaunched as PTV on July 11, 1994, PBS Kids is the brand for children's programs aired by PBS. The PBS Kids network, launched in 1999 and operated until 2005, was largely funded by satellite provider DirecTV. The channel ceased operations on September 26, 2005, in favor of PBS Kids Sprout, a commercial digital cable and satellite television channel originally operated as a joint venture with Comcast, Sesame Workshop and Apax Partners (NBCUniversal, which Comcast acquired in 2011, later acquired the other partners' interests in the channel in 2012). However, the original programming block still exists on PBS, filling daytime and in some cases, weekend morning schedules on its member stations; many members also carry 24-hour locally programmed children's networks featuring PBS Kids content on one of their digital subchannels. As of 2019, PBS Kids is the only children's programming block on U.S. broadcast television.\n\nAs PBS is often known for doing, PBS Kids has broadcast imported series from other countries; these include British series originally broadcast by the BBC and ITV. Through American Public Television, many PBS stations also began airing the Australian series \"Raggs\" on June 4, 2007. Some of the programs broadcast as part of the service's children's lineup or through public broadcast syndication directly to its members have subsequently been syndicated to commercial television outlets (such as \"Ghostwriter\" and \"The Magic School Bus\").\n\nMany PBS member stations and networks – including Mississippi Public Broadcasting (MHSAA), Georgia Public Broadcasting (GHSA), Maine Public Broadcasting Network (MPA), Iowa Public Television (IGHSAU), Nebraska Educational Telecommunications (NSAA), and WKYU-TV (Western Kentucky Hilltoppers) – locally broadcast high school and college sports. From the 1980s onward, the national PBS network has not typically carried sporting events, mainly because the broadcast rights to most sporting events have become more cost-prohibitive in that timeframe, especially for nonprofits with limited revenue potential; in addition, starting with the respective launches of the MountainWest Sports Network (now defunct) and Big Ten Network in 2006 and 2007 and the later launches of the Pac-12 Network and ESPN's SEC Network and ACC Network, athletic conferences have acquired rights for all of their member university's sports programs for their cable channels, restricting their use from PBS member stations, even those associated with their own universities.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1989, KQED produced a series of Bundesliga matches under the banner \"Soccer Made in Germany\", with Toby Charles announcing. PBS also carried tennis events, as well as Ivy League football. Notable football commentators included Upton Bell, Marty Glickman, Bob Casciola, Brian Dowling, Sean McDonough and Jack Corrigan. Other sports programs included interview series such as \"The Way It Was\" and \"The Sporting Life\".\n\nThe board of directors is responsible for governing and setting policy for PBS, consisting of 27 members: 14 professional directors (station managers), 12 general directors (outside directors), and the PBS president. All PBS Board members serve three-year terms, without pay. PBS member stations elect the 14 professional directors; the board elects the 12 general directors and appoints the PBS president and CEO; and the entire board elects its officers.\n\n, PBS maintains current memberships with 354 television stations encompassing 50 states, the District of Columbia and four U.S. possessions; as such, it is the only television broadcaster in the United States – commercial or non-commercial – which has station partners licensed in every U.S. state (by comparison, none of the five major commercial broadcast networks has affiliates in certain states where PBS has members, most notably New Jersey). The service has an estimated national reach of 93.74% of all households in the United States (or 292,926,047 Americans with at least one television set).\n\nPBS stations are commonly operated by nonprofit organizations, state agencies, local authorities (such as municipal boards of education), or universities in their city of license; this is similar (albeit more centralized in states where a licensee owns multiple stations rebroadcasting the main PBS member) to the early model of commercial broadcasting in the U.S., in which network-affiliated stations were initially owned by companies that owned few to no other television stations elsewhere in the country. In some U.S. states, a group of PBS stations throughout the entire state may be organized into a single regional \"subnetwork\" (such as Alabama Public Television and the Arkansas Educational Television Network); in this model, PBS programming and other content is distributed by the originating station in the subnetwork to other full-power stations that serve as satellites as well as any low-power translators in other areas of the state. Some states may be served by such a regional network and simultaneously have PBS member stations in a certain city (such as the case with secondary member KBDI-TV in Denver, which is not related to Colorado member network Rocky Mountain PBS and its flagship station and primary Denver PBS member, KRMA-TV) that operate autonomously from the regional member network.\n\nAs opposed to the present commercial broadcasting model in which network programs are often carried exclusively on one television station in a given market, PBS may maintain more than one member station in certain markets, which may be owned by the licensee of the market's primary PBS member station or owned by a separate licensee (as a prime example, KOCE-TV, KLCS and KVCR-DT – which are all individually owned – serve as PBS stations for the Los Angeles market; KCET served as the market's primary PBS member until it left the service in January 2011, at which time it was replaced by KOCE). KCET rejoined PBS in 2019, thus giving the Los Angeles area four different member stations.\n\nFor these cases, PBS utilizes the Program Differentiation Plan, which divides by percentage the amount of programs distributed by the service that each member can carry on their schedule; often, this assigns a larger proportion of PBS-distributed programming to the primary member station, with the secondary members being allowed to carry a lesser amount of program offerings from the service's schedule. Unlike public broadcasters in most other countries, PBS cannot own any of the stations that broadcasts its programming; therefore it is one of the few television programming bodies that does not have any owned-and-operated stations. This is partly due to the origins of the PBS stations themselves, and partly due to historical broadcast license issues.\n\nMost PBS member stations have produced at least some nationally distributed programs. Current regularly scheduled programming on the PBS national feed is produced by a smaller group of stations, including:\n\n\n\nPBS has spun off a number of television networks, often in partnership with other media companies. PBS YOU, a distance education and how-to service operated until January 2006, and was largely succeeded by Create (a similarly formatted network owned by American Public Television); PBS Kids Channel was superseded by Sprout at the start of October 2005. The PBS Kids Channel relaunched January 16, 2017. World began operations in 2007 as a service operated by PBS but is now managed by American Public Television.\n\nPBS has also restructured its satellite feed system, simplifying HD02 (PBS West) into a timeshift feed for the Pacific Time Zone, rather than a high-definition complement to its formerly primary SD feed. PBS Kids Go! was proposed as a replacement broadcast network for PBS Kids Channel, however, plans to launch the network were folded in 2006. Programming from the PBS Satellite Service has also been carried by certain member stations or regional member networks to fill their overnight schedules (particularly those that have transitioned to a 24-hour schedule since the late 1990s), in lieu of providing programming sourced from outside public television distributors or repeats of local programming (program promotions shown on the satellite feed advertise upcoming programs as being aired on PBS during the timeslot card normally used as a placeholder for member outlets to insert local airtime information).\n\nSome or all of these services are available on a digital cable tier of many cable providers, on a free-to-air (FTA) satellite receiver receiving from PBS Satellite Service, as well as via subscription-based direct broadcast satellite providers. With the exception of Sprout, some of these services, including those from PBS member stations and networks, have not made contracts with Internet-distributed over-the-top MVPD services such as PlayStation Vue and Sling TV. With the transition to over-the-air digital television broadcasts, many of the services are also often now available as standard-definition multicast channels on the digital signals of some member stations, while HD02 (PBS West) serves as a secondary HD feed. With the absence of advertising, network identification on these PBS networks was limited to utilization at the end of the program, which includes the standard series of bumpers from the \"Be More\" campaign.\n\nAt the summer 2019 Television Critics Association press tour day for PBS on July 29, 2019, it was announced that MVPD YouTube TV would begin to carry PBS programming and member stations in the fall of 2019. Member stations have the choice of having their traditional channel on the service with its full programming schedule received by Google over-the-air and uploaded to the service, a YouTube TV-only feed provided by the station with some programming substitutions due to lack of digital rights, or a PBS-provided feed with limited localization, though with no local programming or pledge drive programming.\n\nWhile not operated or controlled by PBS proper, additional public broadcasting networks are available and carried by PBS member stations.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2011, Buffalo, New York member station WNED-TV operated ThinkBright TV, a service that was carried on several stations in upstate New York. Several state networks also offer a public affairs subchannel network offering full-time coverage of state government events and legislative/judicial proceedings in the same vein as C-SPAN's coverage of the federal government.\n\nA separate but related concept is the state network, where a group of stations across a state simulcast a single programming schedule from a central facility, which may include specialty subchannels unique to that broadcaster.\n\nPBS introduced its first iconographic logo in 1971, a multi-colored wordmark of the network's initials with the P designed to resemble a silhouette of a human face. The logo was designed by Ernie Smith and Herb Lubalin of the Lubalin Smith Carnase design firm. Lubalin's human face \"P\", known internally at PBS as \"Everyman\", but more commonly known as the \"P-Head\", became the basis for all subsequent PBS logos.\n\nIn 1984, PBS introduced a new version of the logo, designed by Tom Geismar of Chermayeff & Geismar. Chermayeff & Geismar felt that the Lubalin-designed logo was too similar to those of the three dominant commercial networks of the time, and they sought \"to develop a symbol that could stand for the more inclusive concept of 'public television'\". They inverted Lubalin's Everyman \"P\" to face to the right instead of the left, and repeated the outline as a series to represent a \"multitude\" of people. The symbol was subsequently renamed \"Everyone\". The repeated outline of the face has also been interpreted to suggest a degree of multiculturalism, as well as the public service aspect of the PBS mission. \n\nThe logo has been used in various forms since: from 1998 onward, the Geismar logo has been rendered in white on a circle. On November 4, 2019, in honor of the network's 50th anniversary, PBS unveiled a redesign of its identity by Lippincott. The identity is intended to be better-suited for use on digital platforms, and includes a tweaked version of the Geismar logo, adoption of electric blue and white as corporate colors, and a new custom sans-serif typeface used in communications and inspired by the new custom logotype (which replaces the slab serif typeface used in the PBS logo since 1984). The network is allowing flexibility in implementation (including members re-branding to include PBS in their name for the first time, such as Wisconsin Public Television rebranding as PBS Wisconsin), but is no longer allowing the logo to be displayed independently of the PBS name. PBS is paying out grants to at least 100 members to cover costs associated with the rebranding.\n\n\"PBS\" has received generally positive reviews from television critics and parents of young children. Tim Goodman of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"It's PBS's time to shine.\" Stevenonymous of \"BuzzFeed\" wrote, \"PBS isn't just TV anymore.\" David Zurawik of the \"Baltimore Sun\" wrote, \"If you want a reason to believe in PBS...here it is.\" Mekeisha Madden Toby of \"TheWrap\" wrote, There is a lot to love...on PBS.\" Tim Goodman of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" wrote, \"PBS...is an endless bounty of riches...Ain't this great?.\" Kristen McQuinn of \"Book Riot\" wrote, \"PBS is awesome in every way.\" Caroline Framke of \"Variety\" wrote, \"There's still no beating PBS.\"\n\nSince 53% to 60% of public television's revenues come from private membership donations and grants, most stations solicit individual donations by methods including fundraising, pledge drives or telethons, which disrupt regularly scheduled programming. This has been perceived as potentially annoying since regularly scheduled programming is often replaced with specials aimed at a wider audience (such as music specials aimed at the Baby Boomer generation and financial, health and motivational programs) to solicit new members and donations; during fundraising events, these programs are often interrupted within the broadcast by long-form segments (of six to eight minutes in length) encouraging viewers to donate to their PBS member. Underwriting spots are aired at the end of each program, which differ from traditional commercials in several ways. Each spot must be approved to meet several guidelines. The main guidelines state that underwriting spots cannot be qualitative in any way, nor can they have any call to action.\n\nA 1982 broadcast of the United States Information Agency program \"Let Poland be Poland\" about the martial law declared in Poland in 1981 was widely viewed in the U.S., but met with skepticism on the part of eastern European broadcasters (communist countries at the time) due to concerns that the program's \"provocative and anticommunist\" tone was intended as propaganda.\n\nIn 1999, at least three public television stations were caught selling or trading their mailing lists with the Democratic National Committee. Under IRS regulations, nonprofit organizations are prohibited from participating in political actions. Officials from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting condemned the practice and conducted an investigation into the matter. The stations involved were in New York, Boston, and Washington.\n\nIndividual programs aired by PBS have been the targets of organized campaigns by individuals and groups with opposing views, including former United States Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings.\n\nBill Moyers resigned in 2005 after more than three decades as a PBS regular, citing political pressure to alter the content of his program and saying Chairman of the Board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting Kenneth Tomlinson had mounted a \"vendetta\" against him. Moyers eventually returned to host \"Bill Moyers Journal\", after Tomlinson's resignation from CPB. Subsequently, PBS made room temporarily for rightwing commentator Tucker Carlson, formerly of MSNBC and co-host of CNN's \"Crossfire\", and \"The Journal Editorial Report\" with Paul Gigot, an editor of \"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial page (this program has since moved to Fox News Channel) to partially balance out the perceived left-leaning PBS shows.\n\nIn the 1990s, PBS became involved in a dispute over home video licensing rights with Pacific Arts Corporation, a multimedia company owned and operated by former Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith.\n\nIn 1990, Pacific Arts secured a contract with PBS to distribute their back catalog of programming on VHS under the PBS Home Video banner. However, in the early 1990s, Pacific Arts and PBS went through a series of serious disagreements. Lawsuits were filed: by Nesmith and Pacific Arts against PBS for breach of contract, intentional misrepresentation, intentional concealment, negligent misrepresentation, and interference with contract; and by PBS against Nesmith and Pacific Arts for lost royalties. The lawsuits escalated in 1994 and 1995 into major litigation between the parties over these rights and payments. PBS and Nesmith and Pacific Arts vigorously prosecuted these multimillion-dollar counter-suits.\n\nThe six plaintiffs included PBS, WGBH, WNET, the Ken Burns-owned American Documentaries and Radio Pioneers Film Project and the Children's Television Workshop. They sought approximately $5 million in disputed royalties, advances, guarantees and license fees for programs and the use of the PBS logo from the defendants Pacific Arts and Nesmith.\n\nDue to the cost of the litigation, Pacific Arts was forced to cease distribution operations and suspended the use of the PBS logo on the Pacific Arts videos. Though Pacific Arts distribution system had ceased operating, the various plaintiffs were counting on capturing a personal financial guarantee Nesmith had made to PBS in the original PBS deal in 1990.\n\nThe cases went to jury trial in Federal Court in Los Angeles in February 1999. After three days of deliberation, the jury unanimously sided with Nesmith. The court awarded Pacific Arts $14,625,000 for loss of its rights library, plus $29,250,000 in punitive damages. The jury awarded $3 million to Nesmith personally, including $2 million in punitive damages for a total award to Nesmith and Pacific Arts of $48,875,000. The jury resolved the outstanding license fee issues by ordering Pacific Arts and Nesmith to pay approximately $1.2 million to American Documentaries for \"The Civil War\", about $230,000 to WGBH, and $150,000 to WNET.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Nesmith expressed his personal disappointment with PBS and was quoted by BBC News as stating \"It's like finding your grandmother stealing your stereo. You're happy to get your stereo back, but it's sad to find out your grandmother is a thief.\"\n\nThe decision never went to an appeals court and the final amount paid to Pacific Arts and Nesmith was an undisclosed sum agreed to in an out-of-court settlement.\n\nPBS provides an alternate path for WEA alerts to wireless carriers. The alerts are transmitted through the PBS satellite network on the AMC-21 satellite to PBS stations who broadcast the messages over their transmitters for reception by wireless carriers at their cell sites.<ref name=\"WARN/PBS\"></ref><ref name=\"PBS//UTUBE\"></ref>\n\nThe network is funded by a grant through National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).\n\n\n"}
