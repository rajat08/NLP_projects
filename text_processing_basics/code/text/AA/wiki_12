{"id": "341903", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=341903", "title": "Vogue (magazine)", "text": "Vogue (magazine)\n\nVogue is a fashion and lifestyle magazine covering many topics including fashion, beauty, culture, living, and runway. \"Vogue\" began as a weekly newspaper in 1892 in the United States, before becoming a monthly publication years later. \n\nThe British \"Vogue\" was the first international edition launched in 1916, while the Italian version \"Vogue Italia\" has been called the top fashion magazine in the world. As of today, there are 23 international editions.\n\nIn 1892, Arthur Baldwin Turnure, an American business man, founded \"Vogue\" as a weekly newspaper in the United States, sponsored by Kristoffer Wright; the first issue was published on December 17 of that year, with a cover price of 10 cents (). Turnure's intention was to create a publication that celebrated the \"ceremonial side of life\"; one that \"attracts the sage as well as debutante, men of affairs as well as the belle.\" From its inception, the magazine targeted the new New York upper class. \"Vogue\" glamorously \"recount[ed] their habits, their leisure activities, their social gatherings, the places they frequented, and the clothing they wore...and everyone who wanted to look like them and enter their exclusive circle.\" The magazine at this time was primarily concerned with fashion, with coverage of sports and social affairs included for its male readership. Despite the magazine's content, it grew very slowly during this period.\n\nCondé Montrose Nast purchased \"Vogue\" in 1909 one year before Turnure's death and gradually grew the publication. He changed it to a unisex magazine and started \"Vogue\" overseas in the 1910s. Under Nast, the magazine soon shifted its focus to women, and in turn the price was soon raised. The magazine's number of publications and profit increased dramatically under Nast's management. By 1911, the \"Vogue\" brand had garnered a reputation that it continues to maintain, targeting an elite audience and expanding into the coverage of weddings. According to Condé Nast Russia, after the First World War made deliveries in the Old World impossible, printing began in England. The decision to print in England proved to be successful causing Nast to release the first issue of French \"Vogue\" in 1920.\n\nThe magazine's number of subscriptions surged during the Great Depression, and again during World War II. During this time, noted critic and former \"Vanity Fair\" editor Frank Crowninshield served as its editor, having been moved over from \"Vanity Fair\" by publisher Condé Nast.\n\nIn July 1932, American \"Vogue\" placed its first color photograph on the cover of the magazine. The photograph was taken by photographer Edward Steichen and portrays a woman swimmer holding a beach ball in the air.\n\nLaird Borrelli notes that \"Vogue\" led the decline of fashion illustration in the late 1930s, when they began to replace their celebrated illustrated covers, by artists such as Dagmar Freuchen, with photographic images.\n\nNast was responsible for introducing color printing and the \"two-page spread.\" He greatly impacted the magazine and turned it into a \"successful business\" and the \"women's magazine we recognize today\" and greatly increased the sales volumes until his death in 1942.\n\nIn the 1950s, the decade known as the magazine’s “powerful years,” Jessica Daves became editor-in-chief and, as Rebecca C. Tuite has noted, “Daves led a quiet charge for excellence during one of the most challenging, transformative, and rich decades in the magazine’s history.” Jessica Daves believed that “taste is something that can be taught and learned,” and she edited \"Vogue\" with the conviction that it should be “a vehicle to educate public taste.” While fashion coverage remained a priority, Daves also elevated the written content of American \"Vogue\", particularly championing more robust arts and literature features.\n\nThe Daves era of \"Vogue\" came to an end in 1962, when Diana Vreeland joined the magazine (first as “Associate Editor,” and then, following Daves's departure in December 1962, as editor-in-chief). The pair had diametrically opposed approaches to editing \"Vogue\": Daves famously declared, “I respect fashion … it is exciting … but I am annoyed at people who treat it as a joke, who constantly take sledge-hammers to it … it’s a very serious business.” While Vreeland believed, as she once told Art Director, Alexander Liberman, “it’s only entertainment,” and conversely led the magazine into a period of youth and vitality, but also “extravagance, and luxury and excess.”\n\nIn the 1960s, with Diana Vreeland as editor-in-chief and personality, the magazine began to appeal to the youth of the sexual revolution by focusing more on contemporary fashion and editorial features that openly discussed sexuality. Toward this end, Vogue extended coverage to include East Village boutiques such as Limbo on St. Mark's Place, as well as including features of \"downtown\" personalities such as Andy Warhol's \"Superstar\" Jane Holzer's favorite haunts. \"Vogue\" also continued making household names out of models, a practice that continued with Suzy Parker, Twiggy, Jean Shrimpton, Lauren Hutton, Veruschka, Marisa Berenson, Penelope Tree, and others.\n\nIn 1973, \"Vogue\" became a monthly publication. Under editor-in-chief Grace Mirabella, the magazine underwent extensive editorial and stylistic changes to respond to changes in the lifestyles of its target audience. Mirabella states that she was chosen to change Vogue because \"women weren't interested in reading about or buying clothes that served no purpose in their changing lives.\" She was selected to make the magazine appeal to \"the free, working, \"liberated\" woman of the seventies. She changed the magazine by adding text with interviews, arts coverage, and serious health pieces. When that type of stylistic change fell out of favor in the 1980s, Mirabella was brutally fired. Her take on it: \"For a magazine devoted to style, this was not a very stylish way of telling me.\"\n\nIn July 1988, after \"Vogue\" had begun to lose ground to three-year-old upstart \"Elle\", Anna Wintour was named editor-in-chief. Noted for her trademark bob cut and sunglasses, Wintour sought to revitalize the brand by making it younger and more approachable; she directed the focus towards new and accessible concepts of \"fashion\" for a wider audience. Wintour's influence allowed the magazine to maintain its high circulation, while staff discovered new trends that a broader audience could conceivably afford. For example, the inaugural cover of the magazine under Wintour's editorship featured a three-quarter-length photograph of Michaela Bercu, an Israeli model, wearing a bejeweled Christian Lacroix jacket and a pair of jeans, a departure from her predecessors' tendency to portray a woman's face alone; according to \"The New York Times\", this gave \"greater importance to both her clothing and her body\". As fashion editor Grace Coddington wrote in her memoirs, the cover \"endorsed a democratic new high/low attitude to dressing, added some youthful but sophisticated raciness, and garnished it with a dash of confident energy and drive that implied getting somewhere fast. It was quintessential Anna.\" Throughout her reign at \"Vogue,\" Wintour accomplished her goals to revitalize the magazine and managed to produce some very large editions of the magazine. In fact, the \"September 2004 edition clocked in at 832 pages, the most ever for a monthly magazine.\" Wintour continues to be American \"Vogue\"s editor-in-chief to this day.\n\nThe contrast of Wintour's vision with that of her predecessors was noted as striking by observers, both critics and defenders. Amanda Fortini, fashion and style contributor for \"Slate\", argues that her policy has been beneficial for \"Vogue\":\nAlthough she has had great impact on the magazine, throughout her career, Wintour has been pinned as being cold and difficult to work with. In an article on Biography.com, Wintour admits that she is \"very driven by what [she does],\" and has said \"I am certainly very competitive. I like people who represent the best at what they do, and if that turns you into a perfectionist then maybe I am.\"\n\nAs of March 2019, nine men have been featured on the cover of the American edition:\n\n\nMay 2013 marked the first anniversary of a healthy body initiative that was signed by the magazine's international editors—the initiative represents a commitment from the editors to promote positive body images within the content of \"Vogue\"'s numerous editions. \"Vogue Australia\" editor Edwina McCann explained:\n\nIn the magazine we're moving away from those very young, very thin girls. A year down the track, we ask ourselves what can \"Vogue\" do about it? And an issue like this [June 2013 issue] is what we can do about it. If I was aware of a girl being ill on a photo shoot I wouldn't allow that shoot to go ahead, or if a girl had an eating disorder I would not shoot her.\n\nThe Australian edition's June 2013 issue was entitled Vogue Australia: \"The Body Issue\" and featured articles on exercise and nutrition, as well as a diverse range of models. New York-based Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley, previously featured on the cover of \"Vogue Italia\", also appeared in a swimwear shoot for the June issue.\n\nJonathan Newhouse, Condé Nast International chairman, states that \"\"Vogue\" editors around the world want the magazines to reflect their commitment to the health of the models who appear on the pages and the wellbeing of their readers.\" Alexandra Shulman, one of the magazine's editor, comments on the initiative by stating \"as one of the fashion industry's most powerful voices, \"Vogue\" has a unique opportunity to engage with relevant issues where we feel we can make a difference.\"\n\nThe name \"Vogue\" means \"style\" in French. \"Vogue\" was described by book critic Caroline Weber in a December 2006 edition of \"The New York Times\" as \"the world's most influential fashion magazine\": The publication claims to reach 11 million readers in the US and 12.5 million internationally. Furthermore, Wintour was described as one of the most powerful figures in fashion.\n\nGoogle partnered with \"Vogue\" to feature Google Glass in the September 2013 issue, which featured a 12-page spread. Chris Dale, who manages communications for the Glass team at Google, stated:\n\nIn the September 2015 issue, technology such as Apple Music, Apple Watch, and Amazon Fashion were all featured within the issues 832 pages.\n\nWintour's \"Fashion Night\" initiative was launched in 2009 with the intention of kickstarting the economy following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, by drawing people back into the retail environment and donating proceeds to various charitable causes. The event was co-hosted by \"Vogue\" in 27 cities around the US and 15 countries worldwide, and included online retailers at the beginning of 2011. Debate occurred over the actual profitability of the event in the US, resulting in a potentially permanent hiatus in 2013; however, the event continues in 19 other locations internationally. \"Vogue\" also has the ability to lift the spirits of readers during tough times and revels that \"even in bad times, someone is up for a good time.\" The article states that \"Vogue\" \"make[s] money because they elevate the eye and sometimes the spirit, take the reader someplace special.\" These fantasy tomes feel a boost during economic distress—like liquor and ice cream and movie ticket sales.\"\n\nIn 2006, \"Vogue\" acknowledged salient political and cultural issues by featuring the burqa, as well as articles on prominent Muslim women, their approach to fashion, and the effect of different cultures on fashion and women’s lives. \"Vogue\" also sponsored the \"Beauty Without Borders\" initiative with a US$25,000 donation that was used to establish a cosmetology school for Afghan women. Wintour stated: \"Through the school, we could not only help women in Afghanistan to look and feel better but also give them employment.\" A documentary by Liz Mermin, entitled \"The Beauty Academy of Kabul\", which highlighted the proliferation of Western standards of beauty, criticized the school, suggesting that \"the beauty school could not be judged a success if it did not create a demand for American cosmetics.\"\n\nLeading up to the 2012 US Presidential election, Wintour used her industry clout to host several significant fundraising events in support of the Obama campaign. The first, in 2010, was a dinner with an estimated US$30,000 entry fee. The \"Runway To Win\" initiative recruited prominent designers to create pieces to support the campaign.\n\nIn October 2016, the magazine stated that \"\"Vogue\" endorses Hillary Clinton for president of the United States\". This was the first time that the magazine supported as a single voice a presidential candidate in its 120 years of history.\n\nThe Met Gala is an annual event that is hosted by \"Vogue\" to celebrate the opening of the Metropolitan Museum's fashion exhibit. The Met Gala is the most coveted event of the year in the field of fashion and is attended by A-list celebrities, politicians, designers and fashion editors. \"Vogue\" has hosted the themed event since 1971 under Editor in Chief, Diana Vreeland. In 2013, \"Vogue\" released a special edition of \"Vogue\" entitled Vogue Special Edition: The Definitive Inside Look at the 2013 Met Gala.\n\nIn 2015, \"Vogue\" listed their \"15 Roots Reggae Songs You Should Know\"; and in an interview with Patricia Chin of VP Records, \"Vogue\" highlighted an abbreviated list of early \"reggae royalty\" that recorded at Studio 17 in Kingston, Jamaica which included Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Gregory Isaacs, Dennis Brown, Burning Spear, Toots and the Maytals, The Heptones, and Bunny Wailer. In addition to their coverage of historically significant artists, \"Vogue\" is a source for contemporary music news on artists such as Jay-Z, Eminem, Tom Petty, and Taylor Swift, as well as being an influencer that introduces new artists to the scene such as Suzi Analogue in 2017.\n\nAs Wintour came to personify the magazine's image, both she and \"Vogue\" drew critics. Wintour's one-time assistant at the magazine, Lauren Weisberger, wrote a \"roman à clef\" entitled \"The Devil Wears Prada\". Published in 2003, the novel became a bestseller and was adapted as a highly successful, Academy Award-nominated film in 2006. The central character resembled Weisberger, and her boss was a powerful editor-in-chief of a fictionalized version of \"Vogue\". The novel portrays a magazine ruled by \"the Antichrist and her coterie of fashionistas, who exist on cigarettes, Diet Dr Pepper, and mixed green salads\", according to a review in \"The New York Times\". The editor is described by Weisberger as being \"an empty, shallow, bitter woman who has tons and tons of gorgeous clothes and not much else\". The success of both the novel and the film brought new attention from a wide global audience to the power and glamour of the magazine, and the industry it continues to lead.\n\nIn 2007, \"Vogue\" drew criticism from the anti-smoking group, \"Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids\", for carrying tobacco advertisements in the magazine. The group claims that volunteers sent the magazine more than 8,000 protest emails or faxes regarding the ads. The group also claimed that in response, they received scribbled notes faxed back on letters that had been addressed to Wintour stating, \"Will you stop? You're killing trees!\" In response, a spokesperson for Condé Nast released an official statement: \"\"Vogue\" does carry tobacco advertising. Beyond that we have no further comment.\"\n\nIn April 2008, American \"Vogue\" featured a cover photo by photographer Annie Leibovitz of Gisele Bündchen and the basketball player LeBron James. This was the third time that Vogue featured a male on the cover of the American issue (the other two men were actors George Clooney and Richard Gere), and the first in which the man was black. Some observers criticized the cover as a prejudicial depiction of James because his pose with Bündchen was reminiscent of a poster for the film \"King Kong\". Further criticism arose when the website \"Watching the Watchers\" analyzed the photo alongside the World War I recruitment poster titled \"Destroy This Mad Brute\". James reportedly however liked the cover shoot.\n\nIn February 2011, just before the 2011 Syrian protests unfolded, \"Vogue\" published a controversial piece by Joan Juliet Buck on Asma al-Assad, wife of the Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. A number of journalists criticized the article as glossing over the poor human rights record of Bashar al-Assad. According to reports, the Syrian government paid the U.S. lobbying firm Brown Lloyd James US$5,000 per month to arrange for and manage the article.\n\nIn 2009, the feature-length documentary \"The September Issue\" was released; it was an inside view of the production of the record-breaking September 2007 issue of U.S. \"Vogue\", directed by R. J. Cutler. The film was shot over eight months as Wintour prepared the issue, and included testy exchanges between Wintour and her creative director Grace Coddington. The issue became the largest ever published at the time; over 5 pounds in weight and 840 pages in length, a world record for a monthly magazine Since then, that record has been broken by \"Vogue\"s 2012 September issue, which came in at 916 pages.\n\nAlso in 2012, HBO released a documentary entitled \"In Vogue: The Editor's Eye\", in conjunction with the 120th anniversary of the magazine. Drawing on \"Vogue\"s extensive archives, the film featured behind-the-scenes interviews with longtime Vogue editors, including Wintour, Coddington, Tonne Goodman, Babs Simpson, Hamish Bowles, and Phyllis Posnick. Celebrated subjects and designers in the fashion industry, such as Nicole Kidman, Sarah Jessica Parker, Linda Evangelista, Vera Wang, and Marc Jacobs, also appear in the film. The editors share personal stories about collaborating with top photographers, such as Leibovitz, and the various day-to-day responsibilities and interactions of a fashion editor at \"Vogue\". The film was directed and produced by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato. In October 2012, \"Vogue\" also released a book titled \"Vogue: The Editor's Eye\" to complement the documentary.\n\nIn 2013, \"Vogue\" launched the \"Vogue\" video channel that can be accessed via their website. The channel was launched in conjunction with Conde Nast's multi-platform media initiative. Mini-series that have aired on the video channel include \"Vogue Weddings\", \"The Monday Makeover\", \"From the Vogue Closet\", \"Fashion Week\", \"Elettra's Goodness\", \"Jeanius\", \"Vintage Bowles\", \"The Backstory\", \"Beauty Mark\", \"Met Gala\", \"Voguepedia\", \"Vogue Voices\", \"Vogue Diaries\", \"CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund\", and \"Monday's with Andre\".\n\nBooks published by \"Vogue\" include \"In Vogue: An Illustrated History of the World's Most Famous Fashion Magazine\", \"Vogue: The Covers\", \"Vogue: The Editor's Eye\", \"Vogue Living: House, Gardens, People\", \"The World in Vogue\", \"Vogue Weddings: Brides, Dresses, Designers\", and \"Nostalgia in Vogue\".\n\nLaunched in 2011 by Condé Nast Digital, Voguepedia is a fashion encyclopedia that also includes an archive of every issue of \"Vogue\"s American edition since 1892. Only Vogue staff are permitted to contribute to the encyclopedia, unlike the VogueEncyclo—hosted by \"Vogue Italia\"—that receives contributions from anyone. As of May 9, 2013, the site is not fully functional, as code still shows in search results and only certain search terms yield results.\n\n\"Vogue\" has also created an easily navigable website that includes six different content categories for viewers to explore. The website includes an archive with issues from 1892 forward for those whom subscribe for the website. The magazines online are the same as those that were printed in that time and are not cut or shortened from the original content.\n\n\"Vogue\" launched the teaser for their podcast series on September 10, 2015. The magazine announced that star André Leon Talley would host the podcasts and the inaugural twenty-one minute podcast was released on September 14, 2015, featuring Anna Wintour. Talley comments that he has \"been a longtime storyteller at Vogue and it’s just another format for telling stories—as at Vogue, we love to tell the story of style, fashion, and what is absolutely a part of the culture at the moment,\" hence why the magazine has decided to create podcasts.\n\nThe app was introduced on April 26, 2016 as a way for the magazine to become more mobile friendly. The \"Vogue\" app displays content on mobile devices and gives people the ability to view the magazine content wherever they go. The app has new content everyday and people can choose to receive content recommended just for their taste. In addition, the app allows one to save stories for later and or read offline. Lastly, the app provides notifications for fashion outbreaks and for new stories that are published pertaining to that viewer's particular taste.\n\nIn 2005, Condé Nast launched \"Men's Vogue.\" The magazine ceased publication as an independent publication in October 2008, being the December/January 2009 their last issue. It was intended to be published as a supplement of \"Vogue\", being the Spring 2009 the last issue of the magazine altogether.\n\n\"Vogue Australia\" (ISSN 0042-8019) covers Australian fashion and lifestyle. Early magazines have running title: Vogue supplement for Australia (since 1952). Has occasional supplements: Vogue Business Australia, Vogue Man Australia, Vogue Fashion Week Australia. In Australia, Vogue Living was first published in 1967. \n\nCondé Nast also publishes \"Teen Vogue\", a version of the magazine for teenage girls in the United States. South Korea and Australia publish a \"Vogue Girl\" magazine (currently suspended from further publication), in addition to the \"Vogue Living\" and \"Vogue Entertaining + Travel\" editions.\n\n\"Vogue Hommes International\" is an international men's fashion magazine based in Paris, France, and \"L'uomo Vogue\" is the Italian men's version. Other Italian versions of \"Vogue\" include \"Vogue Casa\" and \"Bambini Vogue\".\n\nUntil 1961, \"Vogue\" was also the publisher of \"Vogue Patterns\", a home sewing pattern company. It was sold to Butterick Publishing which also licensed the Vogue name. \"Vogue China\" was launched in September 2005, with Australian model Gemma Ward on the cover flanked by Chinese models. In 2007, an Arabic edition of \"Vogue\" was rejected by Condé Nast International. October 2007 saw the launch of \"Vogue India\", and \"Vogue Turkey\" was launched in March 2010.\n\nOn March 5, 2010, 16 International editors-in-chief of Vogue met in Paris to discuss the 2nd Fashion's Night Out. Present in the meeting were the 16 International editors-in-chief of \"Vogue\": Wintour (American \"Vogue\"), Emmanuelle Alt (French \"Vogue\"), Franca Sozzani (Italian \"Vogue\"), Alexandra Shulman (British \"Vogue\"), Kirstie Clements (Australian \"Vogue\"), Aliona Doletskaya (Russian \"Vogue\"), Angelica Cheung (Chinese \"Vogue\"), Christiane Arp (German \"Vogue\"), Priya Tanna (Indian \"Vogue\"), Rosalie Huang (Taiwanese \"Vogue\"), Paula Mateus (Portuguese \"Vogue\"), Seda Domaniç (Turkish \"Vogue\"), Yolanda Sacristan (Spanish \"Vogue\"), Eva Hughes (Mexican \"Vogue\"), Mitsuko Watanabe (Japanese \"Vogue\"), and Daniela Falcao (Brazilian \"Vogue\").\n\nSince 2010, seven new editors-in-chief joined \"Vogue\": Victoria Davydova replaced Aliona Doletskaya as editor-in-chief of \"Russian Vogue\"; Emmanuelle Alt became \"French Vogue\" 's editor-in-chief after Carine Roitfeld resigned; Edwina McCann became \"Australian Vogue\" editor-in-chief after Kirstie Clements was fired; Kelly Talamas replaced Eva Hughes at \"Vogue Mexico\" and \"Vogue Latin America\", when Hughes was named CEO of Condé Nast Mexico and Latin America in 2012; and Karin Swerink, Kullawit Laosukrsi, and Masha Tsukanova were appointed editors-in-chief of the newly launched Netherlands, Thailand, and Ukraine editions, respectively.\n\nAt the beginning of 2013 the Japanese version, \"Vogue Hommes Japan\", ended publication. In July 2016, the launch of \"Vogue Arabia\" was announced, first as a dual English and Arabic language website, then with a print edition to follow in spring 2017.\n\nOn January 11, 2017, it was announced that Eugenia de la Torriente will become the new editor-in-chief of \"Vogue Spain\". On January 20, it was officially announced that Emanuele Farneti will become the new editor-in-chief of \"Vogue Italia\", after the unexpected passing of long-time editor, Franca Sozzani in December 2016. On January 25, it was announced that \"Vogue British\"'s editor-in-chief, Alexandra Shulman, will leave the magazine in June 2017, after 25 years. On April 10, 2017, it was announced that Edward Enninful will become the new editor-in-chief of British Vogue, the first male editor of the 100 years magazine. On April 13, 2017, it was revealed that Vogue Arabia's first editor-in-chief, Deena Aljuhani, was fired and a new editor it is set to be announced. \n\nIn June 2017, it was announced that the Polish edition, \"Vogue Polska\", was in preparation, with Filip Niedenthal as editor-in-chief. The local publisher, Visteria, signed a 5-year licence deal with Condé Nast. The printed magazine and its website launched on February 14, 2018.\n\nIn February 2018, the Czech-language edition was announced.

{"id": "22112840", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=22112840", "title": "Newspaper", "text": "Newspaper\n\nA newspaper is a periodical publication containing written information about current events and is often typed in black ink with a white or gray background.\n\nNewspapers can cover a wide variety of fields such as politics, business, sports and art, and often include materials such as opinion columns, weather forecasts, reviews of local services, obituaries, birth notices, crosswords, editorial cartoons, comic strips, and advice columns.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published in print (usually on cheap, low-grade paper called newsprint). However, today most newspapers are also published on websites as online newspapers, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as information sheets for merchants. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record.\n\nNewspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing editorials written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"op-eds\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and columns that express the personal opinions of columnists, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw data of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no byline; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including literature, film, television, theater, fine arts, and architecture) and of local services such as restaurants; obituaries, birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, editorial cartoons, gag cartoons, and comic strips; advice columns, food, and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on streaming video services like Netflix. Newspapers have classified ad sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in Internet websites for selling goods, such as Craigslist and eBay has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of subscription revenue, newsstand sales, and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including display ads, classified ads, and their online equivalents). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The editorial independence of a newspaper is thus always subject to the interests of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as newspapers of record.\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to news agencies (wire services) (such as the Associated Press, Reuters, or Agence France-Presse), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the content to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55 million copies). The late 2000s–early 2010s global recession, combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses. Worldwide annual revenue approached $100 billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9. Revenue in 2016 fell to only $53 billion, hurting every major publisher as their efforts to gain online income fell far short of the goal.\n\nThe decline in advertising revenues affected both the print and online media as well as all other mediums; print advertising was once lucrative but has greatly declined, and the prices of online advertising are often lower than those of their print precursors. Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the web) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by crowdsourcing both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, journalism (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of news aggregators, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of web traffic. Increasing paywalling of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the Ordinari Post Tijdender, which was established in Stockholm in 1645.\n\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:\n\nIn Ancient Rome, \"Acta Diurna\", or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called Dibao, circulated among court officials during the late Han dynasty (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the \"Kaiyuan Za Bao\" (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese Tang Dynasty published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials. In 1582, there was the first reference to privately published newssheets in Beijing, during the late Ming Dynasty.\n\nIn early modern Europe, the increased cross-border interaction created a rising need for information which was met by concise handwritten news-sheets. In 1556, the government of Venice first published the monthly \"notizie scritte\", which cost one \"gazette\", a small coin. These avvisi were handwritten newsletters and used to convey political, military, and economic news quickly and efficiently to Italian cities (1500–1700)—sharing some characteristics of newspapers though usually not considered true newspapers. However, none of these publications fully met the classical criteria for proper newspapers, as they were typically not intended for the general public and restricted to a certain range of topics.\n\nThe first mechanical, movable type printing that allowed the mass production of printed books was invented by Johann Gutenberg. In the 50 years after Gutenberg started printing, an estimated 500,000 books were in circulation, printed on about 1,000 presses across the continent. Gutenberg's invention was a simple device, but it launched a revolution marked by repeated advances in technology and, as a result, a popularization of the ideals of liberty and freedom of information exchange. \nThe emergence of the new media in the 17th century has to be seen in close connection with the spread of the printing press from which the publishing press derives its name. The German-language \"Relation aller Fürnemmen und gedenckwürdigen Historien\", printed from 1605 onwards by Johann Carolus in Strasbourg, is often recognized as the first newspaper. At the time, Strasbourg was a free imperial city in the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation; the first newspaper of modern Germany was the \"Avisa\", published in 1609 in Wolfenbüttel. They distinguished themselves from other printed material by being published on a regular basis. They reported on a variety of current events to a broad public audience. Within a few decades, newspapers could be found in all the major cities of Europe, from Venice to London.\n\nThe Dutch \"Courante uyt Italien, Duytslandt, &c.\" ('Courant from Italy, Germany, etc.') of 1618 was the first to appear in folio- rather than quarto-size. Amsterdam, a center of world trade, quickly became home to newspapers in many languages, often before they were published in their own country. The first English-language newspaper, \"Corrant out of Italy, Germany, etc.\", was published in Amsterdam in 1620. A year and a half later, \"Corante, or weekely newes from Italy, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, France and the Low Countreys.\" was published in England by an \"N.B.\" (generally thought to be either Nathaniel Butter or Nicholas Bourne) and Thomas Archer. The first newspaper in France was published in 1631, \"La Gazette\" (originally published as \"Gazette de France\").\nThe first newspaper in Italy, in accordance with the oldest issue still preserved, was \"Di Genova\" published in 1639 in Genoa. The first newspaper in Portugal, \"A Gazeta da Restauração\", was published in 1641 in Lisbon. The first Spanish newspaper, Gaceta de Madrid, was published in 1661.\n\n\"Post- och Inrikes Tidningar\" (founded as \"Ordinari Post Tijdender\") was first published in Sweden in 1645, and is the oldest newspaper still in existence, though it now publishes solely online. \"Opregte Haarlemsche Courant\" from Haarlem, first published in 1656, is the oldest paper still printed. It was forced to merge with the newspaper \"Haarlems Dagblad\" in 1942 when Germany occupied the Netherlands. Since then the \"Haarlems Dagblad\" has appeared with the subtitle \"Oprechte Haerlemse Courant 1656\". \"Merkuriusz Polski Ordynaryjny\" was published in Kraków, Poland in 1661. The first successful English daily, \"The Daily Courant\", was published from 1702 to 1735.\n\nIn Boston in 1690, Benjamin Harris published \"Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick\". This is considered the first newspaper in the American colonies even though only one edition was published before the paper was suppressed by the government. In 1704, the governor allowed \"The Boston News-Letter\" to be published and it became the first continuously published newspaper in the colonies. Soon after, weekly papers began publishing in New York and Philadelphia. These early newspapers followed the British format and were usually four pages long. They mostly carried news from Britain and content depended on the editor's interests. In 1783, the \"Pennsylvania Evening Post\" became the first American daily.\n\nIn 1752, John Bushell published the \"Halifax Gazette\", which claims to be \"Canada's first newspaper.\" However, its official descendant, the \"Royal Gazette\", is a government publication for legal notices and proclamations rather than a proper newspaper; In 1764, the \"Quebec Gazette\" was first printed 21 June 1764 and remains the oldest continuously published newspaper in North America as the \"Quebec Chronicle-Telegraph\". It is currently published as an English-language weekly from its offices at 1040 Belvédère, suite 218, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. In 1808, the \"Gazeta do Rio de Janeiro\" had its first edition, printed in devices brought from England, publishing news favourable for the government of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves since it was produced by the official press service of the Portuguese crown.\n\nIn 1821, after the ending of the ban of private newspaper circulation, appears the first non-imperial printed publication, \"Diário do Rio de Janeiro\", though there existed already the \"Correio Braziliense\", published by Hipólito José da Costa at the same time as the \"Gazeta\", but from London and with forcefully advocated political and critical ideas, aiming to expose the administration's flaws. The first newspaper in Peru was \"El Peruano\", established in October 1825 and still published today, but with several name changes.\n\n During the Tang Dynasty in China (618–906), the \"Kaiyuan Za Bao\" published the government news; it was block-printed onto paper. It is sometimes considered one of the earliest newspapers to be published. The first recorded attempt to found a newspaper of the modern type in South Asia was by William Bolts, a Dutchman in the employ of the British East India Company in September 1768 in Calcutta. However, before he could begin his newspaper, he was deported back to Europe. In 1780 the first newsprint from this region, \"Hicky's Bengal Gazette\", was published by an Irishman, James Augustus Hicky. He used it as a means to criticize the British rule through journalism.\n\nThe history of Middle Eastern newspapers goes back to the 19th century. Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the Ottoman and Persian Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world. The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in Pera. Indigenous Middle Eastern journalism started in 1828, when Muhammad Ali, Khedive of Egypt, ordered the local establishment of the gazette \"Vekayi-i Misriye\" (\"Egyptian Affairs\"). It was first paper written in Ottoman Turkish and Arabic on opposite pages, and later in Arabic only, under the title \"al-Waqa'i'a al-Masriya\".\n\nThe first non-official Turkish newspaper, \"Ceride-i Havadis\" (Register of Events), was published by an Englishman, William Churchill, in 1840. The first private newspaper to be published by Turkish journalists, \"Tercüman-ı Ahvâl\" (Interpreter of Events), was founded by İbrahim Şinasi and Agah Efendi and issued in 1860. The first newspaper in Iran, \"Kaghaz-e Akhbar\" (The Newspaper), was created for the government by Mirza Saleh Shirazi in 1837. The first journals in the Arabian Peninsula appeared in Hijaz, once it had become independent of Ottoman rule, towards the end of World War I.One of the earliest women to sign her articles in the Arab press was the female medical practitioner Galila Tamarhan, who contributed articles to a medical magazine called \"Ya'asub al-Tib\" (Leader in Medicine) in the 1860s.\n\nBy the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspaper-type publications though not all of them developed in the same way; content was vastly shaped by regional and cultural preferences. Advances in printing technology related to the Industrial Revolution enabled newspapers to become an even more widely circulated means of communication, as new printing technologies made printing less expensive and more efficient. In 1814, \"The Times\" (London) acquired a printing press capable of making 1,100 impressions per hour. Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once. This innovation made newspapers cheaper and thus available to a larger part of the population.\n\nIn 1830, the first inexpensive \"penny press\" newspaper came to the market: Lynde M. Walter's Boston \"Transcript\". Penny press papers cost about one sixth the price of other newspapers and appealed to a wider audience, including less educated and lower-income people. In France, Émile de Girardin started \"La Presse\" in 1836, introducing cheap, advertising-supported dailies to France. In 1848, August Zang, an Austrian who knew Girardin in Paris, returned to Vienna to introduce the same methods with \"Die Presse\" (which was named for and frankly copied Girardin's publication).\n\nWhile most newspapers are aimed at a broad spectrum of readers, usually geographically defined, some focus on groups of readers defined more by their interests than their location: for example, there are daily and weekly business newspapers (e.g., \"The Wall Street Journal and India Today\") and sports newspapers. More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local gay community or indie rock enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\nA daily newspaper is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays) and often of some national holidays. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its cover date, further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include breaking news which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as Newsnight in the United Kingdom. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared, \"Einkommende Zeitung\", published by Timotheus Ritzsch in Leipzig, Germany.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a Sunday newspaper, distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to \"The Times\".\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., \"The Observer\", not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by \"The Guardian\" in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as Sunday comics, Sunday magazines (such as \"The New York Times Magazine\" and \"The Sunday Times Magazine\").\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on Christmas Day, but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, Christmas Eve when Christmas Day is falling on Sunday.\n\nWeekly newspapers are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week Christmas Day is falling on.\n\nA local newspaper serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area. Large metropolitan newspapers often have large distribution networks, and can be found outside their normal area, sometimes widely, sometimes from fewer sources.\n\nMost nations have at least one newspaper that circulates throughout the whole country: a national newspaper. Some national newspapers, such as the \"Financial Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\", are specialised (in these examples, on financial matters). There are many national newspapers in the United Kingdom, but only a few in the United States and Canada. In Canada, \"The Globe and Mail\" is sold throughout the country. In the United States, in addition to national newspapers as such, \"The New York Times\" is available throughout the country.\nThere is also a small group of newspapers which may be characterized as international newspapers. Some, such as \"The New York Times International Edition\", (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to expatriates, significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as Jerusalem and Mumbai, newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and locally published newspapers in many languages, are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of Florida, so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of Quebec visit for long stays during the winter (\"snowbirds\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as \"Le Droit\".\n\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.\n\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the mail, sold at newsstands, grocery stores and convenience stores, and delivered to libraries and bookstores. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the Press Complaints Commission in the UK. But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable, Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the \"Southport Reporter\" in the UK and the \"Seattle Post-Intelligencer\", which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of personalization through on-demand printing technologies or with online news aggregator websites like Google news. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher. In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer. Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself—editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names—as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called news bureaus or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors copy edit the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with proofreaders and fact checkers.\nReporters are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and graphic artists provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a beat, such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. Printers and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an offset web press (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's print run might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, webmasters and web designers may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the circulation department liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by newspaper carriers, at retailers, and through vending machines. Free newspapers do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include graphic designers, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an advertising-free newspaper, there is no advertising department.\n\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising—the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial—or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\" offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising rate card provides a good example of editioning.\n\n\"See also Los Angeles Times suburban sections.\"\n\nMost modern newspapers are in one of three sizes:\n\nNewspapers are usually printed on cheap, off-white paper known as newsprint. Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality letterpress printing to higher-quality, four-color process, offset printing. In addition, desktop computers, word processing software, graphics software, digital cameras and digital prepress and typesetting technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative layouts and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the \"Financial Times\" is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and Sheffield's weekly sports publication derives its name, the \"Green 'Un\", from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" is also printed on pink paper while \"L'Équipe\" (formerly \"L'Auto\") is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the Giro d'Italia wears a pink jersey.\n\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the Alliance for Audited Media maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the \"Guinness Book of Records\", the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper \"Trud\" exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly \"Argumenty i Fakty\" boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers—the \"Yomiuri Shimbun\", \"Asahi Shimbun\", and \"Mainichi Shimbun\"—with circulations well above 5.5 million. Germany's \"Bild\", with a circulation of 3.8 million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, \"The Sun\" is the top seller, with around 3.24 million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., \"The Wall Street Journal\" has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02 million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed OECD nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008. In India, \"The Times of India\" is the largest-circulation English newspaper, with 3.14 million copies daily. According to the 2009 Indian Readership Survey, the \"Dainik Jagran\" is the most-read, local-language (Hindi) newspaper, with 55.7 million readers. According to Tom Standage of \"The Economist\", India currently has daily newspaper circulation of 110 million copies.\nA common measure of a newspaper's health is market penetration, expressed as a percentage of households that receive a copy of the newspaper against the total number of households in the paper's market area. In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling. Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a workweek subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\nA newspaper typically generates 70–80% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions. The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called \"editorial content\", \"editorial matter\", or simply \"editorial\", although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time – early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The business model of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by \"The Sun\", a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the web have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now. Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including Craigslist, employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the advertorial emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an opposite-editorial which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. Advertorials commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a press release than of an objective news story. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.\n\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called \"journalism\". In the yellow journalism era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around World War II. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived bias; and scandals involving plagiarism and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called press barons, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as Gannett, The McClatchy Company, Hearst Corporation, Cox Enterprises, Landmark Media Enterprises LLC, Morris Communications, The Tribune Company, Hollinger International, News Corporation, Swift Communications, etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the \"op-ed\" (\"opposite the editorial page\") and \"letters to the editors\" sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing ombudsmen, developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of online journalism posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid newspaper circulation has declined, while advertising revenue—the bulk of most newspapers' income—has been shifting from print to social media and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a paywall and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.\n\nIn April 1995, \"The American Reporter\" became the first daily Internet-based newspaper with its own paid reporters and original content. The future of newspapers in countries with high levels of Internet access has been widely debated as the industry has faced down-soaring newsprint prices, slumping ad sales, the loss of much classified advertising, and precipitous drops in circulation. Since the late-1990s, the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy, or severe cutbacks has risen—especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001.\n\nThe debate has become more urgent lately, as the 2008–2009 recession shaved newspapers' profits and as once-explosive growth in web revenue has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue. At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a cyclical trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete. , an increasing percentage of millennials get their news from social media websites. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering \"digital editions,\" accessible via computers and mobile devices. Online advertising allows news websites to show catered ads, based on a visitor's interests.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "136566", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=136566", "title": "Financial Times", "text": "Financial Times\n\nThe Financial Times (FT) is an English-language international daily newspaper owned by Japanese company Nikkei, Inc., headquartered in London, with a special emphasis on business and economic news.\n\nThe paper was founded in 1888 by James Sheridan and Horatio Bottomley, and merged in 1945 with its closest rival, the \"Financial News\" (which had been founded in 1884).\n\nThe \"Financial Times\" has a record paying readership of one million, three-quarters of which are digital subscriptions (as of April 2019).\n\nOn 23 July 2015, Nikkei Inc. agreed to buy the \"Financial Times\" from Pearson for £844m ($1.32 billion) and the acquisition was completed on 30 November 2015.\n\nThe \"FT\" was launched as the London Financial Guide on 10 January 1888, renaming itself the \"Financial Times\" on 13 February the same year. Describing itself as the friend of \"The Honest Financier, the Bona Fide Investor, the Respectable Broker, the Genuine Director, and the Legitimate Speculator\", it was a four-page journal. The readership was the financial community of the City of London, its only rival being the slightly older and more daring \"Financial News\". On 2 January 1893 the \"FT\" began printing on light salmon-pink paper to distinguish it from the similarly named \"Financial News\": at the time it was also cheaper to print on unbleached paper (several other more general newspapers, such as \"The Sporting Times\", had the same policy), but nowadays it is more expensive as the paper has to be dyed specially.\n\nAfter 57 years of rivalry the \"Financial Times\" and the \"Financial News\" were merged in 1945 by Brendan Bracken to form a single six-page newspaper. The \"Financial Times\" brought a higher circulation while the \"Financial News\" provided much of the editorial talent. The \"Lex\" column was also introduced from \"Financial News\".\n\nPearson bought the paper in 1957. Over the years the paper grew in size, readership and breadth of coverage. It established correspondents in cities around the world, reflecting a renewed impetus in the world economy towards globalisation. As cross-border trade and capital flows increased during the 1970s, the \"FT\" began international expansion, facilitated by developments in technology and the growing acceptance of English as the international language of business. On 1 January 1979 the first \"FT\" (Continental Europe edition) was printed outside the UK, in Frankfurt. Since then, with increased international coverage, the \"FT\" has become a global newspaper, printed in 22 locations with five international editions to serve the UK, continental Europe, the U.S., Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe European edition is distributed in continental Europe and Africa. It is printed Monday to Saturday at five centres across Europe reporting on matters concerning the European Union, the Euro and European corporate affairs.\n\nIn 1994 \"FT\" launched a luxury lifestyle magazine, \"How To Spend It\". In 2009 it launched a standalone website for the magazine.\n\nOn 13 May 1995 the \"Financial Times\" group made its first foray into the online world with the launch of FT.com. This provided a summary of news from around the globe, which was supplemented in February 1996 with stock price coverage; the second-generation site was launched in spring 1996. The site was funded by advertising and contributed to the online advertising market in the UK in the late 1990s. Between 1997 and 2000 the site underwent several revamps and changes of strategy, as the FT Group and Pearson reacted to changes online. \"FT\" introduced subscription services in 2002. FT.com is one of the few UK news sites successfully funded by individual subscription.\nIn 1997 the \"FT\" launched a U.S. edition, printed in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Orlando and Washington, D.C., although the newspaper was first printed outside New York City in 1985. In September 1998 the \"FT\" became the first UK-based newspaper to sell more copies internationally than within the UK.\n\nIn 2000 the \"Financial Times\" started publishing a German-language edition, \"Financial Times Deutschland\", with a news and editorial team based in Hamburg. Its initial circulation in 2003 was 90,000. It was originally a joint venture with a German publishing firm, Gruner + Jahr. In January 2008 the \"FT\" sold its 50% stake to its German partner. \"FT Deutschland\" never made a profit and is said to have accumulated losses of €250 million over 12 years. It closed on 7 December 2012.\n\nThe \"Financial Times\" launched a new weekly supplement for the fund management industry on 4 February 2002. \"FT fund management\" (FTfm) was and still is distributed with the paper every Monday. FTfm is the world's largest-circulation fund management title.\n\nSince 2005 the \"FT\" has sponsored the annual <nowiki>\"Financial Times\"</nowiki> and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.\n\nOn 23 April 2007 the \"FT\" unveiled a \"refreshed\" version of the newspaper and introduced a new slogan, \"We Live in Financial Times.\"\n\nIn 2007 the \"FT\" pioneered a metered paywall, which lets visitors to its site read a limited number of free articles during any one month before asking them to pay. Four years later the \"FT\" launched its HTML5 mobile internet app. Smartphones and tablets now drive 12% of subscriptions and 19% of traffic to FT.com. In 2012 the number of digital subscribers surpassed the circulation of the newspaper for the first time and the \"FT\" drew almost half of its revenue from subscriptions rather than advertising.\n\nSince 2010 the \"FT\" has been available on Bloomberg Terminal.\n\nSince 2013 the \"FT\" has been available on Wisers platform.\n\nIn 2016, the \"Financial Times\" acquired a controlling stake in Alpha Grid, a London-based media company specialising in the development and production of quality branded content across a range of channels, including broadcast, video, digital, social and events.\n\nIn 2018, the \"Financial Times\" acquired a controlling stake in Longitude, a specialist provider of thought leadership and research services to a multinational corporate and institutional client base. This investment built on the \"Financial Times\"’s recent growth in several business areas, including branded content via the acquisition of Alpha Grid, and conferences and events through \"Financial Times Live\" and extends the \"FT\"'s traditional commercial offering into a wider set of integrated services.\n\nIn January 2019 the \"FT\" began a series of investigative articles detailing fraud suspicions at German payments group Wirecard. When the Wirecard share price plunged, German news media speculated that market manipulation was behind this attack on a German corporate, focusing on the lead author of the \"FT\" series, Dan McCrum. The Public prosecutor's office in Munich subsequently launched an investigation. After the formal complaint of an investor, Wirecard and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority the responsible state's attorney is currently investigating several \"FT\" journalists.\n\nAccording to the Global Capital Markets Survey, which measures readership habits amongst most senior financial decision makers in the world's largest financial institutions, the \"Financial Times\" is considered the most important business read, reaching 36% of the sample population, 11% more than \"The Wall Street Journal\" (WSJ), its main rival. \"The Economist\", which was once 50% owned by \"FT\", reaches 32%. \"FT\"'s \"The Banker\" also proved vital reading, reaching 24%. In addition \"FT\" was regarded as the most credible publication in reporting financial and economic issues among the Worldwide Professional Investment Community audience. \"The Economist\" was also rated the third most credible title by most influential professional investors (those who personally managed asset funds worth $5 billion or more), while the \"WSJ\" was second.\n\nThe \"FT\" is split into two sections. The first section covers domestic and international news, editorial commentary on politics and economics from \"FT\" journalists such as Martin Wolf, Gillian Tett and Edward Luce, and opinion pieces from globally renowned leaders, policymakers, academics and commentators. The second section consists of financial data and news about companies and markets. Despite being generally regarded as primarily a financial newspaper, it does also contain TV listings, weather and other more informal articles.\n\nAbout 110 of its 475 journalists are outside the UK.\n\nThe \"Lex\" column is a daily feature on the back page of the first section. It features analyses and opinions covering global economics and finance. The \"FT\" calls \"Lex\" its agenda-setting column. The column first appeared on Monday, 1 October 1945. The name may originally have stood for \"Lex Mercatoria\", a Latin expression meaning literally \"merchant law\". It was conceived by Hargreaves Parkinson for the \"Financial News\" in the 1930s and moved to the \"Financial Times\" when the two merged.\n\n\"Lex\" boasts some distinguished alumni who have gone on to make careers in business and government – including Nigel Lawson (former Conservative Chancellor of the Exchequer), Richard Lambert (CBI director and former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee), Martin Taylor (former chief executive of Barclays), John Makinson (chairman and chief executive of Penguin), John Gardiner (former chairman of Tesco), David Freud (former UBS banker and Labour adviser, now a Conservative peer), John Kingman (former head of UKFI and a banker at Rothschild's), George Graham (RBS banker), Andrew Balls (head of European portfolio management at PIMCO) and Jo Johnson (former Conservative Member of Parliament for Orpington).\n\nThe \"FT\" publishes a Saturday edition of the newspaper called the \"Financial Times Weekend\". It consists of international economic and political news, \"Companies & Markets\", \"Life & Arts\", \"House & Home\" and \"FT Magazine\".\n\n\"How to Spend It\" is a monthly magazine published with \"FT Weekend\". Founded and launched by Julia Carrick with Lucia van der Post as founding editor, its articles concern luxury goods such as yachts, mansions, apartments, horlogerie, haute couture and automobiles, as well as fashion and columns by individuals in the arts, gardening, food, and hotel and travel industries. \"How to Spend It\" started in 1967 as a one-page consumer goods feature in the newspaper, which was edited by Sheila Black, a former actor and \"FT\"’s first female journalist. To celebrate its 15th anniversary, \"FT\" launched the on-line version of this publication, Howtospendit.com on 3 October 2009.\n\nSome media commentators were taken aback by the online launch of a website supporting conspicuous consumption during the financial austerity of the late-2000s recession. The magazine has been derided in rival publishers' blogs, as \"repellent\" in the \"Telegraph\" and \"a latter-day \"Ab Fab\" manual\" in the \"Guardian\". A 'well-thumbed' copy of the supplement was found when rebel forces broke into Colonel Gaddafi's Tripoli compound during the 2011 Libyan Civil War.\n\nThe \"FT\" advocates free markets and is in favour of globalisation, as well as globalist policies.\n\nDuring the 1980s it supported Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan's monetarist policies. It has supported the UK Labour Party in the past, including at the general election in 1992 when Neil Kinnock was Labour leader.\n\nThe \"FT\"'s editorials tend to be europhilic, supporting the European Union (including Britain's membership thereof) in the context of a common economic market and opposing political integration. The FT was firmly opposed to the Iraq War.\n\nIn the general election in the UK in 2010 the \"FT\" was receptive to the Liberal Democrats' positions on civil liberties and political reform, and praised the then Labour leader Gordon Brown for his response to the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, but on balance it backed the Conservatives while questioning their tendency to Euroscepticism.\n\nAt the subsequent general election in 2015, the \"FT\" called for the continuation of the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that had governed for the previous five years.\n\nIn the 2017 UK general election a \"Financial Times\" editorial reluctantly backed Theresa May (Conservative Party) over Jeremy Corbyn (Labour Party) while warning about her stance on immigration and the eurosceptic elements in her party.\n\nIn the U.S. presidential election in 2008 the \"Financial Times\" endorsed Barack Obama. While it raised concerns over hints of protectionism, it praised his ability to \"engage the country's attention,\" his calls for a bipartisan politics, and his plans for \"comprehensive health-care reform\". The \"FT\" favoured Obama again in 2012. The \"FT\" endorsed Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the run-up for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe Financial Times Group, a division of Pearson PLC since 1957, was sold in July 2015 to the Japanese company Nikkei for £844m. Until August 2015 the FT group had a 50% shareholding in \"The Economist\", which was sold to the Agnelli family for £469 million.\n\nRelated publications include the \"Financial Times\", FT.com, FT Search Inc., the publishing imprint FT Press and numerous joint ventures. In November 2013 it agreed to sell Mergermarket, an online intelligence reporting business, to the London private equity investor BC Partners. In addition, the FT Group has a unit called FT Specialist, which is a provider of specialist information on retail, personal and institutional finance segments. It publishes \"The Banker\", \"Money Management\" and \"Financial Adviser\" (a publication targeted at professional advisers), \"fDi Intelligence\" and \"Professional Wealth Management\" (PWM).\n\nThe Financial Times Group announced the beta launch of newssift, part of FT Search, in March 2009. Newssift.com is a next-generation search tool for business professionals that indexes millions of articles from thousands of global business news sources, not just the FT. The Financial Times Group acquired Money Media (an online news and commentary site for the industry) and Exec-Appointments (an online recruitment specialist site for the executive jobs market). The FT Group once had a 13.85% stake in Business Standard Ltd of India, the publisher of the Business Standard. It sold this stake in April 2008 and has entered into an agreement with Network 18 to launch the \"Financial Times\" in India, though it is speculated that they may find it difficult to do so, as the brand 'Financial Times' in India is owned by The Times Group, the publisher of \"The Times of India\" and \"The Economic Times\". The group also publishes America's Intelligence Wire, a daily general newswire service.\n\nThe \"Financial Times\"' Financial Publishing division (formerly FT Business) provides print and online content for retail, personal and institutional finance audiences. Examples of publications and services include: \"Investors Chronicle\", a personal finance magazine and website; \"FT Money\", a weekly personal finance supplement in \"FT Weekend\"; \"FT Wealth\", a magazine for the global high-net-worth community and FTfm, a weekly review of the global fund management industry, \"Money Management\" and \"Financial Adviser\" (a publication targeted at professional advisers). The institutional segment includes: \"The Banker\", \"This Is Africa\", \"fDi\" \"Intelligence\" and \"Professional Wealth Management\" (PWM). Money-Media, a separate arm of Financial Publishing, delivers a range of digital information services for fund management professionals around the globe, including: Ignites, Ignites Europe, Ignites Asia, FundFire and BoardIQ. Financial Publishing includes publications (\"Pensions Expert\" and \"Deutsche Pensions & Investmentnachrichten\") and events (\"Investment Expert\") for the European pensions industry. The group also publishes MandateWire, a financial information company that provides sales and market intelligence for investment professionals in North America, Europe and Asia.\n\nFT Knowledge is an associated company which offers educational products and services. FT Knowledge has offered the \"Introducing the City\" course (which is a series of Wednesday night lectures and seminars, as well as weekend events) during each autumn and spring since 2000.\n\nFT Predict is a prediction market contest hosted by the \"Financial Times\" that allows users to buy and sell contracts based on future financial, political, and news-driven events by spending fictional Financial Times Dollars (FT$). Based on the assumptions displayed in James Surowiecki's \"The Wisdom of Crowds\", this contest allows people to use prediction markets to observe future occurrences while competing for weekly and monthly prizes.\n\nThe \"Financial Times\" also ran a business-related game called \"In the Pink\" (a phrase meaning \"in good health\", also a reference to the colour of the newspaper and to the phrase \"in the red\" meaning to be making a loss). Each player was put in the virtual role of Chief Executive and the goal was to have the highest profit when the game closes. The winner of the game (the player who makes the highest profit) was to receive a real monetary prize of £10,000. The game ran from 1 May to 28 June 2006.\n\nThe \"Financial Times\" collates and publishes a number of financial market indices, which reflect the changing value of their constituent parts. The longest-running of these was the former \"Financial News Index\", started on 1 July 1935 by the \"Financial News\". The \"FT\" published a similar index; this was replaced by the \"Financial News Index\"—which was then renamed the \"Financial Times (FT) Index\"—on 1 January 1947. The index started as an index of industrial shares, and companies with dominant overseas interests were excluded, such as the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (later BP), British-American Tobacco, Lever Brothers (later Unilever) and Shell. The oil and financial sectors were included decades later.\n\nThe FTSE All-Share Index, the first of the FTSE series of indices, was created in 1962, comprising the largest 594 UK companies by market capitalisation. The letters F-T-S-E represented that FTSE was a joint venture between the Financial Times (F-T) and the London Stock Exchange (S-E). On 13 February 1984 the FTSE 100 was introduced, representing about eighty percent of the London Stock Exchange's value. In 1995 FTSE Group was made an independent company. The first of several overseas offices was opened in New York City in 1999; Paris followed in early 2000, Hong Kong, Frankfurt and San Francisco in 2001, Madrid in 2002 and Tokyo in 2003.\n\nOther well-known FTSE indices include the FTSE 350 Index, the FTSE SmallCap Index, the FTSE AIM UK 50 Index and FTSE AIM 100 Index as well as the FTSE AIM All-Share Index for stocks, and the FTSE UK Gilt Indices for government bonds.\n\n\nIn July 2006 the \"FT\" announced a \"New Newsroom\" project to integrate the newspaper more closely with FT.com. At the same time it announced plans to cut the editorial staff from 525 to 475. In August 2006 it announced that all the required job cuts had been achieved through voluntary layoffs.\n\nA number of former \"FT\" journalists have gone on to high-profile jobs in journalism, politics and business. Robert Thomson, previously the paper's US managing editor, was the editor of \"The Times\" and is now the publisher of the \"Wall Street Journal\". Will Lewis, a former New York correspondent and News Editor for the \"FT\", is the current editor of the \"Daily Telegraph\". Dominic Lawson went on to become editor of the \"Sunday Telegraph\" until he was sacked in 2005. Andrew Adonis, a former education correspondent, became an adviser on education to the then British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and was given a job as an education minister and a seat in the House of Lords after the 2005 election. Ed Balls became chief economic adviser to the Treasury, working closely with Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer (or finance minister), before being elected a Member of Parliament in 2005, and became Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families in July 2007. Bernard Gray, a former defence correspondent and Lex columnist, was chief executive of the publishing company CMP before becoming chief executive of TSL Education, publisher of the \"Times Educational Supplement\". David Jones, at one time the FT Night Editor, then became Head of IT. He was a key figure in the newspaper's transformation from hot metal to electronic composition and then onto full-page pagination in the 1990s. He went on to become Head of Technology for the Trinity Mirror Group.\n\nSir Geoffrey Owen was the editor of the \"Financial Times\" from 1981 to 1990. He joined the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics as Director of Business Policy in 1991 and was appointed Senior Fellow, Institute of Management, in 1997. He continues his work there. During his tenure at the FT he had to deal with rapid technological change and issues related to it, for example repetitive strain injury (RSI), which affected dozens of FT journalists, reporters and staff in the late 1980s.\n\n"}
{"id": "127071", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=127071", "title": "Le Monde", "text": "Le Monde\n\nLe Monde (; ) is a French daily afternoon newspaper founded by Hubert Beuve-Méry at the request of Charles de Gaulle (as Chairman of the Provisional Government of the French Republic) on 19 December 1944, shortly after the Liberation of Paris, and published continuously since its first edition.\n\n\"Le Monde\" is one of the French newspapers of record, counting also \"Libération\", and \"Le Figaro\", and the main publication of Le Monde Group. It reported an average circulation of 323,039 copies per issue in 2009, about 40,000 of which were sold abroad. It has had its own website since 19 December 1995, and is often the only French newspaper easily obtainable in non-French-speaking countries. It should not be confused with the monthly publication \"Le Monde diplomatique\", of which \"Le Monde\" has 51% ownership, but which is editorially independent.\n\nThe paper's journalistic side has a collegial form of organization, in which most journalists are not only tenured, but financial stakeholders in the enterprise as well, and participate in the elections of upper management and senior executives. In the 1990s and 2000s, La Vie-Le Monde Group expanded under editor Jean-Marie Colombani with a number of acquisitions. However, its profitability was not sufficient to cover the large debt loads it took on to fund this expansion, and it sought new investors in 2010 to keep the company out of bankruptcy. In June 2010, investors Matthieu Pigasse, Pierre Bergé, and Xavier Niel acquired a controlling stake in the newspaper.\n\nIn contrast to other world newspapers such as \"The New York Times\", \"Le Monde\" was traditionally focused on offering analysis and opinion, as opposed to being a newspaper of record. Hence, it was considered less important for the paper to offer maximum coverage of the news than to offer thoughtful interpretation of current events. For instance, on the 10th anniversary of the sinking of the \"Rainbow Warrior\", the newspaper directly implicated François Mitterrand, who was the French president at the time, in the operation. In recent years the paper has established a greater distinction between fact and opinion.\n\n\"Le Monde\" was founded in 1944 at the request of General Charles de Gaulle after the German army was driven from Paris during World War II, and took over the headquarters and layout of \"Le Temps\", which was the most important newspaper in France before but whose reputation had suffered during the Occupation. Beuve-Méry reportedly demanded total editorial independence as the condition for his taking on the project.\n\nIn 1981 it backed the election of socialist François Mitterrand, in part on the grounds that the alternation of the political party in government would be beneficial to the democratic character of the state. The paper endorsed centre-right candidate Édouard Balladur in the 1995 presidential election, and Ségolène Royal, the Socialist Party candidate, in the 2007 presidential election.\n\nAccording to the Mitrokhin Archive investigators, \"Le Monde\" (KGB codename VESTNIK, \"messenger\") was the KGB's key outlet for Soviet disinformation in the French media. The archive identified two senior \"Le Monde\" journalists and several contributors who were used in the operations (see also the article on Russian influence operations in France).\n\nMichel Legris, a former journalist with the paper, wrote \"Le Monde tel qu'il est\" (\"Le Monde as it is\") in 1976. According to him, the journal minimized the atrocities committed by the Cambodian Khmer Rouge.\n\nIn their 2003 book titled \"La Face cachée du Monde\" (\"The Hidden face of \"Le Monde\"\"), authors Pierre Péan and Philippe Cohen alleged that Colombani and then-editor Edwy Plenel had shown, amongst other things, partisan bias and had engaged in financial dealings that compromised the paper's independence. It also accused the paper of dangerously damaging the authority of the French state by having revealed various political scandals (notably corruption scandals surrounding Jacques Chirac, the \"Irish of Vincennes\" affair, and the sinking of a Greenpeace boat, the \"Rainbow Warrior\", by French intelligence under President François Mitterrand). This book remains controversial, but attracted much attention and media coverage in France and around the world at the time of its publication. Following a lawsuit, the authors and the publisher agreed in 2004 not to proceed to any reprinting.\n\n\"Le Monde\" has been found guilty of defamation for saying that Spanish football club FC Barcelona was connected to a doctor involved in steroid use. The Spanish court fined the newspaper nearly $450,000.\n\nIn April 2016, a \"Le Monde\" reporter was denied a visa to visit Algeria as part of the French Prime Minister press convoy to Algeria. \"Le Monde\" had previously published names of Algerian officials directly involved with the Panama papers corruption scandal.\n\nIn June 2010, investors Matthieu Pigasse, Pierre Bergé, and Xavier Niel acquired a controlling stake in the newspaper. In October 2018, staff learned that Pigasse had sold 49% of his stake in the company to Czech businessman Daniel Křetínský. \"Le Monde\"'s Independency Group, a minority shareholder that aims to protect the paper's editorial independence, had not been informed of the sale, and asked Pigasse and Křetínský to sign an \"approval agreement\" that would give the Independency Group the right to approve or reject any controlling shareholder. , they had not done so.\n\n\"Le Monde\" is published around midday, and the date on the masthead is the following day's. For instance, the issue released at midday on 15 March shows 16 March on the masthead. It is available on newsstands in France on the day of release, and received by mail subscribers on the masthead date. The Saturday issue is a double one, for Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThus the latest edition can be found on newsstands from Monday to Friday included, while subscribers will receive it from Tuesday to Saturday included.\n\nIn December 2006, on the 60th anniversary of its publishing début, \"Le Monde\" moved into new headquarters in Boulevard Auguste-Blanqui, 13th arrondissement of Paris.\n\nThe building—formerly the headquarters of Air France—was refashioned by Bouygues from the designs of Christian de Portzamparc. The building's façade has an enormous fresco adorned by doves (drawn by Plantu) flying towards Victor Hugo, symbolising freedom of the press.\n\nIt will move into a new headquarters, also in the 13th arrondissement, around 2017. It will have space for 1,200 people.\n\nLe Monde has been present on the Internet with its own domain name (lemonde.fr) since 19 December 1995. In 2017 online version of the \"Le Monde\" was among the ten most cited sources in the French Wikipedia. Currently LeMonde.fr is included in top 50 most visited websites in France.\n\nStarting in the 2000s \"Le Monde\" allowed its subscribers to publish a blog on its website. These blogs were called the “les blogs abonnées du Monde.fr”. On April 10, 2019, \"Le Monde\" announced that it would be closing its blog platform on June 5, 2019. Although the reasons for the closing of the blogs were unclear, it could be linked to the dominance of social networks like Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "38443676", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=38443676", "title": "Pravda", "text": "Pravda\n\nPravda (, \"Truth\") is a Russian broadsheet newspaper, formerly the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, when it was one of the most influential papers in the country with a circulation of 11 million. The newspaper began publication on 5 May 1912 in the Russian Empire, but was already extant abroad in January 1911. It emerged as a leading newspaper of the Soviet Union after the October Revolution. The newspaper was an organ of the Central Committee of the CPSU between 1912 and 1991.\n\nAfter the dissolution of the Soviet Union \"Pravda\" was sold off by Russian President Boris Yeltsin to a Greek business family in 1996, and the paper came under the control of their private company Pravda International.\n\nIn 1996, there was an internal dispute between the owners of Pravda International and some of the \"Pravda\" journalists which led to Pravda splitting into different entities. The Communist Party of the Russian Federation acquired the \"Pravda\" paper, while some of the original Pravda journalists separated to form Russia's first online paper (and the first online English paper) \"Pravda.ru\", which is not connected to the Communist Party. After a legal dispute between the rival parties, the Russian court of arbitration stipulated that both entities would be allowed to continue using the Pravda name.\n\nThe \"Pravda\" paper is today run by the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, whereas the online Pravda.ru is privately owned and has international editions published in Russian, English, French and Portuguese.\n\nThough \"Pravda\" officially began publication on 5 May 1912 (22 April 1912 OS), the anniversary of Karl Marx's birth, its origins trace back to 1903 when it was founded in Moscow by a wealthy railway engineer, V.A. Kozhevnikov. \"Pravda\" had started publishing in the light of the Russian Revolution of 1905.\n\nDuring its earliest days, \"Pravda\" had no political orientation. Kozhevnikov started it as a journal of arts, literature and social life. Kozhevnikov was soon able to form up a team of young writers including A.A. Bogdanov, N.A Rozhkov, M.N Pokrovsky, I.I Skvortsov-Stepanov, P.P Rumyantsev and M.G. Lunts, who were active contributors on 'social life' section of \"Pravda\". Later they became the editorial board of the journal and in the near future also became the active members of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). Because of certain quarrels between Kozhevnikov and the editorial board, he had asked them to leave and the Menshevik faction of the RSDLP took over as Editorial Board. But the relationship between them and Kozhevnikov was also a bitter one.\n\nThe Ukrainian political party Spilka, which was also a splinter group of the RSDLP, took over the journal as its organ. Leon Trotsky was invited to edit the paper in 1908 and the paper was finally moved to Vienna in 1909. By then, the editorial board of \"Pravda\" consisted of hard-line Bolsheviks who sidelined the Spilka leadership soon after it shifted to Vienna. Trotsky had introduced a tabloid format to the newspaper and distanced itself from the intra-party struggles inside the RSDLP. During those days, \"Pravda\" gained a large audience among Russian workers. By 1910 the Central Committee of the RSDLP suggested making \"Pravda\" its official organ.\nFinally, at the sixth conference of the RSDLP held in Prague in January 1912, the Menshevik faction was expelled from the party. The party under the leadership of Vladimir Lenin decided to make \"Pravda\" its official mouthpiece. The paper was shifted from Vienna to St. Petersburg and the first issue under Lenin's leadership was published on 5 May 1912 (22 April 1912 OS). It was the first time that \"Pravda\" was published as a legal political newspaper. The Central Committee of the RSDLP, workers and individuals such as Maxim Gorky provided financial help to the newspaper. The first issue published on 5 May cost two kopeks and had four pages. It had articles on economic issues, workers movement, and strikes, and also had two proletarian poems. M.E. Egorov was the first editor of St. Petersburg \"Pravda\" and Member of Duma N.G. Poletaev served as its publisher.\n\nEgorov was not a real editor of \"Pravda\" but this position was pseudo in nature. As many as 42 editors had followed Egorov within a span of two years, till 1914. The main task of these editors was to go to jail whenever needed and to save the party from a huge fine. On the publishing side, the party had chosen only those individuals as publishers who were sitting members of Duma because they had parliamentary immunity. Initially, it had sold between 40,000 and 60,000 copies. The paper was closed down by tsarist censorship in July 1914. Over the next two years, it changed its name eight times because of police harassment:\n\nThe overthrow of Tsar Nicholas II by the February Revolution of 1917 allowed \"Pravda\" to reopen. The original editors of the newly reincarnated \"Pravda\", Vyacheslav Molotov and Alexander Shlyapnikov, were opposed to the liberal Russian Provisional Government. However, when Lev Kamenev, Joseph Stalin and former Duma deputy Matvei Muranov returned from Siberian exile on 12 March, they took over the editorial board – starting with 15 March.\nUnder Kamenev's and Stalin's influence, \"Pravda\" took a conciliatory tone towards the Provisional Government—\"insofar as it struggles against reaction or counter-revolution\"—and called for a unification conference with the internationalist wing of the Mensheviks. On 14 March, Kamenev wrote in his first editorial:\n\nOn 15 March, he supported the war effort:\n\nThe offices of the newspaper were transferred to Moscow on 3 March 1918 when the Soviet capital was moved there. \"Pravda\" became an official publication, or \"organ\", of the Soviet Communist Party. \"Pravda\" became the conduit for announcing official policy and policy changes and would remain so until 1991. Subscription to \"Pravda\" was mandatory for state run companies, the armed services and other organizations until 1989.\n\nOther newspapers existed as organs of other state bodies. For example, \"Izvestia\", which covered foreign relations, was the organ of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, \"Trud\" was the organ of the trade union movement, \"Bednota\" was distributed to the Red Army and rural peasants. Various derivatives of the name \"Pravda\" were used both for a number of national newspapers (\"Komsomolskaya Pravda\" was the organ of the Komsomol organization, and \"Pionerskaya Pravda\" was the organ of the Young Pioneers), and for the regional Communist Party newspapers in many republics and provinces of the USSR, e.g. \"Kazakhstanskaya Pravda\" in Kazakhstan, \"Polyarnaya Pravda\" in Murmansk Oblast, \"Pravda Severa\" in Arkhangelsk Oblast, or \"Moskovskaya Pravda\" in the city of Moscow.\n\nShortly after the October 1917 Revolution, Nikolai Bukharin became the Editor of \"Pravda\". Bukharin's apprenticeship for this position had occurred during the last months of his emigration/exile prior to Bukharin's return to Russia in April 1917. These months from November 1916 until April 1917 were spent by Bukharin in New York City in the United States. In New York, Bukharin divided his time between the local libraries and his work for \"Novyj Mir\" (The New World) a Russian language newspaper serving the Russian speaking community of New York. Bukharin's involvement with \"Novyj Mir\" became deeper as time went by. Indeed, from January 1917 until April when he returned to Russia, Bukharin served as \"de facto\" Editor of \"Novyj Mir\".Z In the period after the death of Lenin in 1924, \"Pravda\" was to form a power base for Nikolai Bukharin, one of the rival party leaders, who edited the newspaper, which helped him reinforce his reputation as a Marxist theoretician. Bukharin would continue to serve as Editor of \"Pravda\" until he and Mikhail Tomsky were removed from their responsibilities at \"Pravda\" in February 1929 as part of their downfall as a result of their dispute with Joseph Stalin.\n\nA number of places and things in the Soviet Union were named after \"Pravda\". Among them was the city of Pravdinsk in Gorky Oblast (the home of a paper mill producing much newsprint for \"Pravda\" and other national newspapers), and a number of streets and collective farms.\n\nAs the names of the main Communist newspaper and the main Soviet newspaper, \"Pravda\" and \"Izvestia\", meant \"the truth\" and \"the news\" respectively, a popular saying was \"there's no truth in Pravda and no news in Izvestia\".\n\n\"Pravda\" was closed down for a brief period on 30 July 1996. Some of \"Pravda\"s journalists established their own English language online newspaper known as \"Pravda Online\". \"Pravda\" is witnessing hard times and the number of its staff members and print run has been significantly reduced. During the Soviet era it was a daily newspaper but today it publishes three times a week.\n\n\"Pravda\" still operates from the same headquarters at Pravda Street from where journalists used to prepare \"Pravda\" every day during the Soviet era. It operates under the leadership of journalist Boris Komotsky. A function was organised by the CPRF on 5 July 2012 to celebrate 100 years since the publication of the first official issue of \"Pravda\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "39127", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=39127", "title": "The Times", "text": "The Times\n\nThe Times is a British daily (Monday to Saturday) national newspaper based in London. It began in 1785 under the title The Daily Universal Register, adopting its current name on 1 January 1788. \"The Times\" and its sister paper \"The Sunday Times\" (founded in 1821) are published by Times Newspapers, since 1981 a subsidiary of News UK, in turn wholly owned by News Corp. \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" do not share editorial staff, were founded independently, and have only had common ownership since 1967.\n\nIn 1959, the historian of journalism Allan Nevins analysed the importance of \"The Times\" in shaping the views of events of London's elite:\n\nFor much more than a century \"The Times\" has been an integral and important part of the political structure of Great Britain. Its news and its editorial comment have in general been carefully coordinated, and have at most times been handled with an earnest sense of responsibility. While the paper has admitted some trivia to its columns, its whole emphasis has been on important public affairs treated with an eye to the best interests of Britain. To guide this treatment, the editors have for long periods been in close touch with 10 Downing Street.\n\n\"The Times\" is the first newspaper to have borne that name, lending it to numerous other papers around the world, such as \"The Times of India\" and \"The New York Times\". In countries where these other titles are popular, the newspaper is often referred to as or , although the newspaper is of national scope and distribution.\n\n\"The Times\" is the originator of the widely used Times New Roman typeface, originally developed by Stanley Morison of \"The Times\" in collaboration with the Monotype Corporation for its legibility in low-tech printing. In November 2006 \"The Times\" began printing headlines in a new font, Times Modern. \"The Times\" was printed in broadsheet format for 219 years, but switched to compact size in 2004 in an attempt to appeal more to younger readers and commuters using public transport. \"The Sunday Times\" remains a broadsheet.\n\n\"The Times\" had an average daily circulation of 417,298 in January 2019; in the same period, \"The Sunday Times\" had an average weekly circulation of 712,291. An American edition of \"The Times\" has been published since 6 June 2006. \"The Times\" has been heavily used by scholars and researchers because of its widespread availability in libraries and its detailed index. A complete historical file of the digitised paper, up to 2010, is online from Gale Cengage Learning.\n\n\"The Times\" was founded by publisher John Walter on 1 January 1785 as \"The Daily Universal Register,\" with Walter in the role of editor. Walter had lost his job by the end of 1784 after the insurance company where he worked went bankrupt due to losses from a Jamaican hurricane. Unemployed, Walter began a new business venture. At that time, Henry Johnson invented the logography, a new typography that was reputedly faster and more precise (although three years later, it was proved less efficient than advertised). Walter bought the logography's patent and with it opened a printing house to produce books. The first publication of the newspaper \"The Daily Universal Register\" was on 1 January 1785. Walter changed the title after 940 editions on 1 January 1788 to \"The Times\". In 1803, Walter handed ownership and editorship to his son of the same name. In spite of Walter Sr's sixteen-month stay in Newgate Prison for libel printed in \"The Times\", his pioneering efforts to obtain Continental news, especially from France, helped build the paper's reputation among policy makers and financiers.\n\n\"The Times\" used contributions from significant figures in the fields of politics, science, literature, and the arts to build its reputation. For much of its early life, the profits of \"The Times\" were very large and the competition minimal, so it could pay far better than its rivals for information or writers. Beginning in 1814, the paper was printed on the new steam-driven cylinder press developed by Friedrich Koenig. In 1815, \"The Times\" had a circulation of 5,000.\n\nThomas Barnes was appointed general editor in 1817. In the same year, the paper's printer James Lawson, died and passed the business onto his son John Joseph Lawson (1802–1852). Under the editorship of Barnes and his successor in 1841, John Thadeus Delane, the influence of \"The Times\" rose to great heights, especially in politics and amongst the City of London. Peter Fraser and Edward Sterling were two noted journalists, and gained for \"The Times\" the pompous/satirical nickname 'The Thunderer' (from \"We thundered out the other day an article on social and political reform.\"). The increased circulation and influence of the paper was based in part to its early adoption of the steam-driven rotary printing press. Distribution via steam trains to rapidly growing concentrations of urban populations helped ensure the profitability of the paper and its growing influence.\n\n\"The Times\" was one of the first newspapers to send war correspondents to cover particular conflicts. William Howard Russell, the paper's correspondent with the army in the Crimean War, was immensely influential with his dispatches back to England.\n\n\"The Times\" faced financial extinction in 1890 under Arthur Fraser Walter, but it was rescued by an energetic editor, Charles Frederic Moberly Bell. During his tenure (1890–1911), \"The Times\" became associated with selling the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\" using aggressive American marketing methods introduced by Horace Everett Hooper and his advertising executive, Henry Haxton. Due to legal fights between the \"Britannica's\" two owners, Hooper and Walter Montgomery Jackson, \"The Times\" severed its connection in 1908 and was bought by pioneering newspaper magnate, Alfred Harmsworth, later Lord Northcliffe.\n\nIn editorials published on 29 and 31 July 1914, Wickham Steed, the \"Times's\" Chief Editor, argued that the British Empire should enter World War I. On 8 May 1920, also under the editorship of Steed, \"The Times\" in an editorial endorsed the anti-Semitic fabrication \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\" as a genuine document, and called Jews the world's greatest danger. In the leader entitled \"The Jewish Peril, a Disturbing Pamphlet: Call for Inquiry\", Steed wrote about \"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\": What are these 'Protocols'? Are they authentic? If so, what malevolent assembly concocted these plans and gloated over their exposition? Are they forgery? If so, whence comes the uncanny note of prophecy, prophecy in part fulfilled, in part so far gone in the way of fulfillment?\". The following year, when Philip Graves, the Constantinople (modern Istanbul) correspondent of \"The Times\", exposed \"The Protocols\" as a forgery, \"The Times\" retracted the editorial of the previous year.\n\nIn 1922, John Jacob Astor, son of the 1st Viscount Astor, bought \"The Times\" from the Northcliffe estate. The paper gained a measure of notoriety in the 1930s with its advocacy of German appeasement; editor Geoffrey Dawson was closely allied with those in the government who practised appeasement, most notably Neville Chamberlain. Candid news reports by Norman Ebbut from Berlin that warned of warmongering were rewritten in London to support the appeasement policy.\n\nKim Philby, a double agent with primary allegiance to the Soviet Union, was a correspondent for the newspaper in Spain during the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930s. Philby was admired for his courage in obtaining high-quality reporting from the front lines of the bloody conflict. He later joined British Military Intelligence (MI6) during World War II, was promoted into senior positions after the war ended, and defected to the Soviet Union when discovery was inevitable in 1963.\nBetween 1941 and 1946, the left-wing British historian E. H. Carr was assistant editor. Carr was well known for the strongly pro-Soviet tone of his editorials. In December 1944, when fighting broke out in Athens between the Greek Communist ELAS and the British Army, Carr in a \"Times\" leader sided with the Communists, leading Winston Churchill to condemn him and the article in a speech to the House of Commons. As a result of Carr's editorial, \"The Times\" became popularly known during that stage of World War II as \"the threepenny \"Daily Worker\"\" (the price of the Communist Party's \"Daily Worker\" being one penny).\n\nOn 3 May 1966 it resumed printing news on the front page – previously the front page had been given over to small advertisements, usually of interest to the moneyed classes in British society. Also in 1966, the Royal Arms, which had been a feature of the newspaper's masthead since its inception, was abandoned. In 1967 members of the Astor family sold the paper to Canadian publishing magnate Roy Thomson. His Thomson Corporation brought it under the same ownership as \"The Sunday Times\" to form Times Newspapers Limited.\n\nAn industrial dispute prompted the management to shut the paper for nearly a year from 1 December 1978 to 12 November 1979.\n\nThe Thomson Corporation management were struggling to run the business due to the 1979 energy crisis and union demands. Management sought a buyer who was in a position to guarantee the survival of both titles, and had the resources and was committed to funding the introduction of modern printing methods.\n\nSeveral suitors appeared, including Robert Maxwell, Tiny Rowland and Lord Rothermere; however, only one buyer was in a position to meet the full Thomson remit, Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch. Robert Holmes à Court, another Australian magnate had previously tried to buy \"The Times\" in 1980.\n\nIn 1981, \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" were bought from Thomson by Rupert Murdoch's News International. The acquisition followed three weeks of intensive bargaining with the unions by company negotiators John Collier and Bill O'Neill. Murdoch gave legal undertakings to maintain separate journalism resources for the two titles. The Royal Arms was reintroduced to the masthead at about this time, but whereas previously it had been that of the reigning monarch, it would now be that of the House of Hanover, who were on the throne when the newspaper was founded.\n\nAfter 14 years as editor, William Rees-Mogg resigned upon completion of the change of ownership. Murdoch began to make his mark on the paper by appointing Harold Evans as his replacement. One of his most important changes was the introduction of new technology and efficiency measures. Between March 1981 and May 1982, following agreement with print unions, the hot-metal Linotype printing process used to print \"The Times\" since the 19th century was phased out and replaced by computer input and photo-composition. This allowed print room staff at \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" to be reduced by half. However, direct input of text by journalists (\"single-stroke\" input) was still not achieved, and this was to remain an interim measure until the Wapping dispute of 1986, when \"The Times\" moved from New Printing House Square in Gray's Inn Road (near Fleet Street) to new offices in Wapping.\n\nRobert Fisk, seven times British International Journalist of the Year, resigned as foreign correspondent in 1988 over what he saw as \"political censorship\" of his article on the shooting-down of Iran Air Flight 655 in July 1988. He wrote in detail about his reasons for resigning from the paper due to meddling with his stories, and the paper's pro-Israel stance.\n\nIn the In June 1990 \"The Times\" ceased its policy of using courtesy titles (\"Mr\", \"Mrs\", or \"Miss\" prefixes) for living persons before full names on first reference, but it continues to use them before surnames on subsequent references. In 1992 it accepted the use of \"Ms\" for unmarried women \"if they express a preference.\"\n\nIn November 2003, News International began producing the newspaper in both broadsheet and tabloid sizes. Over the next year, the broadsheet edition was withdrawn from Northern Ireland, Scotland, and the West Country. Since 1 November 2004, the paper has been printed solely in tabloid format.\n\nOn 6 June 2005, \"The Times\" redesigned its Letters page, dropping the practice of printing correspondents' full postal addresses. Published letters were long regarded as one of the paper's key constituents. According to its leading article \"From Our Own Correspondents\", the reason for removal of full postal addresses was to fit more letters onto the page.\n\nIn a 2007 meeting with the House of Lords Select Committee on Communications, which was investigating media ownership and the news, Murdoch stated that the law and the independent board prevented him from exercising editorial control.\n\nIn May 2008 printing of \"The Times\" switched from Wapping to new plants at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, and Merseyside and Glasgow, enabling the paper to be produced with full colour on every page for the first time.\n\nOn 26 July 2012, to coincide with the official start of the London 2012 Olympics and the issuing of a series of souvenir front covers, \"The Times\" added the suffix \"of London\" to its masthead.\n\nIn March 2016, the paper dropped its rolling digital coverage for a series of 'editions' of the paper at 9am, midday and 5pm on weekday. The change also saw a redesign for the paper's app for smartphones and tablets.\n\nIn April 2019, Culture secretary Jeremy Wright said he was minded to allow a request by News UK to relax the legal undertakings given in 1981 to maintain separate journalism resources for \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\".\n\n\"The Times\" features news for the first half of the paper; the Opinion/Comment section begins after the first news section with world news normally following this. The business pages begin on the centre spread, and are followed by The Register, containing obituaries, a Court & Social section, and related material. The sport section is at the end of the main paper. In April 2016, the cover price of \"The Times\" became £1.40 on weekdays and £1.50 on Saturdays.\n\n\"The Times\" main supplement, every day, is the \"times2\", featuring various columns. It was discontinued in early March 2010 but reintroduced on 12 October 2010 after discontinuation was criticised. Its regular features include a puzzles section called \"Mind Games\". Its previous incarnation began on 5 September 2005, before which it was called \"T2\" and previously \"Times 2\". The supplement contains arts and lifestyle features, TV and radio listings, and theatre reviews. The newspaper employs Richard Morrison as its classical music critic.\n\"The Game\" is included in the newspaper on Mondays, and details all the weekend's football activity (Premier League and Football League Championship, League One and League Two.) The Scottish edition of \"The Game\" also includes results and analysis from Scottish Premier League games. During the FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euros there is a daily supplement of The Game.\n\nThe Saturday edition of \"The Times\" contains a variety of supplements. These supplements were relaunched in January 2009 as: \"Sport\", \"Weekend\" (including travel and lifestyle features), \"Saturday Review\" (arts, books, TV listings and ideas), \"The Times Magazine\" (columns on various topics), and \"Playlist\" (an entertainment listings guide).\n\n\"The Times Magazine\" features columns touching on various subjects such as celebrities, fashion and beauty, food and drink, homes and gardens or simply writers' anecdotes. Notable contributors include Giles Coren, Food and Drink Writer of the Year in 2005 and Nadiya Hussain, winner of BBC's The Great British Bake Off.\n\n\"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" have had an online presence since March 1999, originally at \"the-times.co.uk\" and \"sunday-times.co.uk\", and later at \"timesonline.co.uk\". There are now two websites: \"thetimes.co.uk\" is aimed at daily readers, and the \"thesundaytimes.co.uk\" site at providing weekly magazine-like content. There are also iPad and Android editions of both newspapers. Since July 2010, News UK has required readers who do not subscribe to the print edition to pay £2 per week to read \"The Times\" and \"The Sunday Times\" online.\n\nVisits to the websites have decreased by 87% since the paywall was introduced, from 21 million unique users per month to 2.7 million. In April 2009, the \"timesonline\" site had a readership of 750,000 readers per day. In October 2011 there were around 111,000 subscribers to \"The Times\" digital products.\n\n\"The Times\" has had the following eight owners since its foundation in 1785:\n\n\nAt the time of Harold Evans' appointment as editor in 1981, \"The Times\" had an average daily sale of 282,000 copies in comparison to the 1.4 million daily sales of its traditional rival \"The Daily Telegraph\". By November 2005 \"The Times\" sold an average of 691,283 copies per day, the second-highest of any British \"quality\" newspaper (after \"The Daily Telegraph\", which had a circulation of 903,405 copies in the period), and the highest in terms of full-rate sales. By March 2014, average daily circulation of \"The Times\" had fallen to 394,448 copies, compared to \"The Daily Telegraph\"'s 523,048, with the two retaining respectively the second-highest and highest circulations among British \"quality\" newspapers. In contrast \"The Sun\", the highest-selling \"tabloid\" daily newspaper in the United Kingdom, sold an average of 2,069,809 copies in March 2014, and the \"Daily Mail\", the highest-selling \"middle market\" British daily newspaper, sold an average of 1,708,006 copies in the period.\n\n\"The Sunday Times\" has a significantly higher circulation than \"The Times\", and sometimes outsells \"The Sunday Telegraph\". In January 2019 \"The Times\" had a circulation of 417,298 and \"The Sunday Times\" 712,291.\n\nIn a 2009 national readership survey \"The Times\" was found to have the highest number of ABC1 25–44 readers and the largest numbers of readers in London of any of the \"quality\" papers.\n\nIn 1908, \"The Times\" started using the \"Monotype Modern\" typeface.\n\n\"The Times\" commissioned the serif typeface \"Times New Roman\", created by Victor Lardent at the English branch of Monotype, in 1931. It was commissioned after Stanley Morison had written an article criticizing \"The Times\" for being badly printed and typographically antiquated. The font was supervised by Morison and drawn by Victor Lardent, an artist from the advertising department of \"The Times\". Morison used an older font named Plantin as the basis for his design, but made revisions for legibility and economy of space. \"Times New Roman\" made its debut in the issue of 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. \"The Times\" stayed with \"Times New Roman\" for 40 years, but new production techniques and the format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004 have caused the newspaper to switch font five times since 1972. However, all the new fonts have been variants of the original New Roman font:\n\nHistorically, the paper was not overtly pro-Tory or Whig, but has been a long time bastion of the English Establishment and empire. \"The Times\" adopted a stance described as \"peculiarly detached\" at the 1945 general election; although it was increasingly critical of the Conservative Party's campaign, it did not advocate a vote for any one party. However, the newspaper reverted to the Tories for the next election five years later. It supported the Conservatives for the subsequent three elections, followed by support for both the Conservatives and the Liberal Party for the next five elections, expressly supporting a Con-Lib coalition in 1974. The paper then backed the Conservatives solidly until 1997, when it declined to make any party endorsement but supported individual (primarily Eurosceptic) candidates.\n\nFor the 2001 general election \"The Times\" declared its support for Tony Blair's Labour government, which was re-elected by a landslide (although not as large as in 1997). It supported Labour again in 2005, when Labour achieved a third successive win, though with a reduced majority. In 2004, according to MORI, the voting intentions of its readership were 40% for the Conservative Party, 29% for the Liberal Democrats, and 26% for Labour. For the 2010 general election, the newspaper declared its support for the Conservatives once again; the election ended in the Tories taking the most votes and seats but having to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats in order to form a government as they had failed to gain an overall majority.\n\nThis makes it the most varied newspaper in terms of political support in British history. Some columnists in \"The Times\" are connected to the Conservative Party such as Daniel Finkelstein, Tim Montgomerie, Matthew Parris and Matt Ridley, but there are also columnists connected to the Labour Party such as David Aaronovitch, Philip Collins, and Jenni Russell.\n\n\"The Times\" occasionally makes endorsements for foreign elections. In November 2012, it endorsed a second term for Democrat Barack Obama although it also expressed reservations about his foreign policy.\n\nDuring the 2019 Conservative leadership election, \"The Times\" endorsed Boris Johnson.\n\n\"The Times\", along with the British Film Institute, sponsors \"The Times\" \"bfi\" London Film Festival. It also sponsors the Cheltenham Literature Festival and the Asia House Festival of Asian Literature at Asia House, London.\nAn Irish digital edition of the paper was launched in September 2015 at TheTimes.ie. A print edition was launched in June 2017, replacing the international edition previously distributed in Ireland. The Irish edition was set to close in June 2019 with the loss of 20 jobs.\n\n\"The Times Literary Supplement\" (\"TLS\") first appeared in 1902 as a supplement to \"The Times\", becoming a separately paid-for weekly literature and society magazine in 1914. The \"TLS\" is owned and published by News International and co-operates closely with \"The Times\", with its online version hosted on \"The Times\" website, and its editorial offices based in Times House, Pennington Street, London.\n\nBetween 1951 and 1966, \"The Times\" published a separately paid-for quarterly science review, \"The Times Science Review\". \"The Times\" started a new, free, monthly science magazine, \"Eureka\", in October 2009. The magazine closed in October 2012.\n\nTimes Atlases have been produced since 1895. They are currently produced by the Collins Bartholomew imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. The flagship product is \"The Times Comprehensive Atlas of the World\".\n\nIn 1971, \"The Times\" began publishing the \"Times Higher Education Supplement\" (now known as the \"Times Higher Education\") which focuses its coverage on tertiary education.\n\nIn the dystopian future world of George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", \"The Times\" has been transformed into an organ of the totalitarian ruling party. The book's lead character Winston Smith is employed in the task of rewriting past issues of the newspaper for the Ministry of Truth.\n\nRex Stout's fictional detective Nero Wolfe is described as fond of solving the London \"Times\" crossword puzzle at his New York home, in preference to those of American papers.\n\nIn the James Bond series by Ian Fleming, James Bond reads \"The Times\". As described by Fleming in \"From Russia, with Love\": \"The Times\" was \"the only paper that Bond ever read.\"\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "226804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=226804", "title": "The Times of India", "text": "The Times of India\n\nThe Times of India (TOI) is an Indian English-language daily newspaper owned by The Times Group. \nIt is the third-largest newspaper in India by circulation and the second-largest selling English-language daily in the world according to Audit Bureau of Circulations (India). It is the oldest English-language newspaper in India still in circulation, albeit under different names since its first edition published in 1838. It is also the second-oldest Indian newspaper still in circulation after the \"Bombay Samachar\".\n\nNear the beginning of the 20th century, Lord Curzon, the Viceroy of India, called \"The Times of India\" \"the leading paper in Asia\". In 1991, the BBC ranked \"The Times of India\" among the world's six best newspapers.\n\nIt is owned and published by Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. (B.C.C.L.), which is owned by the Sahu Jain family. In the Brand Trust Report 2012, \"The Times of India\" was ranked 88th among India's most-trusted brands. In 2017, however, the newspaper was ranked 355th.\n\n\"The Times of India\" issued its first edition on 3 November 1838 as The Bombay Times and Journal of Commerce. The paper published Wednesdays and Saturdays under the direction of Raobahadur Narayan Dinanath Velkar, a Maharashtrian Reformist, and contained news from Britain and the world, as well as the Indian Subcontinent. J.E. Brennan was its first editor. In 1850, it began to publish daily editions.\n\nIn 1860, editor Robert Knight (1825–1892) bought the Indian shareholders' interests, merged with rival \"Bombay Standard\", and started India's first news agency. It wired \"Times\" dispatches to papers across the country and became the Indian agent for Reuters news service. In 1861, he changed the name from the Bombay \"Times and Standard\" to \"The Times of India.\" Knight fought for a press free of prior restraint or intimidation, frequently resisting the attempts by governments, business interests, and cultural spokesmen and led the paper to national prominence. In the 19th century, this newspaper company employed more than 800 people and had a sizeable circulation in India and Europe.\n\nSubsequently, \"The Times of India\" saw its ownership change several times until 1892 when an English journalist named Thomas Jewell Bennett along with Frank Morris Coleman (who later drowned in the 1915 sinking of the SS \"Persia\") acquired the newspaper through their new joint stock company, \"Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd\".\n\nSir Stanley Reed edited \"The Times of India\" from 1907 until 1924 and received correspondence from the major figures of India such as Mahatma Gandhi. In all he lived in India for fifty years. He was respected in the United Kingdom as an expert on Indian current affairs. He christened Jaipur as \"the Pink City of India\".\n\nBennett Coleman & Co. Ltd was sold to sugar magnate Ramkrishna Dalmia of the then-famous industrial family, the Dalmiyas, for in 1946, as India was becoming independent and the British owners were leaving. In 1955 the Vivian Bose Commission of Inquiry found that Ramkrishna Dalmia, in 1947, had engineered the acquisition of the media giant Bennett Coleman & Co. by transferring money from a bank and an insurance company of which he was the Chairman.\nIn the court case that followed, Ramkrishna Dalmia was sentenced to two years in Tihar Jail after having been convicted of embezzlement and fraud.\n\nBut for most of the jail term he managed to spend in hospital. Upon his release, his son-in-law, Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain, to whom he had entrusted the running of Bennett, Coleman & Co. Ltd. rebuffed his efforts to resume command of the company.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Shanti Prasad Jain was imprisoned on charges of selling newsprint on the black market. And based on the Vivian Bose Commission's earlier report which found wrongdoings of the Dalmia – Jain group, that included specific charges against Shanti Prasad Jain, the Government of India filed a petition to restrain and remove the management of Bennett, Coleman and Company. Based on the pleading, Justice directed the Government to assume control of the newspaper which resulted in replacing half of the directors and appointing a Bombay (now Mumbai) High Court judge as the Chairman.\n\nFollowing the Vivian Bose Commission report indicating serious wrongdoings of the Dalmia–Jain group, on 28 August 1969, the Bombay High Court, under Justice J. L. Nain, passed an interim order to disband the existing board of Bennett Coleman and to constitute a new board under the Government. The bench ruled that \"Under these circumstances, the best thing would be to pass such orders on the assumption that the allegations made by the petitioners that the affairs of the company were being conducted in a manner prejudicial to public interest and to the interests of the Company are correct\". Following that order, Shanti Prasad Jain ceased to be a director and the company ran with new directors on board, appointed by the Government of India, with the exception of a lone stenographer of the Jains. Curiously, the court appointed D K Kunte as Chairman of the Board. Kunte had no prior business experience and was also an opposition member of the Lok Sabha.\n\nIn 1976, during the Emergency in India, the Government transferred ownership of the newspaper back to Ashok Kumar Jain (Sahu Shanti Prasad Jain's son, Ramkrishna Dalmia's grandson and the father of Samir Jain and Vineet Jain). The Jains too often landed themselves in various money laundering scams and Ashok Kumar Jain had to flee the country when the Enforcement Directorate pursued his case strongly in 1998 for alleged violations of illegal transfer of funds (to the tune of US$1.25 million) to an overseas account in Switzerland.<ref name=\"Mahalingam flonnet&rdurl=fl1515/15151170.htm\"></ref>\n\nOn 26 June 1975, the day after India declared a state of emergency, the Bombay edition of \"The Times of India\" carried an entry in its obituary column that read \"D.E.M. O'Cracy, beloved husband of T.Ruth, father of L.I.Bertie, brother of Faith, Hope and Justice expired on 25 June\". The move was a critique of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's 21-month state of emergency, which is now widely known as \"the Emergency\" and seen by many as a roundly authoritarian era of Indian government.\n\nIn late 2006, Times Group acquired Vijayanand Printers Limited (VPL). VPL previously published two Kannada newspapers, \"Vijay Karnataka\" and \"Usha Kiran\", and an English daily, \"Vijay Times\". \"Vijay Karnataka\" was the leader in the Kannada newspaper segment then.\n\nThe paper launched a Chennai edition, 12 April 2008. It launched a Kolhapur edition, February 2013.\n\nIntroduced in 2013 and awarded for the second time in 2016, \"The Times of India Film Awards\" or the \"TOIFA\" is an award for the work in Film Industry decided by a global public vote on the nomination categories.\n\n\"The Times of India\" is published by the media group Bennett, Coleman & Co.

The company, along with its other group of companies, known as The Times Group, also publishes \"Ahmedabad Mirror\"; \"Bangalore Mirror\"; \"Bangalore Times\", \"Delhi Times\"; \"The Economic Times\"; \"ET Panache\" (Mumbai, Delhi, Bengaluru on Monday to Friday, and as \"Times of India ET Panache\" in Pune and Chennai, every Saturday) \"Ei Samay\", (a Bengali daily); the \"Maharashtra Times\", (a Marathi-language daily broadsheet); \"Mumbai Mirror\"; the \"Navbharat Times\", (a Hindi-language daily broadsheet); and \"Pune Mirror\".\n\n\"The Times of India\" has its markets in major cities such as Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Allahabad, Aurangabad, Bangalore, Bhopal, Bhubaneswar, Calicut, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Guwahati, Hubli, Hyderabad, Indore, Jaipur, Kochi, Kolhapur, Kolkata, Lucknow, Madurai, Mangalore, Mysore, Nagpur, Nashik, Panaji, Patna, Puducherry, Pune, Raipur, Ranchi, Surat, Trichy, Trivandrum, Varanasi, Vijayawada and Visakhapatnam.\n\n\n\"The Times of India\" has been criticized for being the first to institutionalize the practice of paid news in India, where politicians, businessmen, corporations and celebrities can pay the newspaper and its journalists would carry the desired news for the payer. The newspaper offers prominence with which the paid news is placed and the page on which it is displayed based on the amount of the payment. According to this practice, a payment plan assures a news feature and ensures positive coverage to the payer. In 2005, \"The Times of India\" began the practice of \"private treaties\", also called as \"brand capital\", where new companies, individuals or movies seeking mass coverage and public relations, major brands and organizations were offered sustained positive coverage and plugs in its news columns in exchange for shares or other forms of financial obligations to Bennett, Coleman & Company, Ltd. (B.C.C.L.) – the owners of \"The Times of India\". The B.C.C.L., with its \"private treaties\" program, acquired stakes in 350 companies and generated 15% of its revenues by 2012, according to a critical article in \"The New Yorker\". The \"paid news\" and \"private treaties\" practice started by \"The Times of India\" has since been adopted by \"The Hindustan Times\" group, the \"India Today\" group, the \"Outlook\" group, and other major media groups in India including Indian television channels. This division of the company was later renamed Brand Capital and has contracts in place with many companies in diverse sectors.\n\nThe \"paid news\" and \"private treaties\" blur the lines between content and advertising, with the favorable coverage written by the staff reporters on the payroll of \"The Times of India\". The newspaper has defended its practice in 2012 by stating that it includes a note of disclosure to the reader – though in a small font – that its contents are \"advertorial, entertainment promotional feature\", that they are doing this to generate revenues just like \"all newspapers in the world do advertorials\" according to \"The Times of India\" owners. According to Maya Ranganathan, this overlap in the function of a journalist to also act as a marketing and advertisement revenue seeker for the newspaper raises conflict of interest questions, a problem that has morphed into ever-larger scale in India and recognized by India's SEBI authority in July 2009.\n\nUnder an ad sales initiative called Medianet, if a large company or Bollywood studio sponsored a news-worthy event, the event would be covered by the Times of India but the name of the company or studio that sponsored it will not be mentioned in the paper unless they paid the Times of India for advertising. In 2010, a report by a subcommittee of India's Press Council found that Medianet's paid news strategy had spread to a large number of newspapers and more than five hundred television channels.\n\nCritics state that the company's paid news and private treaties skew its coverage and shield its newspaper advertisers from scrutiny. The Hoot, a media criticism website, has pointed out that when an elevator in a 19-storey luxury apartment complex in Bangalore crashed killing two workers and injuring seven, all the English language and Kannada language newspapers with the exception of the Times of India called out the name of the construction company, Sobha Developers, which was a private-treaty partner. An article titled \"reaping gold through bt cotton,\" which first appeared in the Nagpur edition of the Times of India in 2008, reappeared unchanged in 2011, this time with a small print alert that the article was a \"marketing feature\". In both cases, the article was factually incorrect and made false claims about the success of Monsanto's genetically modified cotton. According to a critical article published in the Indian magazine \"The Caravan\", when the Honda Motors plant in Gurgaon experienced an eight-month-long conflict between management and non-unionized workers over wages and work conditions in 2005, the \"Times of India\" covered the concerns of Honda and the harm done to India's investment climate and largely ignored the issues raised by workers.\n\nVineet Jain, Managing Director of B.C.C.L., has insisted that a wall does exist between sales and the newsroom, and that the paper does not give favorable coverage to the company's business partners. \"Our editors don’t know who we have,\" Jain said, although he later acknowledged that all private-treaty clients are listed on the company's Web site. Ravindra Dhariwal, the former CEO of B.C.C.L. had defended private treaties in a 2010 interview with the magazine \"Outlook\" and claims that the partners in the private treaties sign contracts where they agree to clauses that they will not receive any favorable editorial coverage.\n\nThere have been claims that \"The Times of India\" would strike deals with advertisers only if they removed their advertisements from other competitor newspapers.\n\nThe Times of India is also embroiled in an active lawsuit against the Financial Times. In 1993, when the Financial Times was preparing to enter the Indian market, Samir Jain the Vice-Chairman of B.C.C.L. registered the term \"Financial Times\" as a trademark of his company and declared it his intellectual property in an attempt to stymie the Financial Times and prevent them from competing with the Economic Times which is owned by B.C.C.L.\n\nIn 1994, when the Hindustan Times was the top-selling paper in New Delhi, the Times of India slashed their prices by a third, to one and a half rupees after having built up their ads sales force in preparation for the price drop to make up for the lost circulation revenue. By 1998, the Hindustan Times had dropped to second place in Delhi. The Times of India took a similar strategy in Bangalore where they dropped the price to one rupee despite protests from Siddharth Varadarajan, one of the editors of the newspaper at the time, who called the strategy \"predatory pricing\".\n\nIn 2018, Vineet Jain, Managing Director of B.C.C.L., and Sanjeev Shah, executive president of B.C.C.L., were caught on camera as part of an undercover sting operation by Cobrapost agreeing to promote Hindutva content through the group's many media properties for a proposed spend of ₹500 crore, some of which the client said could only be paid with black money. B.C.C.L. has responded to the sting claiming that the video that was released by Cobrapost was incomplete and doctored and that Vineet Jain was engaged in a counter-sting of his own to expose the undercover reporter during the filming of the video.\n\nPublisher\n\n"}
{"id": "30680", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30680", "title": "The New York Times", "text": "The New York Times\n\nThe New York Times is an American newspaper based in New York City with worldwide influence and readership. Founded in 1851, the paper has won 127 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The \"Times\" is ranked 18th in the world by circulation and 3rd in the U.S. Nicknamed \"The Gray Lady,\" the \"Times\" has long been regarded within the industry as a national \"newspaper of record.\" The paper's motto, \"All the News That's Fit to Print\", appears in the upper left-hand corner of the front page.\n\nThe paper is owned by The New York Times Company, which is publicly traded and is controlled by the Sulzberger family through a dual-class share structure. It has been owned by the family since 1896; A.G. Sulzberger, the paper's publisher, and his father, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., the company's chairman, are the fourth and fifth generation of the family to head the paper.\n\nSince the mid-1970s, \"The New York Times\" has greatly expanded its layout and organization, adding special weekly sections on various topics supplementing the regular news, editorials, sports, and features. Since 2008, the \"Times\" has been organized into the following sections: News, Editorials/Opinions-Columns/Op-Ed, New York (metropolitan), Business, Sports of The Times, Arts, Science, Styles, Home, Travel, and other features.\n\nOn Sunday, the \"Times\" is supplemented by the \"Sunday Review\" (formerly the \"Week in Review\"), \"The New York Times Book Review\", \"The New York Times Magazine\" and \"\". The \"Times\" stayed with the broadsheet full-page set-up and an eight-column format for several years after most papers switched to six, and was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, especially on the front page.\n\n\"The New York Times\" was founded as the New-York Daily Times on September 18, 1851. Founded by journalist and politician Henry Jarvis Raymond and former banker George Jones, the \"Times\" was initially published by Raymond, Jones & Company. Early investors in the company included Edwin B. Morgan, Christopher Morgan, and Edward B. Wesley. Sold for a penny (equivalent to cents today), the inaugural edition attempted to address various speculations on its purpose and positions that preceded its release:\nIn 1852, the newspaper started a western division, \"The Times of California\", which arrived whenever a mail boat from New York docked in California. However, the effort failed once local California newspapers came into prominence.\n\nOn September 14, 1857, the newspaper officially shortened its name to The New-York Times. (The hyphen in the city name was dropped on December 1, 1896.) On April 21, 1861, \"The New York Times\" began publishing a Sunday edition to offer daily coverage of the Civil War. One of the earliest public controversies it was involved with was the Mortara Affair, the subject of twenty editorials in the \"Times\" alone.\n\nThe main office of \"The New York Times\" was attacked during the New York City Draft Riots. The riots, sparked by the beginning of drafting for the Union Army, began on July 13, 1863. On \"Newspaper Row\", across from City Hall, Henry Raymond stopped the rioters with Gatling guns, early machine guns, one of which he manned himself. The mob diverted, instead attacking the headquarters of abolitionist publisher Horace Greeley's \"New York Tribune\" until being forced to flee by the Brooklyn City Police, who had crossed the East River to help the Manhattan authorities.\n\nIn 1869, Henry Raymond died, and George Jones took over as publisher.\n\nThe newspaper's influence grew in 1870 and 1871, when it published a series of exposés on William Tweed, leader of the city's Democratic Party—popularly known as \"Tammany Hall\" (from its early-19th-century meeting headquarters)—that led to the end of the Tweed Ring's domination of New York's City Hall. Tweed had offered \"The New York Times\" five million dollars (equivalent to million dollars in ) to not publish the story.\n\nIn the 1880s, \"The New York Times\" gradually transitioned from supporting Republican Party candidates in its editorials to becoming more politically independent and analytical. In 1884, the paper supported Democrat Grover Cleveland (former mayor of Buffalo and governor of New York) in his first presidential campaign. While this move cost \"The New York Times\" a portion of its readership among its more progressive and Republican readers (revenue declined from $188,000 to $56,000 from 1883–1884), the paper eventually regained most of its lost ground within a few years.\n\nAfter George Jones died in 1891, Charles Ransom Miller and other \"New York Times\" editors raised $1million dollars (equivalent to $million in ) to buy the \"Times\", printing it under the New York Times Publishing Company. However, the newspaper found itself in a financial crisis by the Panic of 1893, and by 1896, the newspaper had a circulation of less than 9,000, and was losing $1,000 a day. That year, Adolph Ochs, the publisher of the \"Chattanooga Times\", gained a controlling interest in the company for $75,000.\n\nShortly after assuming control of the paper, Ochs coined the paper's slogan, \"All The News That's Fit To Print\". The slogan has appeared in the paper since September 1896, and has been printed in a box in the upper left hand corner of the front page since early 1897. The slogan was a jab at competing papers, such as Joseph Pulitzer's \"New York World\" and William Randolph Hearst's \"New York Journal\", which were known for a lurid, sensationalist and often inaccurate reporting of facts and opinions, described by the end of the century as \"yellow journalism\". Under Ochs' guidance, aided by Carr Van Anda, \"The New York Times\" achieved international scope, circulation, and reputation; Sunday circulation went from under 9,000 in 1896 to 780,000 in 1934. In 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, \"The New York Times\", along with \"The Times\", received the first on-the-spot wireless telegraph transmission from a naval battle: a report of the destruction of the Russian Navy's Baltic Fleet, at the Battle of Port Arthur, from the press-boat \"Haimun\". In 1910, the first air delivery of \"The New York Times\" to Philadelphia began. In 1919, \"The New York Times\" first trans-Atlantic delivery to London occurred by dirigible balloon. In 1920, during the 1920 Republican National Convention, a \"4 A.M. Airplane Edition\" was sent to Chicago by plane, so it could be in the hands of convention delegates by evening.\n\nOchs died in 1935, and was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. Under his leadership, and that of his son-in-law (and successor), Orvil Dryfoos, the paper extended its breadth and reach, beginning in the 1940s. The crossword began appearing regularly in 1942, and the fashion section first appeared in 1946. \"The New York Times\" began an international edition in 1946. (The international edition stopped publishing in 1967, when \"The New York Times\" joined the owners of the \"New York Herald Tribune\" and \"The Washington Post\" to publish the \"International Herald Tribune\" in Paris.)\n\nDryfoos died in 1963, and was succeeded as publisher by his brother-in-law, Arthur Ochs \"Punch\" Sulzberger, who led the \"Times\" until 1992, and continued the expansion of the paper.\n\nThe paper's involvement in a 1964 libel case helped bring one of the key United States Supreme Court decisions supporting freedom of the press, \"New York Times Co. v. Sullivan\". In it, the United States Supreme Court established the \"actual malice\" standard for press reports about public officials or public figures to be considered defamatory or libelous. The malice standard requires the plaintiff in a defamation or libel case prove the publisher of the statement knew the statement was false or acted in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. Because of the high burden of proof on the plaintiff, and difficulty in proving malicious intent, such cases by public figures rarely succeed.\n\nThe case foreshadowed another major libel case, \"Steven J. Hatfill v. The New York Times Company, and Nicholas Kristof\", resulting from the 2001 anthrax attacks (which included powder in an envelope opened by reporter Judith Miller inside the \"Times\" newsroom). Dr. Hatfill became a public figure as a result of insinuations that he was the \"likely culprit\" put forth in Kristof's columns, which referenced the Federal Bureau of Investigation investigation of the case. Dr. Hatfill sued him and the \"Times\" for defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. After years of proceedings, the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari in the case, leaving Dr. Hatfill's case dismissed since he had not proved malice on the part of the \"Times.\"\n\nThe \"Times\" was involved in a similar case in which it agreed to pay a settlement to Dr. Wen Ho Lee who was falsely accused of espionage.\n\nIn 1971, the \"Pentagon Papers\", a secret United States Department of Defense history of the United States' political and military involvement in the Vietnam War from 1945 to 1967, were given (\"leaked\") to Neil Sheehan of \"The New York Times\" by former State Department official Daniel Ellsberg, with his friend Anthony Russo assisting in copying them. \"The New York Times\" began publishing excerpts as a series of articles on June 13. Controversy and lawsuits followed. The papers revealed, among other things, that the government had deliberately expanded its role in the war by conducting air strikes over Laos, raids along the coast of North Vietnam, and offensive actions taken by U.S. Marines well before the public was told about the actions, all while President Lyndon B. Johnson had been promising not to expand the war. The document increased the credibility gap for the U.S. government, and hurt efforts by the Nixon administration to fight the ongoing war.\n\nWhen \"The New York Times\" began publishing its series, President Richard Nixon became incensed. His words to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger included \"People have gotta be put to the torch for this sort of thing\" and \"Let's get the son-of-a-bitch in jail.\" After failing to get \"The New York Times\" to stop publishing, Attorney General John Mitchell and President Nixon obtained a federal court injunction that \"The New York Times\" cease publication of excerpts. The newspaper appealed and the case began working through the court system. On June 18, 1971, \"The Washington Post\" began publishing its own series. Ben Bagdikian, a \"Post\" editor, had obtained portions of the papers from Ellsberg. That day the \"Post\" received a call from the Assistant Attorney General, William Rehnquist, asking them to stop publishing. When the \"Post\" refused, the U.S. Justice Department sought another injunction. The U.S. District court judge refused, and the government appealed. On June 26, 1971, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to take both cases, merging them into . On June 30, 1971, the Supreme Court held in a 6–3 decision that the injunctions were unconstitutional prior restraints and that the government had not met the burden of proof required. The justices wrote nine separate opinions, disagreeing on significant substantive issues. While it was generally seen as a victory for those who claim the First Amendment enshrines an absolute right to free speech, many felt it a lukewarm victory, offering little protection for future publishers when claims of national security were at stake.\n\nIn the 1970s, the paper introduced a number of new lifestyle sections including Weekend and Home, with the aim of attracting more advertisers and readers. Many criticized the move for betraying the paper's mission.\n\nOn September 7, 1976, the paper switched from an eight-column format to a six-column format. The overall page width stayed the same, with each column becoming wider. On September 14, 1987, the \"Times\" printed the heaviest ever newspaper, at over and 1,612 pages.\n\nIn 1992, \"Punch\" Sulzberger stepped down as publisher; his son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., succeeded him, first as publisher, and then as Chairman of the Board in 1997. The \"Times\" was one of the last newspapers to adopt color photography, with the first color photograph on the front page appearing on October 16, 1997.\n\n\"The New York Times\" was involved in a significant controversy regarding the allegations surrounding Iraq and weapons of mass destruction in September 2002. A front-page story was authored by Judith Miller which claimed that the Iraqi government was in the process of developing nuclear weapons was published (the source used was Ahmed Chalabi, hostile to the Iraqi government). \"The Times\" story was cited by officials such as Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Donald Rumsfeld as part of a campaign to commission the Iraq War. Miller and Sulzberger negotiated a private severance package in 2005.\n\n\"The New York Times\" switched to a digital production process sometime before 1980, but only began preserving the resulting digital text that year. In 1983, the \"Times\" sold the electronic rights to its articles to LexisNexis. As online distribution of news increased in the 1990s, the \"Times\" decided not renew the deal and in 1994 the newspaper regained electronic rights to its articles. On January 22, 1996, NYTimes.com began publishing.\n\nIn September 2008, \"The New York Times\" announced that it would be combining certain sections effective October 6, 2008, in editions printed in the New York metropolitan area. The changes folded the Metro Section into the main International / National news section and combined Sports and Business (except Saturday through Monday, while Sports continues to be printed as a standalone section). This change also included having the name of the Metro section called New York outside of the Tri-State Area. The presses used by \"The New York Times\" can allow four sections to be printed simultaneously; as the paper includes more than four sections on all days with the exception of Saturday, the sections were required to be printed separately in an early press run and collated together. The changes allowed \"The New York Times\" to print in four sections Monday through Wednesday, in addition to Saturday. \"The New York Times\" announcement stated that the number of news pages and employee positions would remain unchanged, with the paper realizing cost savings by cutting overtime expenses.\n\nIn 2009, the newspaper began production of local inserts in regions outside of the New York area. Beginning October 16, 2009, a two-page \"Bay Area\" insert was added to copies of the Northern California edition on Fridays and Sundays. The newspaper commenced production of a similar Friday and Sunday insert to the Chicago edition on November 20, 2009. The inserts consist of local news, policy, sports, and culture pieces, usually supported by local advertisements.\n\nFollowing industry trends, its weekday circulation had fallen in 2009 to fewer than one million.\n\nIn August 2007, the paper reduced the physical size of its print edition, cutting the page width from to a . This followed similar moves by a roster of other newspapers in the previous ten years, including \"USA Today\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"The Washington Post\". The move resulted in a 5% reduction in news space, but (in an era of dwindling circulation and significant advertising revenue losses) also saved about $12million a year.\n\nBecause of its declining sales largely attributed to the rise of news sources online, used especially be younger readers, and the decline of advertising revenue, the newspaper has been going through a downsizing for several years, offering buyouts to workers and cutting expenses, in common with a general trend among print news media.\n\nIn December 2012, the \"Times\" published \"Snow Fall\", a six-part article about the 2012 Tunnel Creek avalanche which integrated videos, photos, and interactive graphics and was hailed as a watershed moment for online journalism.\n\nIn 2016, reporters for the newspaper were reportedly the target of cyber security breaches. The Federal Bureau of Investigation was reportedly investigating the attacks. The cyber security breaches have been described as possibly being related to cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee.\n\nIn October 2018, the \"Times\" published a 14,218-word investigation into Donald Trump's \"self-made\" fortune and alleged tax fraud, an 18-month project based on examination of 100,000 pages of documents. The extensive article ran as an eight-page feature in the print edition and also was adapted into a shortened 2,500 word listicle featuring its key takeaways. After the midweek front-page story, the \"Times\" also republished the piece as a 12-page \"special report\" section in the Sunday paper. During the lengthy investigation, Showtime cameras followed the \"Times\" three investigative reporters for a half-hour documentary called \"The Family Business: Trump and Taxes\", which aired the following Sunday. The report won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting.\n\nIn May 2019, \"The New York Times\" announced that it would present a television news program based on news from its individual reporters stationed around the world and that it would premiere on FX and Hulu.\n\nThe newspaper's first building was located at 113 Nassau Street in New York City. In 1854, it moved to 138 Nassau Street, and in 1858 to 41 Park Row, making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use.\n\nThe newspaper moved its headquarters to the Times Tower, located at 1475 Broadway in 1904, in an area then called Longacre Square, that was later renamed Times Square the newspaper's honor. The top of the building now known as One Times Square is the site of the New Year's Eve tradition of lowering a lighted ball, which was begun by the paper. The building is also known for its electronic news ticker popularly known as \"The Zipper\" where headlines crawl around the outside of the building. It is still in use, but has been operated by Dow Jones & Company since 1995. After nine years in its Times Square tower, the newspaper had an annex built at 229 West 43rd Street. After several expansions, the 43rd Street building became the newspaper's main headquarters in 1960 and the Times Tower on Broadway was sold the following year. It served as the newspaper's main printing plant until 1997, when the newspaper opened a state-of-the-art printing plant in the College Point section of the borough of Queens.\n\nA decade later, \"The New York Times\" moved its newsroom and businesses headquarters from West 43rd Street to a new tower at 620 Eighth Avenue between West 40th and 41st Streets, in Manhattan directly across Eighth Avenue from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. The new headquarters for the newspaper, known officially as The New York Times Building but unofficially called the new \"Times Tower\" by many New Yorkers, is a skyscraper designed by Renzo Piano.\n\nIn August 2019, in an internal NYT email, obtained by Slate magazine, reported that evidence of bedbug activity was found on all floors of the newsroom.\n\nDiscriminatory practices used by the paper long restricted women in appointments to editorial positions. The newspaper's first general female reporter was Jane Grant, who described her experience afterwards: \"In the beginning I was charged not to reveal the fact that a female had been hired\". Other reporters nicknamed her Fluff and she was subjected to considerable hazing. Because of her gender, any promotion was out of the question, according to the then-managing editor. She remained on the staff for fifteen years, interrupted by World War I.\n\nIn 1935, Anne McCormick wrote to Arthur Hays Sulzberger: \"I hope you won't expect me to revert to 'woman's-point-of-view' stuff.\" Later, she interviewed major political leaders and appears to have had easier access than those of her colleagues. Even witnesses of her actions were unable to explain how she gained the interviews she did. Clifton Daniel said, \"[After World War II,] I'm sure Adenauer called her up and invited her to lunch. She never had to grovel for an appointment.\" Covering world leaders' speeches after World War II at the National Press Club was limited to men by a Club rule. When women were eventually allowed to hear the speeches directly, they were still not allowed to ask the speakers questions, although men were allowed and did ask, even though some of the women had won Pulitzer Prizes for prior work. \"Times\" reporter Maggie Hunter refused to return to the Club after covering one speech on assignment. Nan Robertson's article on the Union Stock Yards, Chicago, was read aloud as anonymous by a professor, who then said: \"'It will come as a surprise to you, perhaps, that the reporter is a \"girl,\" he began... [G]asps; amazement in the ranks. 'She had used all her senses, not just her eyes, to convey the smell and feel of the stockyards. She chose a difficult subject, an offensive subject. Her imagery was strong enough to revolt you.'\" \"The New York Times\" hired Kathleen McLaughlin after ten years at the \"Chicago Tribune\", where \"[s]he did a series on maids, going out herself to apply for housekeeping jobs.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" has had one slogan. Since 1896, the newspaper's slogan has been \"All the News That's Fit to Print.\" In 1896, Adolph Ochs held a competition to attempt to find a replacement slogan, offering a $100 prize for the best one. Entries included \"News, Not Nausea\"; \"In One Word: Adequate\"; \"News Without Noise\"; \"Out Heralds \"The Herald\", Informs \"The World\", and Extinguishes \"The Sun\"\"; \"The Public Press is a Public Trust\"; and the winner of the competition, \"All the world's news, but not a school for scandal.\" On May 10, 1960, Wright Patman asked the FTC to investigate whether \"The New York Times's\" slogan was misleading or false advertising. Within 10 days, the FTC responded that it was not.\n\nAgain in 1996, a competition was held to find a new slogan, this time for NYTimes.com. Over 8,000 entries were submitted. Again however, \"All the News That's Fit to Print,\" was found to be the best.\n\nIn addition to its New York City headquarters, the paper has newsrooms in London and Hong Kong. Its Paris newsroom, which had been the headquarters of the paper's international edition, was closed in 2016, although the city remains home to a news bureau and an advertising office. The paper also has an editing and wire service center in Gainesville, Florida.\n\n, the newspaper had six news bureaus in the New York region, 14 elsewhere in the United States, and 24 in other countries.\n\nIn 2009, Russ Stanton, editor of the \"Los Angeles Times\", a competitor, stated that the newsroom of \"The New York Times\" was twice the size of the \"Los Angeles Times\", which had a newsroom of 600 at the time.\n\nTo facilitate their reporting and to hasten an otherwise lengthy process of reviewing many documents during preparation for publication, their interactive news team has adapted optical character recognition technology into a proprietary tool known as \"Document Helper\". It enables the team to accelerate the processing of documents that need to be reviewed. During March 2019, they documented that this tool enabled them to process 900 documents in less than ten minutes in preparation for reporters to review the contents.\n\nIn 1896, Adolph Ochs bought \"The New York Times\", a money-losing newspaper, and formed the New York Times Company. The Ochs-Sulzberger family, one of the United States' newspaper dynasties, has owned \"The New York Times\" ever since. The publisher went public on January 14, 1969, trading at $42 a share on the American Stock Exchange. After this, the family continued to exert control through its ownership of the vast majority of Class B voting shares. Class A shareholders are permitted restrictive voting rights, while Class B shareholders are allowed open voting rights.\n\nThe Ochs-Sulzberger family trust controls roughly 88 percent of the company's class B shares. Any alteration to the dual-class structure must be ratified by six of eight directors who sit on the board of the Ochs-Sulzberger family trust. The Trust board members are Daniel H. Cohen, James M. Cohen, Lynn G. Dolnick, Susan W. Dryfoos, Michael Golden, Eric M. A. Lax, Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr., and Cathy J. Sulzberger.\n\nTurner Catledge, the top editor at \"The New York Times\" from 1952 to 1968, wanted to hide the ownership influence. Arthur Sulzberger routinely wrote memos to his editor, each containing suggestions, instructions, complaints, and orders. When Catledge would receive these memos, he would erase the publisher's identity before passing them to his subordinates. Catledge thought that if he removed the publisher's name from the memos, it would protect reporters from feeling pressured by the owner.\n\nThe position of public editor was established in 2003 to \"investigate matters of journalistic integrity\"; each public editor was to serve a two-year term. The post \"was established to receive reader complaints and question \"Times\" journalists on how they make decisions.\" The impetus for the creation of the public editor position was the Jayson Blair affair. Public editors were: Daniel Okrent (2003–2005), Byron Calame (2005–2007), Clark Hoyt (2007–2010) (served an extra year), Arthur S. Brisbane (2010–2012), Margaret Sullivan (2012–2016) (served a four-year term), and Elizabeth Spayd (2016–2017). In 2017, the \"Times\" eliminated the position of public editor.\n\nUnlike most US daily newspapers, the \"Times\" relies on its own in-house stylebook rather than The Associated Press Stylebook. When referring to people, \"The New York Times\" generally uses honorifics rather than unadorned last names (except in the sports pages, pop culture coverage, Book Review and Magazine).\n\n\"The New York Times\" printed a display advertisement on its first page on January 6, 2009, breaking tradition at the paper. The advertisement, for CBS, was in color and ran the entire width of the page. The newspaper promised it would place first-page advertisements on only the lower half of the page.\n\nIn August 2014, the \"Times\" decided to use the word \"torture\" to describe incidents in which interrogators \"inflicted pain on a prisoner in an effort to get information.\" This was a shift from the paper's previous practice of describe such practices as \"harsh\" or \"brutal\" interrogations.\n\nThe paper maintains a strict profanity policy. A 2007 review of a concert by punk band Fucked Up, for example, completely avoided mention of the group's name. However, the \"Times\" has on occasion published unfiltered video content that includes profanity and slurs where it has determined that such video has news value. During the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign, the \"Times\" did print the words \"fuck\" and \"pussy,\" among others, when reporting on the vulgar statements made by Donald Trump in a 2005 recording. Then-\"Times\" politics editor Carolyn Ryan said: \"It's a rare thing for us to use this language in our stories, even in quotes, and we discussed it at length.\" Ryan said the paper ultimately deciding to publish it because of its news value and because \"[t]o leave it out or simply describe it seemed awkward and less than forthright to us, especially given that we would be running a video that showed our readers exactly what was said.\"\n\nIn the absence of a major headline, the day's most important story generally appears in the top-right column, on the main page. The typefaces used for the headlines are custom variations of Cheltenham. The running text is set at 8.7 point Imperial.\n\nThe newspaper is organized in three sections, including the magazine.\n\nSome sections, such as Metro, are only found in the editions of the paper distributed in the New York–New Jersey–Connecticut Tri-state area and not in the national or Washington, D.C. editions. Aside from a weekly roundup of reprints of editorial cartoons from other newspapers, \"The New York Times\" does not have its own staff editorial cartoonist, nor does it feature a comics page or Sunday comics section.\n\nFrom 1851 to 2017, \"The New York Times\" published around 60,000 print issues containing about 3.5million pages and 15million articles.\n\nLike most other American newspapers, \"The New York Times\" has experienced a decline in circulation. Its printed weekday circulation dropped by percent to 540,000 copies from 2005 to 2017.\n\n\"The New York Times International Edition\" is a print version of the paper tailored for readers outside the United States. Formerly a joint venture with \"The Washington Post\" named \"The International Herald Tribune\", \"The New York Times\" took full ownership of the paper in 2002 and has gradually integrated it more closely into its domestic operations.\n\n\"The New York Times\" began publishing daily on the World Wide Web on January 22, 1996, \"offering readers around the world immediate access to most of the daily newspaper's contents.\" The website had 555million pageviews in March 2005. The domain \"nytimes.com\" attracted at least 146million visitors annually by 2008 according to a Compete.com study. In March 2009, \"The New York Times\" website ranked 59th by number of unique visitors, with over 20million unique visitors, making it the most visited newspaper site with more than twice the number of unique visitors as the next most popular site. , nytimes.com produced 22 of the 50 most popular newspaper blogs. In 2017 \"The New York Times\" was among the ten most cited sources in the English Wikipedia. NYTimes.com was ranked 105 in the world, and 29 in the U.S. by Alexa on September 24, 2019.\n\nIn September 2005, the paper decided to begin subscription-based service for daily columns in a program known as \"TimesSelect\", which encompassed many previously free columns. Until being discontinued two years later, \"TimesSelect\" cost $7.95 per month or $49.95 per year, though it was free for print copy subscribers and university students and faculty. To avoid this charge, bloggers often reposted TimesSelect material, and at least one site once compiled links of reprinted material. On September 17, 2007, \"The New York Times\" announced that it would stop charging for access to parts of its Web site, effective at midnight the following day, reflecting a growing view in the industry that subscription fees cannot outweigh the potential ad revenue from increased traffic on a free site. In addition to opening almost the entire site to all readers, \"The New York Times\" news archives from 1987 to the present are available at no charge, as well as those from 1851 to 1922, which are in the public domain. Access to the \"Premium Crosswords\" section continues to require either home delivery or a subscription for $6.95 per month or $39.95 per year. \"Times\" columnists including Nicholas Kristof and Thomas Friedman had criticized \"TimesSelect\", with Friedman going so far as to say \"I hate it. It pains me enormously because it's cut me off from a lot, a lot of people, especially because I have a lot of people reading me overseas, like in India ... I feel totally cut off from my audience.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" was made available on the iPhone and iPod Touch in 2008, and on the iPad mobile devices in 2010. It was also the first newspaper to offer a video game as part of its editorial content, \"Food Import Folly\" by Persuasive Games. In 2010, \"The New York Times\" editors collaborated with students and faculty from New York University's Studio 20 Journalism Masters program to launch and produce \"The Local East Village\", a hyperlocal blog designed to offer news \"by, for and about the residents of the East Village\". That same year, reCAPTCHA helped to digitize old editions of \"The New York Times\".\n\nIn 2012, \"The New York Times\" introduced a Chinese-language news site, cn.nytimes.com, with content created by staff based in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, though the server was placed outside of China to avoid censorship issues. In March 2013, \"The New York Times\" and National Film Board of Canada announced a partnership titled \"A Short History of the Highrise\", which will create four short documentaries for the Internet about life in high rise buildings as part of the NFB's \"Highrise\" project, utilizing images from the newspaper's photo archives for the first three films, and user-submitted images for the final film. The third project in the series, \"A Short History of the Highrise\", won a Peabody Award in 2013.\n\nFalling print advertising revenue and projections of continued decline resulted in a \"metered paywall\" being instituted in 2011, regarded as modestly successful after garnering several hundred thousand subscriptions and about $100million in revenue . As announced in March 2011, the paywall would charge frequent readers for access to its online content. Readers would be able to access up to 20 articles each month without charge. (Although beginning in April 2012, the number of free-access articles was halved to just ten articles per month.) Any reader who wanted to access more would have to pay for a digital subscription. This plan would allow free access for occasional readers, but produce revenue from \"heavy\" readers. Digital subscriptions rates for four weeks range from $15 to $35 depending on the package selected, with periodic new subscriber promotions offering four-week all-digital access for as low as 99¢. Subscribers to the paper's print edition get full access without any additional fee. Some content, such as the front page and section fronts remained free, as well as the Top News page on mobile apps. In January 2013, \"The New York Times\" Public Editor Margaret M. Sullivan announced that for the first time in many decades, the paper generated more revenue through subscriptions than through advertising. In December 2017, the number of free articles per month was reduced from ten to five, as the first change to the metered paywall since 2012. An executive of \"The New York Times Company\" stated that the decision was motivated by \"an all-time high\" in the demand for journalism.\n\nThe newspaper's website was hacked on August 29, 2013, by the Syrian Electronic Army, a hacking group that supports the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The SEA managed to penetrate the paper's domain name registrar, Melbourne IT, and alter DNS records for \"The New York Times\", putting some of its websites out of service for hours.\n\nThe food section is supplemented on the web by properties for home cooks and for out-of-home dining. \"The New York Times\" Cooking (cooking.nytimes.com; also available via iOS app) provides access to more than 17,000 recipes on file , and availability of saving recipes from other sites around the web. The newspaper's restaurant search (nytimes.com/reviews/dining) allows online readers to search NYC area restaurants by cuisine, neighborhood, price, and reviewer rating. \"The New York Times\" has also published several cookbooks, including \"The Essential New York Times Cookbook: Classic Recipes for a New Century\", published in late 2010.\n\n, \"The New York Times\" has a total of 3.5million paid subscriptions in both print and digital versions, and more than 130million monthly readers, more than double its audience two years previously.\n\nIn February 2018, The New York Times Company reported increased revenue from the digital-only subscriptions, adding 157,000 new subscribers to a total of 2.6million digital-only subscribers. Digital advertising also saw growth during this period. At the same time, advertising for the print version of the journal fell.\n\nThe \"Times Reader\" is a digital version of \"The New York Times\". It was created via a collaboration between the newspaper and Microsoft. \"Times Reader\" takes the principles of print journalism and applies them to the technique of online reporting. \"Times Reader\" uses a series of technologies developed by Microsoft and their Windows Presentation Foundation team. It was announced in Seattle in April 2006, by Arthur Ochs Sulzberger Jr., Bill Gates, and Tom Bodkin. In 2009, the \"Times Reader\" 2.0 was rewritten in Adobe AIR. In December 2013, the newspaper announced that the Times Reader app would be discontinued on January 6, 2014, urging readers of the app to instead begin using the subscription-only \"Today's Paper\" app.\n\nIn 2008, \"The New York Times\" created an app for the iPhone and iPod Touch which allowed users to download articles to their mobile device enabling them to read the paper even when they were unable to receive a signal. In April 2010, \"The New York Times\" announced it would begin publishing daily content through an iPad app. , \"The New York Times\" iPad app is ad-supported and available for free without a paid subscription, but translated into a subscription-based model in 2011.\n\nIn 2010, the newspaper also launched an app for Android smartphones, followed later by an app for Windows Phones.\n\n\"The New York Times\" began producing podcasts in 2006. Among the early podcasts were \"Inside The Times\" and \"Inside The New York Times Book Review\". Several of the \"Times\" podcasts were cancelled in 2012. The \"Times\" returned to launching new podcasts in 2016, including \"Modern Love\" with WBUR. On January 30, 2017, \"The New York Times\" launched a news podcast, \"The Daily\". In October 2018, NYT debuted \"The Argument\" with opinion columnists Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt. It is a weekly discussion about a single issue explained from the left, center, and right of the political spectrum.\n\nBetween February 2016 and September 2019, \"The New York Times\" launched a standalone Spanish language edition, \"The New York Times en Español\". The Spanish language version featured increased coverage of news and events in Latin America and Spain. The expansion into Spanish language news content allowed the newspaper to expand its audience into the Spanish speaking world and increase its revenue. The Spanish language version was seen as a way to compete with the established El País newspaper of Spain, which bills itself the \"global newspaper in Spanish\". It Spanish version has a team of journalists in Mexico City as well as correspondents in Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Miami, and Madrid, Spain. It was discontinued in September 2019, citing lack of financial success as the reason.\n\nIn June 2012, \"The New York Times\" launched its first official foreign-language variant, cn.nytimes.com, in Chinese, viewable in both traditional and simplified Chinese characters. The project was led by Craig S. Smith on the business side and Philip P. Pan on the editorial side.\n\nThe site's initial success was interrupted in October that year following the publication of an investigative article by David Barboza about the finances of Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao's family. In retaliation for the article, the Chinese government blocked access to both nytimes.com and cn.nytimes.com inside the People's Republic of China (PRC).\n\nDespite Chinese government interference, however, the Chinese-language operations have continued to develop, adding a second site, cn.nytstyle.com, iOS and Android apps and newsletters, all of which are accessible inside the PRC. The China operations also produce three print publications in Chinese. Traffic to cn.nytimes.com, meanwhile, has risen due to the widespread use of VPN technology in the PRC and to a growing Chinese audience outside mainland China. \"The New York Times\" articles are also available to users in China via the use of mirror websites, apps, domestic newspapers, and social media. The Chinese platforms now represent one of \"The New York Times\" top five digital markets globally. The editor-in-chief of the Chinese platforms is Ching-Ching Ni.\n\nThe TimesMachine is a web-based archive of scanned issues of \"The New York Times\" from 1851 through 2002.\n\nUnlike \"The New York Times\" online archive, the TimesMachine presents scanned images of the actual newspaper. All non-advertising content can be displayed on a per-story basis in a separate PDF display page and saved for future reference. The archive is available to \"The New York Times\" subscribers, home delivery and/or digital.\n\nBecause of holidays, no editions were printed on November 23, 1851; January 2, 1852; July 4, 1852; January 2, 1853; and January 1, 1854.\n\nBecause of strikes, the regular edition of \"The New York Times\" was not printed during the following periods:\n\n\"The New York Times\" editorial page is often regarded as liberal. In mid-2004, the newspaper's then public editor (ombudsman), Daniel Okrent, wrote that \"the Op-Ed page editors do an evenhanded job of representing a range of views in the essays from outsiders they publish – but you need an awfully heavy counterweight to balance a page that also bears the work of seven opinionated columnists, only two of whom could be classified as conservative (and, even then, of the conservative subspecies that supports legalization of gay unions and, in the case of William Safire, opposes some central provisions of the Patriot Act).\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" has not endorsed a Republican Party member for president since Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956; since 1960, it has endorsed the Democratic Party nominee in every presidential election (see New York Times presidential endorsements). However, \"The New York Times\" did endorse incumbent moderate Republican mayors of New York City Rudy Giuliani in 1997, and Michael Bloomberg in 2005 and 2009. The \"Times\" also endorsed Republican New York state governor George Pataki for re-election in 2002.\n\n\"The New York Times\" was criticized for the work of reporter Walter Duranty, who served as its Moscow bureau chief from 1922 through 1936. Duranty wrote a series of stories in 1931 on the Soviet Union and won a Pulitzer Prize for his work at that time; however, he has been criticized for his denial of widespread famine, most particularly the Ukrainian famine in the 1930s. In 2003, after the Pulitzer Board began a renewed inquiry, the \"Times\" hired Mark von Hagen, professor of Russian history at Columbia University, to review Duranty's work. Von Hagen found Duranty's reports to be unbalanced and uncritical, and that they far too often gave voice to Stalinist propaganda. In comments to the press he stated, \"For the sake of The New York Times' honor, they should take the prize away.\"\n\nOn November 14, 2001, in \"The New York Times\" 150th anniversary issue, in an article entitled \"Turning Away From the Holocaust,\" former executive editor Max Frankel wrote:\n\nAccording to Frankel, harsh judges of \"The New York Times\" \"have blamed 'self-hating Jews' and 'anti-Zionists' among the paper's owners and staff.\" Frankel responded to this criticism by describing the fragile sensibilities of the Jewish owners of \"The New York Times\":\n\nAt \"The Times\", the reluctance to highlight the systematic slaughter of Jews was also undoubtedly influenced by the views of the publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger. He believed strongly and publicly that Judaism was a religion, not a race or nationality – that Jews should be separate only in the way they worshiped. He thought they needed no state or political and social institutions of their own. He went to great lengths to avoid having \"The Times\" branded a \"Jewish newspaper.\" He resented other publications for emphasizing the Jewishness of people in the news. \n\nIn the same article, Frankel quotes Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, who concluded that the newspaper had downplayed Nazi Germany's targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book \"Buried by the Times\" documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth in part to the complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.\n\nJerold Auerbach, a Guggenheim Fellow and Fulbright Lecturer, wrote in \"Print to Fit, The New York Times, Zionism and Israel, 1896-2016\" that it was of utmost importance to Adolph Ochs, the first Jewish owner of the paper, that in spite of the persecution of Jews in Germany, \"The Times\", through its reporting, should never be classified as a \"Jewish newspaper\".\n\nAfter Ochs' death in 1935, his son-in-law Arthur Hays Sulzberger became the publisher of \"The New York Times\" and maintained the understanding that no reporting should reflect on \"The Times\" as a Jewish newspaper. Sulzburger shared Ochs' concerns about the way Jews were perceived in American society. His apprehensions about judgement were manifested positively by his strong fidelity to the United States. At the same time, within the pages of \"The New York Times,\" Sulzburger refused to bring attention to Jews, including the refusal to identify Jews as major victims of the Nazi genocide. To be sure, many reports of Nazi-authored slaughter identified Jewish victims as \"persons.\" \"The Times\" even opposed the rescue of Jewish refugees and backed American constraint.\n\nDuring the war, \"The New York Times\" journalist William L. Laurence was \"on the payroll of the War Department\".\n\nThe \"Times\" supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq. On May 26, 2004, more than a year after the war started, the newspaper asserted that some of its articles had not been as rigorous as they should have been, and were insufficiently qualified, frequently overly dependent upon information from Iraqi exiles desiring regime change. Reporter Judith Miller retired after criticisms that her reporting of the lead-up to the Iraq War was factually inaccurate and overly favorable to the George W. Bush administration's position, for which \"The New York Times\" later apologized. One of Miller's prime sources was Ahmed Chalabi, an Iraqi expatriate who returned to Iraq after the U.S. invasion and held a number of governmental positions culminating in acting oil minister and deputy prime minister from May 2005 until May 2006.\n\nIn May 2003, \"The New York Times\" reporter Jayson Blair was forced to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories. Some critics contended that African-American Blair's race was a major factor in his hiring and in \"The New York Times\" initial reluctance to fire him.\n\nThe newspaper was criticized for largely reporting the prosecutors' version of events in the 2006 Duke lacrosse case. Suzanne Smalley of \"Newsweek\" criticized the newspaper for its \"credulous\" coverage of the charges of rape against Duke University lacrosse players. Stuart Taylor Jr. and KC Johnson, in their book \"Until Proven Innocent: Political Correctness and the Shameful Injustices of the Duke Lacrosse Rape Case\", write: \"at the head of the guilt-presuming pack, \"The New York Times\" vied in a race to the journalistic bottom with trash-TV talk shows.\"\n\nA 2003 study in \"The Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics\" concluded that \"The New York Times\" reporting was more favorable to Israelis than to Palestinians. A 2002 study published in the journal \"Journalism\" examined Middle East coverage of the Second Intifada over a one-month period in the \"Times\", \"Washington Post\" and \"Chicago Tribune\". The study authors said that the \"Times\" was \"the most slanted in a pro-Israeli direction\" with a bias \"reflected ... in its use of headlines, photographs, graphics, sourcing practices and lead paragraphs.\"\n\nFor its coverage of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As'ad AbuKhalil) have insisted that it is pro-Israel. \"The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy\", by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that \"The New York Times\" sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized \"The New York Times\" for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected a proposal to write an article for the paper on grounds of lack of objectivity. A piece in which Thomas Friedman commented that praise awarded to Netanyahu during a speech at congress was \"paid for by the Israel lobby\" elicited an apology and clarification from its writer.\n\n\"The New York Times\" public editor Clark Hoyt concluded in his January 10, 2009, column, \"Though the most vociferous supporters of Israel and the Palestinians do not agree, I think \"The New York Times\", largely barred from the battlefield and reporting amid the chaos of war, has tried its best to do a fair, balanced and complete job— and has largely succeeded.\"\n\nIn February 2009, a \"Village Voice\" music blogger accused the newspaper of using \"chintzy, \"ad-hominem\" allegations\" in an article on British Tamil music artist M.I.A. concerning her activism against the Sinhala-Tamil conflict in Sri Lanka. M.I.A. criticized the paper in January 2010 after a travel piece rated post-conflict Sri Lanka the \"#1 place to go in 2010\". In June 2010, \"The New York Times Magazine\" published a correction on its cover article of M.I.A., acknowledging that the interview conducted by current \"W\" editor and then-\"Times Magazine\" contributor Lynn Hirschberg contained a recontextualization of two quotes. In response to the piece, M.I.A. broadcast Hirschberg's phone number and secret audio recordings from the interview via her Twitter and website.\n\n\"The New York Times\" was criticized for the 13-month delay of the December 2005 story revealing the U.S. National Security Agency warrantless surveillance program. Ex-NSA officials blew the whistle on the program to journalists James Risen and Eric Lichtblau, who presented an investigative article to the newspaper in November 2004, weeks before America's presidential election. Contact with former agency officials began the previous summer.\n\nFormer \"The New York Times\" executive editor Bill Keller decided not to report the piece after being pressured by the Bush administration and being advised not to do so by \"The New York Times\" Washington bureau chief Philip Taubman. Keller explained the silence's rationale in an interview with the newspaper in 2013, stating \"Three years after 9/11, we, as a country, were still under the influence of that trauma, and we, as a newspaper, were not immune\".\n\nIn 2014, \"PBS Frontline\" interviewed Risen and Lichtblau, who said that the newspaper's plan was to not publish the story at all. \"The editors were furious at me\", Risen said to the program. \"They thought I was being insubordinate.\" Risen wrote a book about the mass surveillance revelations after \"The New York Times\" declined the piece's publication, and only released it after Risen told them that he would publish the book. Another reporter told NPR that the newspaper \"avoided disaster\" by ultimately publishing the story.\n\nOn June 16, 2015, \"The New York Times\" published an article reporting the deaths of six Irish students staying in Berkeley, California when the balcony they were standing on collapsed, the paper's story insinuating that they were to blame for the collapse. The paper stated that the behavior of Irish students coming to the U.S. on J1 visas was an \"embarrassment to Ireland\". The Irish Taoiseach and former President of Ireland criticized the newspaper for \"being insensitive and inaccurate\" in its handling of the story.\n\nIn May 2015, a \"The New York Times\" exposé by Sarah Maslin Nir on the working conditions of manicurists in New York City and elsewhere and the health hazards to which they are exposed attracted wide attention, resulting in emergency workplace enforcement actions by New York governor Andrew M. Cuomo. In July 2015, the story's claims of widespread illegally low wages were challenged by former \"The New York Times\" reporter Richard Bernstein, in the \"New York Review of Books\". Bernstein, whose wife owns two nail salons, asserted that such illegally low wages were inconsistent with his personal experience, and were not evidenced by ads in the Chinese-language papers cited by the story. \"The New York Times\" editorial staff subsequently answered Bernstein's criticisms with examples of several published ads and stating that his response was industry advocacy. The independent \"NYT\" Public Editor also reported that she had previously corresponded with Bernstein and looked into his complaints, and expressed her belief that the story's reporting was sound.\n\nIn September and October 2015, nail salon owners and workers protested at \"The New York Times\" offices several times, in response to the story and the ensuing New York State crackdown. In October 2015, \"Reason\" magazine published a three-part re-reporting of the story by Jim Epstein, charging that the series was filled with misquotes and factual errors respecting both its claims of illegally low wages and health hazards. Epstein additionally argued that \"The New York Times\" had mistranslated the ads cited in its answer to Bernstein, and that those ads actually validated Bernstein's argument. In November 2015, \"The New York Times\" public editor concluded that the exposé's \"findings, and the language used to express them, should have been dialed back — in some instances substantially\" and recommended that \"The Times write further follow-up stories, including some that re-examine its original findings and that take on the criticism from salon owners and others — not defensively but with an open mind.\"\n\nA 2015 study found that \"The New York Times\" fed into an overarching tendency towards national bias. During the Iranian nuclear crisis the newspaper minimized the \"negative processes\" of the United States while overemphasizing similar processes of Iran. This tendency was shared by other papers such as \"The Guardian\", \"Tehran Times\", and the Fars News Agency, while Xinhua News Agency was found to be more neutral while at the same time mimicking the foreign policy of the People's Republic of China.\n\nIn April 2016, two black female employees in their sixties filed a federal class action lawsuit against The New York Times Company CEO Mark Thompson and chief revenue officer Meredith Levien, claiming age, gender, and racial discrimination. The plaintiffs claimed that the \"Times\" advertising department favored younger white employees over older black employees in making firing and promotion decisions. The \"Times\" said that the suit was \"entirely without merit\" and was \"a series of recycled, scurrilous and unjustified attacks.\" The plaintiffs' gender discrimination claims were subsequently dismissed by the court, and the court also later denied class certification as to the age and racial discrimination claims.\n\n\"The New York Times\" public editor (ombudsman) Elizabeth Spayd wrote in 2016 that \"Conservatives and even many moderates, see in The Times a blue-state worldview\" and accuse it of harboring a liberal bias. Spayd did not analyze the substance of the claim, but did opine that the \"Times\" is \"part of a fracturing media environment that reflects a fractured country. That in turn leads liberals and conservatives toward separate news sources.\" \"Times\" executive editor Dean Baquet stated that he does not believe coverage has a liberal bias, but that: \"We have to be really careful that people feel like they can see themselves in \"The New York Times\". I want us to be perceived as fair and honest to the world, not just a segment of it. It's a really difficult goal. Do we pull it off all the time? No.\"\n\n\"Times\" public editor Arthur Brisbane wrote in 2012: \"When The Times covers a national presidential campaign, I have found that the lead editors and reporters are disciplined about enforcing fairness and balance, and usually succeed in doing so. Across the paper's many departments, though, so many share a kind of political and cultural progressivism — for lack of a better term — that this worldview virtually bleeds through the fabric of The Times.\"\n\nIn mid-2004, the newspaper's then-public editor Daniel Okrent, wrote an opinion piece in which he said that \"The New York Times\" did have a liberal bias in news coverage of certain social issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. He stated that this bias reflected the paper's cosmopolitanism, which arose naturally from its roots as a hometown paper of New York City. He wrote, \"if you're examining the paper's coverage of these subjects from a perspective that is neither urban nor Northeastern nor culturally seen-it-all; if you are among the groups The Times treats as strange objects to be examined on a laboratory slide (devout Catholics, gun owners, Orthodox Jews, Texans); if your value system wouldn't wear well on a composite New York Times journalist, then a walk through this paper can make you feel you're traveling in a strange and forbidding world.\" Okrent wrote that the \"Time\"s Arts & Leisure; the Sunday \"Times Magazine\", and Culture coverage trend to the left.\n\nDonald Trump has frequently criticized \"The New York Times\" on his Twitter account before and during his presidency; since November 2015, Trump has referred to the \"Times\" as \"the failing New York Times\" in a series of tweets. Despite Trump's criticism, \"The New York Times\" editor Mark Thompson noted that the paper had enjoyed soaring digital readership, with the fourth quarter of 2016 seeing the highest number of new digital subscribers to the newspaper since 2011. On October 23, 2019, Trump announced that he was canceling the White House subscription to both \"The New York Times\" and \"The Washington Post\" and would direct all federal agencies to drop their subscriptions as well.\n\nCritic Matt Taibbi accused \"The New York Times\" of favoring Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the paper's news coverage of the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries. Responding to the complaints of many readers, \"The New York Times\" public editor Margaret Sullivan wrote that \"The Times has not ignored Mr. Sanders's campaign, but it hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.\" \"Times\" senior editor Carolyn Ryan defended both the volume of \"The New York Times\" coverage (noting that Sanders had received about the same amount of article coverage as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio) and its tone.\n\n\"The New York Times\" announced plans to eliminate copy editing roles from the production of its daily newspaper and website content in June 2018. Executive Editor Dean Baquet defended the cuts, saying that the \"Times\" needed to free up funds to hire more reporters by eliminating editing roles. (The opinion and magazine sections have still retained their copy editors.) The duties of copy editors —checking for style, grammar, factual correctness, tone, as well as writing headlines — were merged into all-purpose editing roles. Editors currently not only edit the content of the stories, but also, in many cases, provide the final read before publication. Many publications, such as the \"Chronicle of Higher Education\", have suggested the elimination of copy editors has led to more mistakes, such as typos and factual errors, in the paper. The journalism research organization similarly suggested in a blog post that the elimination of copy editors would decrease internal expertise and hurt the quality of the daily news report.\n\nThe \"Times\" has developed a national and international \"reputation for thoroughness\" over time. Among journalists, the paper is held in high regard; a 1999 survey of newspaper editors conducted by the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" found that the \"Times\" was the \"best\" American paper, ahead of \"The Washington Post\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Los Angeles Times\". The \"Times\" also was ranked in a 2011 \"quality\" ranking of U.S. newspapers by Daniel de Vise of \"The Washington Post\"; the objective ranking took into account the number of recent Pulitzer Prizes won, circulation, and perceived Web site quality. A 2012 report in WNYC called the \"Times\" \"the most respected newspaper in the world.\" Noam Chomsky, co-author of \"Manufacturing Consent\", said that \"The New York Times\" was the first thing he looked at in the morning: \"Despite all its flaws—and they're real—it still has the broadest, the most comprehensive coverage of I think any newspaper in the world.\"\n\nNevertheless, like many other U.S. media sources, the \"Times\" had suffered from a decline in public perceptions of credibility in the U.S. from 2004 to 2012. A Pew Research Center survey in 2012 asked respondents about their views on credibility of various news organizations. Among respondents who gave a rating, 49% said that they believed \"all or most\" of the \"Times\"s reporting, while 50% disagreed. A large percentage (19%) of respondents were unable to rate believability. The \"Times\"s score was comparable to that of \"USA Today\". Media analyst Brooke Gladstone of WNYC's \"On the Media\", writing for \"The New York Times\", says that the decline in U.S. public trust of the mass media can be explained (1) by the rise of the polarized Internet-driven news; (2) by a decline in trust in U.S. institutions more generally; and (3) by the fact that \"Americans say they want accuracy and impartiality, but the polls suggest that, actually, most of us are seeking affirmation.\"\n\n\"The New York Times\" has won 127 Pulitzer Prizes, more than any other newspaper. The prize is awarded for excellence in journalism in a range of categories.\n\nIt has also, , won three Peabody Awards and jointly received two.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "173070", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=173070", "title": "The Wall Street Journal", "text": "The Wall Street Journal\n\nThe Wall Street Journal is a U.S. business-focused, English-language international daily newspaper based in New York City, international editions also available in Chinese and Japanese. The \"Journal\", along with its Asian and European editions, is published six days a week by Dow Jones & Company, a division of News Corp. The newspaper is published in the broadsheet format and online. The \"Journal\" has been printed continuously since its inception on July 8, 1889, by Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser.\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" is one of the largest newspapers in the United States by circulation, with a circulation of about 2.834million copies (including nearly 1,829,000 digital sales) , compared with \"USA Today\"s 1.7million. The \"Journal\" publishes the luxury news and lifestyle magazine \"WSJ,\" which was originally launched as a quarterly but expanded to 12 issues as of 2014. An online version was launched in 1996, which has been accessible only to subscribers since it began.\n\nThe newspaper is known for its award-winning news coverage, and has won 37 Pulitzer Prizes (as of 2019). The editorial pages of the \"Journal\" are typically conservative in their position. The \"Journal\" editorial board has promoted pseudoscientific views on the science of climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion, as well as on the health harms of second-hand smoke, pesticides and asbestos.\n\nThe first products of Dow Jones & Company, the publisher of the \"Journal\", were brief news bulletins, nicknamed \"flimsies\", hand-delivered throughout the day to traders at the stock exchange in the early 1880s. They were later aggregated in a printed daily summary called the \"Customers' Afternoon Letter\". Reporters Charles Dow, Edward Jones, and Charles Bergstresser converted this into \"The Wall Street Journal\", which was published for the first time on July 8, 1889, and began delivery of the Dow Jones News Service via telegraph. In 1896, The \"Dow Jones Industrial Average\" was officially launched. It was the first of several indices of stock and bond prices on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1899, the \"Journal\" Review & Outlook column, which still runs today, appeared for the first time, initially written by Charles Dow.\n\nJournalist Clarence Barron purchased control of the company for US$130,000 in 1902; circulation was then around 7,000 but climbed to 50,000 by the end of the 1920s. Barron and his predecessors were credited with creating an atmosphere of fearless, independent financial reporting—a novelty in the early days of business journalism. In 1921, Barron's, the United States's premier financial weekly, was founded. Barron died in 1928, a year before Black Tuesday, the stock market crash that greatly affected the Great Depression in the United States. Barron's descendants, the Bancroft family, would continue to control the company until 2007.\n\nThe \"Journal\" took its modern shape and prominence in the 1940s, a time of industrial expansion for the United States and its financial institutions in New York. Bernard Kilgore was named managing editor of the paper in 1941, and company CEO in 1945, eventually compiling a 25-year career as the head of the \"Journal\". Kilgore was the architect of the paper's iconic front-page design, with its \"What's News\" digest, and its national distribution strategy, which brought the paper's circulation from 33,000 in 1941 to 1.1million when Kilgore died in 1967. Under Kilgore, in 1947, the paper won its first Pulitzer Prize for William Henry Grimes's editorials.\n\nIn 1967, Dow Jones Newswires began a major expansion outside of the United States ultimately placing its journalists in every major financial center in Europe, Asia, Latin America, Australia, and Africa. In 1970, Dow Jones bought the Ottaway newspaper chain, which at the time comprised nine dailies and three Sunday newspapers. Later, the name was changed to Dow Jones Local Media Group.\n\nThe period from 1971 to 1997 brought about a series of launches, acquisitions, and joint ventures, including \"Factiva\", \"The Wall Street Journal Asia\", \"The Wall Street Journal Europe\", the WSJ.com website, Dow Jones Indexes, MarketWatch, and \"WSJ Weekend Edition\". In 2007, News Corp. acquired Dow Jones. \"WSJ.\", a luxury lifestyle magazine, was launched in 2008.\n\nA complement to the print newspaper, \"The Wall Street Journal Online\", was launched in 1996 and has allowed access only by subscription from the beginning. In 2003, Dow Jones began to integrate reporting of the \"Journal\" print and online subscribers together in Audit Bureau of Circulations statements. In 2007, it was commonly believed to be the largest paid-subscription news site on the Web, with 980,000 paid subscribers. Since then, digital subscription has risen to 1.3 million as of September 2018, falling to number two behind \"The New York Times\" with 3 million digital subscriptions. In May 2008, an annual subscription to the online edition of \"The Wall Street Journal\" cost $119 for those who do not have subscriptions to the print edition. By June 2013, the monthly cost for a subscription to the online edition was $22.99, or $275.88 annually, excluding introductory offers. Digital subscription rates increased dramatically as its popularity increased over print to $443.88 per year, with first time subscribers paying $187.20 per year.\n\nOn November 30, 2004, Oasys Mobile and \"The Wall Street Journal\" released an app that would allow users to access content from \"The Wall Street Journal Online\" via their mobile phones.\n\nMany of \"The Wall Street Journal\" news stories are available through free online newspapers that subscribe to the Dow Jones syndicate. Pulitzer Prize–winning stories from 1995 are available free on the Pulitzer web site.\n\nIn September 2005, the \"Journal\" launched a weekend edition, delivered to all subscribers, which marked a return to Saturday publication after a lapse of some 50 years. The move was designed in part to attract more consumer advertising.\n\nIn 2005, the \"Journal\" reported a readership profile of about 60 percent top management, an average income of $191,000, an average household net worth of $2.1million, and an average age of 55.\n\nIn 2007, the \"Journal\" launched a worldwide expansion of its website to include major foreign-language editions. The paper had also shown an interest in buying the rival \"Financial Times\".\n\nThe nameplate is unique in having a period at the end.\n\nFront-page advertising in the \"Journal\" was re-introduced on September 5, 2006. This followed similar introductions in the European and Asian editions in late 2005.\n\nAfter presenting nearly identical front-page layouts for half a century—always six columns, with the day's top stories in the first and sixth columns, \"What's News\" digest in the second and third, the \"A-hed\" feature story in the fourth (with 'hed' being jargon for headline) and themed weekly reports in the fifth column – the paper in 2007 decreased its broadsheet width from 15 to 12inches while keeping the length at 22inches, to save newsprint costs. News design consultant Mario Garcia collaborated on the changes. Dow Jones said it would save US$18million a year in newsprint costs across all \"The Wall Street Journal\" papers. This move eliminated one column of print, pushing the \"A-hed\" out of its traditional location (though the paper now usually includes a quirky feature story on the right side of the front page, sandwiched among the lead stories).\n\nThe paper still uses ink dot drawings called hedcuts, introduced in 1979 and originally created by Kevin Sprouls, in addition to photographs, a method of illustration considered a consistent visual signature of the paper. The \"Journal\" still heavily employs the use of caricatures, including those by illustrator Ken Fallin, such as when Peggy Noonan memorialized then-recently deceased newsman Tim Russert. The use of color photographs and graphics has become increasingly common in recent years with the addition of more \"lifestyle\" sections.\n\nThe daily was awarded by the Society for News Design World's Best Designed Newspaper award for 1994 and 1997.\n\nOn May 2, 2007, News Corporation made an unsolicited takeover bid for Dow Jones, offering US$60 a share for stock that had been selling for US$33 a share. The Bancroft family, which controlled more than 60% of the voting stock, at first rejected the offer, but later reconsidered its position.\n\nThree months later, on August 1, 2007, News Corporation and Dow Jones entered into a definitive merger agreement. The US$5billion sale added \"The Wall Street Journal\" to Rupert Murdoch's news empire, which already included Fox News Channel, financial network unit and London's \"The Times\", and locally within New York, the \"New York Post\", along with Fox flagship station WNYW (Channel 5) and MyNetworkTV flagship WWOR (Channel 9).\n\nOn December 13, 2007, shareholders representing more than 60 percent of Dow Jones's voting stock approved the company's acquisition by News Corporation.\n\nIn an editorial page column, publisher L. Gordon Crovitz said the Bancrofts and News Corporation had agreed that the \"Journal\"s news and opinion sections would preserve their editorial independence from their new corporate parent:\n\nA special committee was established to oversee the paper's editorial integrity. When the managing editor Marcus Brauchli resigned on April 22, 2008, the committee said that News Corporation had violated its agreement by not notifying the committee earlier. However, Brauchli said he believed that new owners should appoint their own editor.\n\nA 2007 \"Journal\" article quoted charges that Murdoch had made and broken similar promises in the past. One large shareholder commented that Murdoch has long \"expressed his personal, political and business biases through his newspapers and television stations\". Former \"Times\" assistant editor Fred Emery remembers an incident when \"Mr. Murdoch called him into his office in March 1982 and said he was considering firing \"Times\" editor Harold Evans. Mr. Emery says he reminded Mr. Murdoch of his promise that editors couldn't be fired without the independent directors' approval.'God, you don't take all that seriously, do you?' Mr. Murdoch answered, according to Mr. Emery.\" Murdoch eventually forced out Evans.\n\nIn 2011, \"The Guardian\" found evidence that the \"Journal\" had artificially inflated its European sales numbers, by paying Executive Learning Partnership for purchasing 16% of European sales. These inflated sales numbers then enabled the \"Journal\" to charge similarly inflated advertising rates, as the advertisers would think that they reached more readers than they actually did. In addition, the \"Journal\" agreed to run \"articles\" featuring Executive Learning Partnership, presented as news, but effectively advertising. The case came to light after a Belgian \"Wall Street Journal\" employee, Gert Van Mol, informed Dow Jones CEO Les Hinton about the questionable practice. As a result, the then \"Wall Street Journal Europe\" CEO and Publisher Andrew Langhoff was fired after it was found out he personally pressured journalists into covering one of the newspaper's business partners involved in the issue. Since September 2011, all the online articles that resulted from the ethical wrongdoing carry a \"Wall Street Journal\" disclaimer informing the readers about the circumstances in which they were created.\n\nThe \"Journal\", along with its parent Dow Jones & Company, was among the businesses News Corporation spun off in 2013 as the new News Corp. In November 2016, in an effort to cut costs, the \"Journal\" editor-in-chief, Gerard Baker, announced that layoffs and consolidation to its sections would take place. In the memo, the new format for the newspaper will have a \"Business & Finance\" section that will combine its current \"Business & Tech\" and \"Money & Investing\" sections. It will also include a new \"Life & Arts\" section that will combine its current \"Personal Journal\" and \"Arena\" sections. In addition, the current \"Greater New York\" coverage will be reduced and will move into the main section of paper.\n\n\nSince 1980, the \"Journal\" has been published in multiple sections. At one time, The \"Journal\" page count averaged as much as 96 pages an issue, but with the industry-wide decline in advertising, the Journal in 2009–10 more typically published about 50 to 60 pages per issue.\n\n, \"The Wall Street Journal\" had a global news staff of around 2,000 journalists in\n85 news bureaus across 51 countries. , it had 26 printing plants.\n\nRegularly scheduled sections are:\n\n\nIn addition, several columnists contribute regular features to the \"Journal\" opinion page and OpinionJournal.com:\n\nIn addition to these regular opinion pieces, on Fridays the Journal publishes a religion-themed op-ed, titled \"Houses of Worship\",\nwritten by a different author each week. Authors range from the Dalai Lama to cardinals.\n\n\"WSJ.\" is \"The Wall Street Journal\"s luxury lifestyle magazine. Its coverage spans art, fashion, entertainment, design, food, architecture, travel and more. Kristina O'Neill is Editor in Chief and Anthony Cenname is Publisher.\n\nLaunched as a quarterly in 2008, the magazine grew to 12 issues a year for 2014. The magazine is distributed within the U.S. Weekend Edition of \"The Wall Street Journal\" newspaper (average paid print circulation is +2.2 million*), the European and Asian editions, and is available on WSJ.com. Each issue is also available throughout the month in \"The Wall Street Journal\" iPad app.\n\nPenélope Cruz, Carmelo Anthony, Woody Allen, Scarlett Johansson, Emilia Clarke, Daft Punk, and Gisele Bündchen have all been featured on the cover.\n\nIn 2012, the magazine launched its signature platform, The Innovator Awards. An extension of the November Innovators issue, the awards ceremony, held in New York City at Museum of Modern Art, honors visionaries across the fields of design, fashion, architecture, humanitarianism, art and technology. The 2013 winners were: Alice Waters (Humanitarianism); Daft Punk (Entertainment); David Adjaye (Architecture); Do Ho Su (Art); Nick D'Aloisio (Technology); Pat McGrath (Fashion); Thomas Woltz (Design).\n\nIn 2013, \"Adweek\" awarded \"WSJ.\" \"Hottest Lifestyle Magazine of the Year\" for its annual Hot List.\n\n\n\"The Wall Street Journal\" editorial board members oversee the \"Journal's\" editorial page and represent the newspaper and its editorial page publicly. \"The Wall Street Journal\" does not provide details on the exact duties of board members.\n\nEvery Saturday and Sunday, three editorial page writers and host Paul Gigot, editor of the Editorial Page, appear on Fox News Channel's \"Journal Editorial Report\" to discuss current issues with a variety of guests. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958–1971) and Robert L. Bartley (served 1972–2000) were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis.\n\nThe \"Journal\" won its first two Pulitzer Prizes for editorial writing in 1947 and 1953. Subsequent Pulitzer Prizes have been awarded for editorial writing to Robert L. Bartley in 1980 and Joseph Rago in 2011; for criticism to Manuela Hoelterhoff in 1983 and Joe Morgenstern in 2005; and for commentary to Vermont Royster in 1984, Paul Gigot in 2000, Dorothy Rabinowitz in 2001, Bret Stephens in 2013, and Peggy Noonan in 2017.\n\nThe \"Journal\" describes the history of its editorials:\nIts historical position was much the same. As former editor William H. Grimes wrote in 1951:\nEach Thanksgiving the editorial page prints two articles that have appeared there since 1961. The first is titled \"The Desolate Wilderness\", and describes what the Pilgrims saw when they arrived at the Plymouth Colony. The second is titled \"And the Fair Land\", and describes the bounty of America. It was written by a former editor, Vermont C. Royster, whose Christmas article \"In Hoc Anno Domini\" has appeared every December 25 since 1949.\n\nTwo summaries published in 1995 by the progressive blog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting, and in 1996 by the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" criticized the \"Journal\" editorial page for inaccuracy during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nDuring the Reagan administration, the newspaper's editorial page was particularly influential as the leading voice for supply-side economics. Under the editorship of Robert Bartley, it expounded at length on economic concepts such as the Laffer curve, and how a decrease in certain marginal tax rates and the capital gains tax could allegedly increase overall tax revenue by generating more economic activity.\n\nIn the economic argument of exchange rate regimes (one of the most divisive issues among economists), the \"Journal\" has a tendency to support fixed exchange rates over floating exchange rates. For example, the \"Journal\" was a major supporter of the Chinese yuan's peg to the dollar, and strongly disagreed with American politicians who criticized the Chinese government about the peg. It opposed China's move to let the yuan gradually float, arguing that the fixed rate benefited both the United States and China.\n\nThe \"Journal\" views compare with those of the British publication \"The Economist\", with its emphasis on free markets. However, the \"Journal\" demonstrates important distinctions from European business newspapers, most particularly in regard to the relative significance of, and causes of, the American budget deficit. (The \"Journal\" generally points to the lack of foreign growth, while business journals in Europe and Asia blame the low savings rate and concordant high borrowing rate in the United States).\n\nOn September 12, 2018, the Census Bureau released data showing improvement in household income and the poverty rate during 2017, Trump's first year in office. \"The Journal\" published an editorial that day attributing the improvement to Trump's purportedly superior economic policies, compared to Obama's. However, \"The Journal\"s news division reported that both figures also showed improvement in 2015 and 2016, and they improved to a greater degree in both those years than they did in 2017.\n\nThe \"Journal\" editorial pages and columns, run separately from the news pages, have a conservative bent and are highly influential in American conservative circles. Despite this, the \"Journal\" refrains from endorsing candidates and has not endorsed a candidate since 1928. As editors of the editorial page, Vermont C. Royster (served 1958–1971) and Robert L. Bartley (served 1972–2000) were especially influential in providing a conservative interpretation of the news on a daily basis. Some of the \"Journal\" former reporters claim that the paper has adopted a more conservative tone since Rupert Murdoch's purchase.\n\nThe editorial board has long argued for a pro-business immigration policy. In a July 3, 1984, editorial, the board wrote: \"If Washington still wants to 'do something' about immigration, we propose a five-word constitutional amendment: There shall be open borders.\" This stand on immigration reform places the \"Journal\" in contrast to most conservative activists, politicians, and media publications, such as \"National Review\" and \"The Washington Times\", who favor heightened restrictions on immigration.\n\nThe \"Journal\" editorial page has been seen as critical of many aspects of Barack Obama's presidency. In particular, it has been a prominent critic of the Affordable Care Act legislation passed in 2010, and has featured many opinion columns attacking various aspects of the bill. The \"Journal\" editorial page has also criticized the Obama administration's energy policies and foreign policy.\n\nOn October 25, 2017, the editorial board called for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to resign from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and accused Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign of colluding with Russia. In December 2017, the editorial board repeated its calls for Mueller's resignation. The editorials by the editorial board caused fractures within the \"Wall Street Journal\", as reporters say that the editorials undermine the paper's credibility.\n\nThe \"Journal\" editorial board has promoted fringe views on scientific matters, including climate change, acid rain, and ozone depletion, as well as on the health harms of second-hand smoke, pesticides and asbestos. Scholars have drawn similarities between the \"Journal\"'s fringe coverage of climate change and how it used to reject the settled science on acid rain and ozone depletion.\n\nThe editorial board of \"The Wall Street Journal\" rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. The \"Journal\" disputes that it poses a major threat to human existence and can be prevented through public policy. The \"Journal\" has published articles disputing that global warming is occurring at all. \"The Journal\" is regarded as a forum for climate change deniers, publishing articles by individuals that reject the consensus position on climate change in its op-ed section. These columns frequently attack climate scientists and accuse them of engaging in fraud. A 2015 study found \"The Wall Street Journal\" was the newspaper that was least likely to present negative effects of global warming among several newspapers. It was also the most likely to present negative economic framing when discussing climate change mitigation policies, tending to take the stance that the cost of such policies generally outweighs their benefit. \"The Washington Post\" has characterized the \"Wall Street Journal\"’s editorial pages as \"the beating heart of climate-change skepticism.\"\n\nClimate Feedback, a fact-checking website on media coverage of climate science, has assessed that multiple opinion articles range between \"low\" and \"very low\" in terms of scientific credibility. The \"Journal\" has been accused of refusing to publish opinions of scientists which present the mainstream view on climate change. According to a 2016 analysis, 14% of the guest editorials presented the results of \"mainstream climate science\", while the majority did not. Also, none of 201 editorials published in the WSJ since 1997 have conceded that the burning of fossil fuels is causing climate change.\n\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, the \"Journal\" published numerous columns disputing and misrepresenting the science behind acid rain and the scientific consensus behind the causes of ozone depletion and the health harms of second-hand smoke, and opposed public policy efforts to curb acid rain, ozone depletion and second-hand smoke. The \"Journal\" has also published columns attacking efforts to control pesticides and asbestos. By the 2000s, the \"Journal\" editorial board recognized that efforts to curb acid rain through cap-and-trade had been successful.\n\nThe \"Journal\"s editors stress the independence and impartiality of their reporters. According to CNN in 2007, the \"Journal\"'s \"newsroom staff has a reputation for non-partisan reporting.\"\n\nIn a 2004 study, Tim Groseclose and Jeff Milyo argue the \"Journal\" news pages have a pro-liberal bias because they more often quote liberal think tanks. They calculated the ideological attitude of news reports in 20 media outlets by counting the frequency they cited particular think tanks and comparing that to the frequency that legislators cited the same think tanks. They found that the news reporting of \"The Journal\" was the most liberal (more liberal than NPR or \"The New York Times\"). The study did not factor in editorials. Mark Liberman criticized the model used to calculate bias in the study and argued that the model unequally affected liberals and conservatives and that \"..the model starts with a very peculiar assumption about the relationship between political opinion and the choice of authorities to cite.\" [The authors assume that] \"think tank ideology [...] only matters to liberals.\"\n\nThe company's planned and eventual acquisition by News Corp in 2007 led to significant media criticism and discussion about whether the news pages would exhibit a rightward slant under Rupert Murdoch. An August 1 editorial responded to the questions by asserting that Murdoch intended to \"maintain the values and integrity of the \"Journal\".\"\n\nThe \"Journal\" has won 37 Pulitzer Prizes in its history. Staff journalists who led some of the newspaper's best-known coverage teams have later published books that summarized and extended their reporting.\n\nIn 1987, a bidding war ensued between several financial firms for tobacco and food giant RJR Nabisco. Bryan Burrough and John Helyar documented the events in more than two dozen \"Journal\" articles. Burrough and Helyar later used these articles as the basis of a bestselling book, \"\", which was turned into a film for HBO.\n\nIn the 1980s, then \"Journal\" reporter James B. Stewart brought national attention to the illegal practice of insider trading. He was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in explanatory journalism in 1988, which he shared with Daniel Hertzberg, who went on to serve as the paper's senior deputy managing editor before resigning in 2009. Stewart expanded on this theme in his book, \"Den of Thieves\".\n\nDavid Sanford, a Page One features editor who was infected with HIV in 1982 in a bathhouse, wrote a front-page personal account of how, with the assistance of improved treatments for HIV, he went from planning his death to planning his retirement. He and six other reporters wrote about the new treatments, political and economic issues, and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting about AIDS.\n\nJonathan Weil, a reporter at the Dallas bureau of \"The Wall Street Journal\", is credited with first breaking the story of financial abuses at Enron in September 2000. Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller reported on the story regularly, and wrote a book, \"24 Days\".\n\nThe \"Journal\" claims to have sent the first news report, on the Dow Jones wire, of a plane crashing into the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Its headquarters, at One World Financial Center, was severely damaged by the collapse of the World Trade Center just across the street. Top editors worried that they might miss publishing the first issue for the first time in the paper's 112-year history. They relocated to a makeshift office at an editor's home, while sending most of the staff to Dow Jones's South Brunswick Township, New Jersey, corporate campus, where the paper had established emergency editorial facilities soon after the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. The paper was on the stands the next day, albeit in scaled-down form. Perhaps the most compelling story in that day's edition was a first-hand account of the Twin Towers' collapse written by then-Foreign Editor John Bussey, who holed up in a ninth-floor Journal office, literally in the shadow of the towers, from where he phoned in live reports to CNBC as the towers burned. He narrowly escaped serious injury when the first tower collapsed, shattering all the windows in the \"Journal\" offices and filling them with dust and debris. The \"Journal\" won a 2002 Pulitzer Prize in Breaking News Reporting for that day's stories.\n\nThe \"Journal\" subsequently conducted a worldwide investigation of the causes and significance of 9/11, using contacts it had developed while covering business in the Arab world. In Kabul, Afghanistan, a reporter from \"The Wall Street Journal\" bought a pair of looted computers that Al Qaeda leaders had used to plan assassinations, chemical and biological attacks, and mundane daily activities. The encrypted files were decrypted and translated. It was during this coverage that terrorists kidnapped and killed \"Journal\" reporter Daniel Pearl.\n\nIn 2007, the paper won the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service, with its iconic Gold Medal, for exposing companies that illegally backdate stock options they awarded executives to increase their value.\n\nKate Kelly wrote a three-part series that detailed events that led to the collapse of Bear Stearns.\n\nA report published on September 30, 2010, detailing allegations McDonald's had plans to drop health coverage for hourly employees drew criticism from McDonald's as well as the Obama administration. The Wall Street Journal reported the plan to drop coverage stemmed from new health care requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. McDonald's called the report \"speculative and misleading\", stating they had no plans to drop coverage. The Wall Street Journal report and subsequent rebuttal received coverage from several other media outlets.\n\nIn 2015, a report published by the \"Journal\" alleged that up to US$700 million was wired from 1MDB, a Malaysian state investment company, to the personal accounts of Malaysia Prime Minister Najib Razak at AmBank, the fifth largest lender in Malaysia. Razak responded by threatening to sue the New York-based newspaper.\n\nThe report prompted some governmental agencies in Malaysia to conduct an investigation into the allegation.\n\nIn 2015, a report written by the \"Journal\" John Carreyrou alleged that blood testing company Theranos' technology was faulty and founder Elizabeth Holmes was misleading investors. According to \"Vanity Fair\", \"a damning report published in \"The Wall Street Journal\" had alleged that the company was, in effect, a sham—that its vaunted core technology was actually faulty and that Theranos administered almost all of its blood tests using competitors' equipment.\" The \"Journal\" has subsequently published several more reports questioning Theranos' and Holmes' credibility. On June 15, 2018, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California announced the indictment of Holmes on wire fraud and conspiracy charges in relation to her role as CEO of Theranos.\n\nElizabeth Holmes asked Rupert Murdoch —- who at the time was a major investor in Theranos and owner of the \"Journal\" — to \"personally kill\" an investigative piece being written about Theranos. Murdoch refused, instead stating that he \"had confidence in editors to handle the truth - whatever it may be\". Murdoch went on to lose approximately $100 million in his investments in Theranos.\n\nOn January 12, 2018, Michael Rothfeld and Joe Palazzolo reported in the \"Wall Street Journal\" that during the 2016 presidential campaign, then-candidate Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen coordinated a $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels for her silence regarding an alleged affair. In subsequent reports, the method of payment and many other details were extensively covered. In April of that year, FBI agents stormed the home of Michael Cohen seizing records related to the transaction. In August 21, 2018, Cohen pleaded guilty to eight counts including campaign finance violations in connection with the Daniels payment. The coverage earned them the 2019 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "102226", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=102226", "title": "The Washington Post", "text": "The Washington Post\n\nThe Washington Post (sometimes abbreviated to WaPo) is a major American daily newspaper published in Washington, D.C. Daily broadsheet editions are printed for the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia.\n\nThe newspaper has won 47 Pulitzer Prizes. This includes six separate Pulitzers awarded in 2008, second only to \"The New York Times\"s seven awards in 2002 for the highest number ever awarded to a single newspaper in one year. \"Post\" journalists have also received 18 Nieman Fellowships and 368 White House News Photographers Association awards. In the early 1970s, in the best-known episode in the newspaper's history, reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein led the American press's investigation into what became known as the Watergate scandal. Their reporting in \"The Washington Post\" greatly contributed to the resignation of President Richard Nixon. In years since, the \"Post\"s investigations have led to increased review of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n\nIn October 2013, the paper's longtime controlling family, the Graham family, sold the newspaper to Nash Holdings, a holding company established by Jeff Bezos, for $250 million in cash.\n\n\"The Washington Post\" is regarded as one of the leading daily American newspapers along with \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", and \"The Wall Street Journal\". The \"Post\" has distinguished itself through its political reporting on the workings of the White House, Congress, and other aspects of the U.S. government.\n\nUnlike \"The New York Times\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The Washington Post\" does not print an edition for distribution away from the East Coast. In 2009, the newspaper ceased publication of its \"National Weekly Edition\", which combined stories from the week's print editions, due to shrinking circulation. The majority of its newsprint readership is in the District of Columbia and its suburbs in Maryland and Northern Virginia.\n\nThe newspaper is one of a few U.S. newspapers with foreign bureaus, located in Beirut, Berlin, Beijing, Bogotá, Cairo, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, and Tokyo. In November 2009, it announced the closure of its U.S. regional bureaus—Chicago, Los Angeles and New York—as part of an increased focus on \"political stories and local news coverage in Washington.\" The newspaper has local bureaus in Maryland (Annapolis, Montgomery County, Prince George's County, Southern Maryland) and Virginia (Alexandria, Fairfax, Loudoun County, Richmond, and Prince William County).\n\n, its average weekday circulation was 474,767, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, making it the seventh largest newspaper in the country by circulation, behind \"USA Today\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", \"The New York Times\", the \"Los Angeles Times\", the \"Daily News\", and the \"New York Post\". While its circulation (like that of almost all newspapers) has been slipping, it has one of the highest market-penetration rates of any metropolitan news daily.\n\nFor many decades, the \"Post\" had its main office at 1150 15th Street NW. This real estate remained with Graham Holdings when the newspaper was sold to Jeff Bezos' Nash Holdings in 2013. Graham Holdings sold 1150 15th Street (along with 1515 L Street, 1523 L Street, and land beneath 1100 15th Street) for in November 2013. \"The Washington Post\" continued to lease space at 1150 L Street NW. In May 2014, \"The Washington Post\" leased the west tower of One Franklin Square, a high-rise building at 1301 K Street NW in Washington, D.C. The newspaper moved into its new offices on December 14, 2015.\n\nThe \"Post\" has its own exclusive zip code, 20071.\n\nArc Publishing is a department of \"The Washington Post\", which provides the publishing system Arc, software for news organizations such as the \"Chicago Tribune\" and the \"Los Angeles Times\".\n\nThe newspaper was founded in 1877 by Stilson Hutchins (18381912), and in 1880 it added a Sunday edition, becoming the city's first newspaper to publish seven days a week.\n\nIn April 1878, about four months into publication, \"The Washington Post\" purchased \"The Washington Union\", a competing newspaper which was founded by John Lynch in late 1877. The \"Union\" had only been in operation about six months at the time of the acquisition. The combined newspaper was published from the Globe Building as \"The Washington Post and Union\" beginning on April 15, 1878, with a circulation of 13,000. The \"Post and Union\" name was used about two weeks until April 29, 1878, returning to the original masthead the following day.\n\nIn 1889, Hutchins sold the newspaper to Frank Hatton, a former Postmaster General, and Beriah Wilkins, a former Democratic congressman from Ohio. To promote the newspaper, the new owners requested the leader of the United States Marine Band, John Philip Sousa, to compose a march for the newspaper's essay contest awards ceremony. Sousa composed \"The Washington Post\". It became the standard music to accompany the two-step, a late 19th-century dance craze, and remains one of Sousa's best-known works.\n\nIn 1893, the newspaper moved to a building at 14th and E streets NW, where it would remain until 1950. This building combined all functions of the newspaper into one headquarters – newsroom, advertising, typesetting, and printing – that ran 24 hours per day.\n\nIn 1898, during the Spanish–American War, the \"Post\" printed Clifford K. Berryman's classic illustration \"Remember the Maine\", which became the battle-cry for American sailors during the War. In 1902, Berryman published another famous cartoon in the \"Post\" – \"Drawing the Line in Mississippi\". This cartoon depicts President Theodore Roosevelt showing compassion for a small bear cub and inspired New York store owner Morris Michtom to create the teddy bear.\n\nWilkins acquired Hatton's share of the newspaper in 1894 at Hatton's death. After Wilkins' death in 1903, his sons John and Robert ran the \"Post\" for two years before selling it in 1905 to John Roll McLean, owner of the \"Cincinnati Enquirer\". During the Wilson presidency, the \"Post\" was credited with the \"most famous newspaper typo\" in D.C. history according to \"Reason\" magazine; the \"Post\" intended to report that President Wilson had been \"entertaining\" his future-wife Mrs. Galt, but instead wrote that he had been \"entering\" Mrs. Galt.\n\nWhen John McLean died in 1916, he put the newspaper in trust, having little faith that his playboy son Edward \"Ned\" McLean could manage his inheritance. Ned went to court and broke the trust, but, under his management, the newspaper slumped toward ruin. He bled the paper for his lavish lifestyle, and used it to promote political agendas.\n\nDuring the Red Summer of 1919 the Post supported the white mobs and even ran a front page story which advertised the location at which white servicemen were planning to meet to carry out attacks on black Washingtonians.\n\nIn 1929, financier Eugene Meyer (who had run the War Finance Corp. since World War I) secretly made an offer of $5 million for the \"Post,\" but he was rebuffed by Ned McLean. On June 1, 1933, Meyer bought the paper at a bankruptcy auction for $825,000 three weeks after stepping down as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. He had bid anonymously, and was prepared to go up to $2 million, far higher than the other bidders. These included William Randolph Hearst, who had long hoped to shut down the ailing \"Post\" to benefit his own Washington newspaper presence.\n\nThe \"Post\"s health and reputation were restored under Meyer's ownership. In 1946, he was succeeded as publisher by his son-in-law, Philip Graham. Meyer eventually gained the last laugh over Hearst, who had owned the old \"Washington Times\" and the \"Herald\" before their 1939 merger that formed the \"Times-Herald.\" This was in turn bought by and merged into the \"Post\" in 1954. The combined paper was officially named \"The Washington Post and Times-Herald\" until 1973, although the \"Times-Herald\" portion of the nameplate became less and less prominent over time. The merger left the \"Post\" with two remaining local competitors, the \"Washington Star\" (\"Evening Star\") and \"The Washington Daily News\" which merged in 1972, forming the \"Washington Star-News.\" This had again become simply the \"Washington Star\" by the time it closed on August 7, 1981, leaving the \"Post\" as the only major daily in Washington for almost a year.\nOn May 17, 1982, Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon began publishing the current \"Washington Times\", a conservative daily broadsheet whose circulation has only ever been a fraction of its rival, the \"Post\". In 2005, conservative competition increased slightly with the founding of the \"Washington Examiner\", originally a free tabloid daily, which switched to a weekly magazine format in 2013. But the \"Post\", with a far larger presence, locally and nationally, has remained Washington's dominant paper since the 1950s.\n\nAfter Phil Graham's death in 1963, control of The Washington Post Company passed to his wife Katharine Graham (19172001), who was also Eugene Meyer's daughter. Few women had run prominent national newspapers in the United States. Katharine Graham described her own anxiety and lack of confidence based on her gender in her autobiography. She served as publisher from 1969 to 1979 and headed The Washington Post Company into the early 1990s as chairman of the board and CEO. After 1993, she retained a position as chairman of the executive committee until her death in 2001.\n\nHer tenure is credited with seeing the newspaper rise in national stature through effective investigative reporting after it began to live down its reputation as a house organ for the Kennedy and Johnson administration, working to ensure that \"The New York Times\" did not surpass its Washington reporting of the Pentagon Papers and Watergate scandal.\n\nGraham took The Washington Post Company public on June 15, 1971, in the midst of the Pentagon Papers controversy. A total of 1,294,000 shares were offered to the public at $26 per share. By the end of Graham's tenure as CEO in 1991, the stock was worth $888 per share, not counting the effect of an intermediate 4:1 stock split.\n\nDuring this time, Graham also oversaw the Post company's diversification purchase of the for-profit education and training company Kaplan, Inc. for $40 million in 1984. Twenty years later, Kaplan had surpassed the \"Post\" newspaper as the company's leading contributor to income, and by 2010 Kaplan accounted for more than 60% of the entire company revenue stream.\n\nExecutive editor Ben Bradlee put the newspaper's reputation and resources behind reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, who, in a long series of articles, chipped away at the story behind the 1972 burglary of Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate complex in Washington. The \"Post\" dogged coverage of the story, the outcome of which ultimately played a major role in the resignation of President Richard Nixon, won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.\n\nIn 1972, the \"Book World\" section was introduced with Pulitzer Prize–winning critic William McPherson as its first editor. It featured Pulitzer Prize–winning critics such as Jonathan Yardley and Michael Dirda, the latter of whom established his career as a critic at the \"Post\". In 2009, after 37 years, with great reader outcries and protest, \"The Washington Post Book World\" as a standalone insert was discontinued, the last issue being Sunday, February 15, 2009, along with a general reorganization of the paper, such as placing the Sunday editorials on the back page of the main front section rather than the \"Outlook\" section and distributing some other locally oriented \"op-ed\" letters and commentaries in other sections. However, book reviews are still published in the Outlook section on Sundays and in the Style section the rest of the week, as well as online.\n\nIn 1975, the pressmen's union went on strike. The \"Post\" hired replacement workers to replace the pressmen's union, and other unions returned to work in February 1976.\n\nIn 1980, the newspaper published a dramatic story called \"Jimmy's World\", describing the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict in Washington, for which reporter Janet Cooke won acclaim and a Pulitzer Prize. Subsequent investigation, however, revealed the story to be a fabrication. The Pulitzer Prize was returned.\n\nDonald E. Graham, Katharine's son, succeeded her as publisher in 1979 and in the early 1990s became both chief executive officer and chairman of the board. He was succeeded in 2000 as publisher and CEO by Boisfeuillet Jones Jr., with Graham remaining as chairman.\n\nIn 1995 the domain name washingtonpost.com was purchased. That same year, a failed effort to create an online news repository called Digital Ink launched. The following year it was shut down and the first website was launched in June 1996.\n\nKatharine Weymouth, Donald Graham's niece, served as publisher and chief executive officer from 2008 until 2014, when Jeff Bezos took over ownership of the paper.\n\nIn 2013 Jeff Bezos purchased the paper for cash. The newspaper is now owned by Nash Holdings LLC controlled by Bezos. The sale also included some other local publications, websites and real estate. After the sale the Washington Post Co. became Graham Holdings Company\n\nBezos said he has a vision that recreates \"the 'daily ritual' of reading the \"Post\" as a bundle, not merely a series of individual stories...\" He has been described as a \"hands-off owner,\" holding teleconference calls with executive editor Martin Baron every two weeks. Bezos appointed Fred Ryan (founder and CEO of \"Politico\") to serve as publisher and chief executive officer. This signaled Bezos’ intent to shift the \"Post\" to a more digital focus with a national and global readership.\n\nIn 2014, the \"Post\" announced it was moving from 1150 15th Street to a leased space three blocks away at One Franklin Square on K Street. In recent years the \"Post\" launched an online personal finance section, as well as a blog and a podcast with a retro theme.\n\nWhen financier Eugene Meyer bought the bankrupt \"Post\" in 1933, he assured the public he wouldn't be beholden to any party. But as a leading Republican (it was his old friend Herbert Hoover who had made him Fed Chairman in 1930), his opposition to FDR's New Deal colored the paper's editorial stance as well as its news coverage. This included editorializing \"news\" stories written by Meyer under a pseudonym. His wife Agnes Ernst Meyer was a journalist from the other end of the spectrum politically. The \"Post\" ran many of her pieces including tributes to her personal friends John Dewey and Saul Alinsky.\n\nEugene Meyer became head of the World Bank in 1946, and he named his son-in-law Phil Graham to succeed him as \"Post\" publisher. The post-war years saw the developing friendship of Phil and Kay Graham with the Kennedys, the Bradlees and the rest of the \"Georgetown Set\" (many Harvard alumni) that would color the \"Post's\" political orientation. Kay Graham's most memorable Georgetown soirée guest list included British diplomat/communist spy Donald Maclean.\n\nThe \"Post\" is credited with inventing the term \"McCarthyism\" in a 1950 editorial cartoon by Herbert Block. Depicting buckets of tar, it made fun of Sen. Joseph McCarthy's \"tarring\" tactics, i.e., smear campaigns and character assassination against those targeted by his accusations. Sen. McCarthy was attempting to do for the Senate what the House Un-American Activities Committee had been doing for years—investigating Soviet espionage in America. The HUAC made Richard Nixon nationally known for his role in the Hiss/Chambers case that exposed communist spying in the State Department. The committee had evolved from the McCormack-Dickstein Committee of the 1930s.\n\nPhil Graham's friendship with JFK remained strong until their untimely deaths in 1963. FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover reportedly told the new President Lyndon B. Johnson, \"I don't have much influence with the \"Post\" because I frankly don't read it. I view it like the \"Daily Worker\".\"\n\nBen Bradlee became the editor-in-chief in 1968, and Kay Graham officially became the publisher in 1969, paving the way for the aggressive reporting of the \"Pentagon Papers\" and Watergate scandals. In the mid-1970s, some conservatives referred to the \"Post\" as \"\"Pravda\" on the Potomac\" because of its perceived left-wing bias in both reporting and editorials. Since then, the appellation has been used by both liberal and conservative critics of the newspaper.\n\nIn the PBS documentary \"Buying the War\", journalist Bill Moyers said in the year prior to the Iraq War there were 27 editorials supporting the Bush administration's ambitions to invade the country. National security correspondent Walter Pincus reported that he had been ordered to cease his reports that were critical of the administration. According to author and journalist Greg Mitchell: \"By the \"Post\" own admission, in the months before the war, it ran more than 140 stories on its front page promoting the war, while contrary information got lost\".\n\nOn March 26, 2007, Chris Matthews said on his television program, \"Well, \"The Washington Post\" is not the liberal newspaper it was, Congressman, let me tell you. I have been reading it for years and it is a neocon newspaper\". It has regularly published a mixture of op-ed columnists, with some of them left-leaning (including E. J. Dionne, Dana Milbank, Greg Sargent, and Eugene Robinson), and some of them right-leaning (including George Will, Marc Thiessen, Michael Gerson and Charles Krauthammer).\n\nIn a study published on April 18, 2007, by Yale professors Alan Gerber, Dean Karlan, and Daniel Bergan, citizens were given a subscription to either the conservative-leaning \"Washington Times\" or the liberal-leaning \"Washington Post\" to see the effect that media has on voting patterns. Gerber had estimated based on his work that the \"Post\" slanted as much to the left as the \"Times\" did to the right. Gerber found those who were given a free subscription of the \"Post\" were 7.9–11.4% more likely to vote for the Democratic candidate for governor than those assigned to the control group, depending on the adjustment for the date on which individual participants were surveyed and the survey interviewer; however, people who received the \"Times\" were also more likely than controls to vote for the Democrat, with an effect approximately 60% as large as that estimated for the \"Post\". The study authors said that sampling error might have played a role in the effect of the conservative-leaning \"Times\", as might the fact that the Democratic candidate took more conservative-leaning positions than is typical for his party, and \"the month prior to the post-election survey was a difficult period for President Bush, one in which his overall approval rating fell by approximately 4 percentage points nationwide. It appears that heightened exposure to both papers’ news coverage, despite opposing ideological slants, moved public opinion away from Republicans.\"\n\nIn November 2007, the newspaper was criticized by independent journalist Robert Parry for reporting on anti-Obama chain e-mails without sufficiently emphasizing to its readers the false nature of the anonymous claims. In 2009, Parry criticized the newspaper for its allegedly unfair reporting on liberal politicians, including Vice President Al Gore and President Barack Obama.\n\nResponding to criticism of the newspaper's coverage during the run-up to the 2008 presidential election, former \"Post\" ombudsman Deborah Howell wrote: \"The opinion pages have strong conservative voices; the editorial board includes centrists and conservatives; and there were editorials critical of Obama. Yet opinion was still weighted toward Obama.\" According to a 2009 Oxford University Press book by Richard Davis on the impact of blogs on American politics, liberal bloggers link to \"The Washington Post\" and \"The New York Times\" more often than other major newspapers; however, conservative bloggers also link predominantly to liberal newspapers.\n\nIn mid-September 2016, Matthew Ingram of \"Forbes\" joined Glenn Greenwald of \"The Intercept\", and Trevor Trimm of \"The Guardian\" in criticizing \"The Washington Post\" for \"demanding that [former National Security Agency contractor Edward] Snowden ... stand trial on espionage charges\".\n\nIn December 2016, The \"Post\" published a story inaccurately stating that a Russian hacking operation had infiltrated the U.S. electrical grid; the claim was retracted in a revised version of the story, after the initial version had been widely circulated.\n\nIn February 2017, the \"Post\" adopted the slogan \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" for its masthead.\n\nSince 2011, the \"Post\" has been running a column called \"The Fact Checker\" that the \"Post\" describes as a \"truth squad.\" The Fact Checker received a $250,000 grant from Google News Initiative/YouTube to expand production of video fact checks.\n\nKatharine Graham wrote in her autobiography \"Personal History\" that the newspaper long had a policy of not making endorsements for political candidates. However, since at least 2000, the newspaper has occasionally endorsed Republican politicians, such as Maryland Governor Robert Ehrlich. In 2006, it repeated its historic endorsements of every Republican incumbent for Congress in Northern Virginia. There have also been times when the \"Post\" has specifically chosen not to endorse any candidate, such as in the 1988 presidential election when it refused to endorse then-Governor Michael Dukakis or then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. On October 17, 2008, the \"Post\" endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. On October 25, 2012, the newspaper endorsed the Obama's re-election. The \"Post\" has endorsed Democrats for president during at least nine different presidential elections. The paper has never endorsed a Republican for president. On October 21, 2014, the newspaper endorsed 44 Democratic candidates versus 3 Republican candidates for the 2014 elections in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia. On October 13, 2016, it endorsed Hillary Clinton for that year's presidential election.\n\nThe \"Post\" endorsed Maryland Governor Harry Hughes and D.C. Mayor Marion Barry in the 1978 elections.\n\nIn September 1980, a Sunday feature story appeared on the front page of the \"Post\" titled \"Jimmy's World\" in which reporter Janet Cooke wrote a profile of the life of an eight-year-old heroin addict. Although some within the \"Post\" doubted the story's veracity, the paper's editors defended it, and assistant managing editor Bob Woodward submitted the story to the Pulitzer Prize Board at Columbia University for consideration. Cooke was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Writing on April 13, 1981. The story was then found to be a complete fabrication, and the Pulitzer was returned.\n\nOn July 15, 2019, a major US civil rights organization, The Color of Change, which claims to have 1.4 million members, called on the Post to fire columnist Richard Cohen, who stated in a recent editorial that ‘people with conventional views’ are challenged by New York City Mayor-elect Bill de Blasio's interracial marriage and family, to the point that the average person would have to suppress their ‘gag reflex’ when seeing them on TV. The Color of Change asked \"Since when did the editors of one of our nation’s premier newspapers become the arbiters of conventional, or traditional, American views? And since they have decided to play that role, how did they come to the decision that, in 2013, the average American is disturbed by the sight of an interracial family—to the point of running for the barf bag?\"\n\nOn November 9, 2018, a \"Washington Post\" op-ed written by Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, a political leader in Houthi movement, was published. This led \"The Washington Post\" to be criticized by multiple activists on the basis of providing a platform to an \"anti-Western and antisemitic group supported by Iran\". Both Iran and the Houthis have denied they are collaborating with each other.\n\nIn June 2018, over 400 employees of \"The Washington Post\" signed an open letter to owner Jeff Bezos demanding \"fair wages; fair benefits for retirement, family leave and health care; and a fair amount of job security.\" The open letter was accompanied by video testimonials from employees, who alleged \"shocking pay practices\" despite record growth in subscriptions at the newspaper, with salaries only rising an average of $10 per week, less than half the rate of inflation. The petition followed on a year of unsuccessful negotiations between \"The Washington Post\" Guild and upper management over pay and benefit increases.\n\nIn November 2016, the \"Post\" published a story that relied heavily on a report by PropOrNot, an anonymous internet group that seeks to expose what it calls Russian propaganda. PropOrNot published a list of websites they called \"bona-fide 'useful idiots of the Russian government. Andrew Cockburn, Washington editor for \"Harper's\", was sharply critical of \"Post\"s decision to put the story on its front page, calling the article a \"sorry piece of trash\". Writers in \"The Intercept\", \"Fortune\", and \"Rolling Stone\" also criticized \"Post\" for including a report by an organization with no reputation for fact-checking in an article on \"fake news\". Looking more carefully into their methodology, Adrian Chen, staff writer for \"The New Yorker\", argued that PropOrNot's criteria for establishing propaganda were so broad that they could have included \"not only Russian state-controlled media organizations\", like RT (formerly known as Russia Today), \"but nearly every news outlet in the world, including the \"Post\" itself\" on their list.\n\nIn July 2009, in the midst of intense debate over health care reform, \"The Politico\" reported that a health-care lobbyist had received an \"astonishing\" offer of access to the \"Post's\" \"health-care reporting and editorial staff.\" \"Post\" publisher Katharine Weymouth had planned a series of exclusive dinner parties or \"salons\" at her private residence, to which she had invited prominent lobbyists, trade group members, politicians and business people. Participants were to be charged $25,000 to sponsor a single salon, and $250,000 for 11 sessions, with the events being closed to the public and to the non-\"Post\" press. \"Politico\"s revelation gained a somewhat mixed response in Washington, as it gave the impression that the parties' sole purpose was to allow insiders to purchase face time with \"Post\" staff.\n\nAlmost immediately following the disclosure, Weymouth canceled the salons, saying, \"This should never have happened.\" White House counsel Greg Craig reminded officials that under federal ethics rules, they need advance approval for such events. \"Post\" Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli, who was named on the flier as one of the salon's \"Hosts and Discussion Leaders,\" said he was \"appalled\" by the plan, adding, \"It suggests that access to \"Washington Post\" journalists was available for purchase.\"\n\nOn February 19, 2019, attorneys for Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann announced a defamation lawsuit against the \"Post\", stemming from the January 2019 Lincoln Memorial confrontation between Covington students and the Indigenous Peoples March. In the lawsuit, the \"Post\" is accused of publishing seven \"false and defamatory articles.\" The complaint states:  ... [T]he Post engaged in a modern-day form of McCarthyism by competing with CNN and NBC, among others, to claim leadership of a mainstream and social media mob of bullies which attacked, vilified, and threatened Nicholas Sandmann (\"Nicholas\"), an innocent secondary school child. The Post wrongfully targeted and bullied Nicholas because he was the white, Catholic student wearing a red \"Make America Great Again\" souvenir cap on a school field trip ...\" A federal judge dismissed the case initially, ruling that 30 of the Post's 33 statements that Sandmann's lawyers had described as libelous were not, but in October 2019 allowed an amended complaint to continue.\n\nThe Washington Post was roundly criticized on social media following its editorial department's decision to frame ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as an \"austere religious scholar\" in the obituary the paper had penned. On Twitter users penning tongue-in-cheek overly subdued death notice headlines for long deceased infamous dictators, despots, and serial killers.\n\nDuring a town hall event in August 2019, Vermont senator and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders criticized the Washington Post's perceived negative coverage of his campaign tying it to Jeff Bezos purchase of the newspaper, stating “I talk about that all of the time. And then I wonder why The Washington Post—which is owned by Jeff Bezos who owns Amazon—doesn’t write particularly good articles about me.” In response on CNN, Washington Post executive editor Marty Baron claimed that Sanders' criticism was \"baseless and conspiratorial\". In addition to the Sanders campaign, both the leftist magazine Jacobin and the \nprogressive journalist watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting issued similar criticism of the Washington Post.\n\nMajor stockholders\n\nPublishers\n\nExecutive editors\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "29843", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=29843", "title": "The Goon Show", "text": "The Goon Show\n\nThe Goon Show was a British radio comedy programme, originally produced and broadcast by the BBC Home Service from 1951 to 1960, with occasional repeats on the BBC Light Programme. The first series, broadcast from 28 May to 20 September 1951, was titled Crazy People; subsequent series had the title \"The Goon Show\", a title inspired, according to Spike Milligan, by a Popeye character.\n\nThe show's chief creator and main writer was Spike Milligan. The scripts mixed ludicrous plots with surreal humour, puns, catchphrases and an array of bizarre sound effects. Some of the later episodes feature electronic effects devised by the fledgling BBC Radiophonic Workshop, many of which were reused by other shows for decades. Many elements of the show satirised contemporary life in Britain, parodying aspects of show business, commerce, industry, art, politics, diplomacy, the police, the military, education, class structure, literature and film.\n\nThe show was released internationally through the BBC Transcription Services (TS). It was heard regularly from the 1950s in Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Canada, although these TS versions were frequently edited to avoid controversial subjects. In the United States, NBC began broadcasting the programme on its radio network from the mid-1950s. \n\nSubversive and absurdist, \"The Goon Show\" exercised a considerable influence on the development of British and American comedy and popular culture. It was cited as a major influence by The Beatles, the American comedy team The Firesign Theatre the British comedy troupe Monty Python and others.\n\nThe series was devised and written by Spike Milligan with the regular collaboration of other writers including Larry Stephens, Eric Sykes (who co-wrote most of the episodes in Series 5), Maurice Wiltshire and John Antrobus, initially under the supervision of Jimmy Grafton.\n\nMilligan and Harry Secombe became friends while serving in the Royal Artillery during the Second World War. Famously, Milligan first encountered Secombe after Gunner Milligan's artillery unit accidentally allowed a large howitzer to roll off a cliff, under which Secombe was sitting in a small wireless truck: \"Suddenly there was a terrible noise as some monstrous object fell from the sky quite close to us. There was considerable confusion, and in the middle of it all the flap of the truck was pushed open and a young, helmeted idiot asked 'Anybody see a gun?' It was Milligan.\" Secombe's answer to that question was \"What colour was it?\" Milligan met Peter Sellers after the war at the Hackney Empire, where Secombe was performing, and the three became close friends.\n\nThe group first formed at Jimmy Grafton's London public house called \"Grafton's\" in the late 1940s. Sellers had already débuted with the BBC, Secombe was often heard on \"Variety Bandbox\", Milligan was writing for and acting in the high-profile BBC show \"Hip-Hip-Hoo-Roy\" with Derek Roy, and Michael Bentine, who appeared in the first series, had just begun appearing in Charlie Chester's peak time radio show \"Stand Easy\".\n\nThe four clicked immediately. \"It was always a relief to get away from the theatre and join in the revels at Grafton's on a Sunday night,\" said Secombe years later. They took to calling themselves \"The Goons\" and started recording their pub goings-on with a tape recorder. The BBC producer, Pat Dixon heard a tape and took interest in the group. He pressed the BBC for a long term contract for the gang, knowing that it would secure Sellers for more than just seasonal work, something for which the BBC had been aiming. The BBC acquiesced and ordered an initial series, though without much enthusiasm.\n\nThe series had its premiere in May 1951 and audience figures grew rapidly, from around 370,000 to nearly two million by the end of the 17th show. No recordings of any episode of this series are known to have survived. The BBC commissioned a second series and a number of other changes occurred. The musical interludes were shortened, and Max Geldray joined the lineup. Peter Eton, from the BBC's drama department, replaced Dennis Main Wilson as producer. Eton brought stricter discipline to the show's production. He was also an expert at sound effects and microphone technique, ensuring that the show became a far more dynamic listening experience. However, a few episodes into the series Milligan suffered a major nervous breakdown. He was hospitalised in early December 1952, just before the broadcast of episode five, but it, and the following episode, had already been written, and the next 12 episodes were co-written by Stephens and Grafton. Milligan was absent as a performer for about two months, returning for episode 17, broadcast in early March 1953. As with Series 2, all episodes were co-written by Milligan and Stephens and edited by Jimmy Grafton.\n\nBentine left the show at the end of series 2, citing a desire to pursue solo projects, although there had been an increasing degree of creative tension between him and Milligan.\n\nMilligan blamed his breakdown and the collapse of his first marriage on the sheer volume of writing the show required. His then ground-breaking use of sound effects also contributed to the pressure. All this exacerbated his mental instability that included bipolar disorder, especially during the third series. The BBC however made sure he was surrounded by accomplished radio comedy writers — Sykes, Stephens, Antrobus, Wiltshire, and Grafton — so many of the problems caused by his ill health were skilfully covered over by composite scripts.\n\nMany senior BBC staff were variously bemused and befuddled by the show's surreal humour and it has been reported that senior programme executives erroneously referred to it as \"The Go On Show\" or even \"The Coon Show\".\n\nSeveral of the Goons' nonsense songs were recorded in the late 1950s such as the \"Ying Tong Song\", number 3 in the UK Singles Chart in 1956. The radio show had high audience ratings in Britain at its peak; tickets for the recording sessions at the BBC's Camden Theatre (now known as KOKO) in London were constantly over-subscribed and the various character voices and catchphrases from the show quickly became part of the vernacular. The series has remained consistently popular ever since, with the show being broadcast weekly by Australia's ABC network as late as 2012. The show is also broadcast upon BBC Radio 4 Extra.\n\nThe scripts exist mostly in fan-transcribed versions via dedicated websites. Although three books were published containing selected scripts, they are out of print, and typically available only in libraries or second-hand. Some more recent biographical books contain selected scripts.\n\nThere were 10 series in total, plus an additional series called \"Vintage Goons\", recorded at the same time as the eighth series, which featured recordings of redevelopments (by Milligan) of short sketches from early shows which had not been recorded by transcription services. The first series had 17 episodes plus one special, \"Cinderella\" (1951); the second series had 25 episodes, (1952); the third series had 25 episodes plus one special - \"The Coronation Special\" (1952–53); the fourth series had 30 episodes plus one special, \"Archie In Goonland\" (1953–54); the fifth series had 26 episodes plus one special - \"The Starlings\" (1954–55); the sixth series had 27 episodes plus three specials, (1955–56); the seventh series had 25 episodes plus two specials, (1956–57); the eighth series had 26 episodes, (1957–58); the \"Vintage Goons\" were re-performances of 14 episodes from series four; the ninth series had 17 episodes, (1958–59); and the tenth series had six episodes, (1959–1960).\n\nThroughout its history, each episode of \"The Goon Show, \"which usually ran just under 30 minutes, was essentially structured as a comedy-variety programme, consisting of scripted comedy segments alternating with musical interludes.\n\nThe first two series were mostly produced by Dennis Main Wilson; none of the episodes was given an individual title and these early shows were loosely structured and consisted of four or five unconnected sketches, separated by musical items. According to later producer Peter Eton, the musical segments took up around half the programme. In this formative phase the show co-starred Milligan (who played only minor roles in the early shows), Sellers, Secombe and Michael Bentine as the nominal 'hero' of each episode, madcap inventor Dr Osric Pureheart. Musical performances were by virtuoso jazz harmonica player Max Geldray, singer Ray Ellington and his quartet (both of whom were recruited by Dixon) and vocal group the Stargazers, but they left after Episode 6 of Series 2, and for the remaining episodes Secombe filled in, singing a straight vocal number. Incidental, theme and backing music was provided by Stanley Black and the BBC Dance Orchestra. Series 2 also saw the first appearances of popular characters Minnie Bannister (Milligan) and Henry Crun (Sellers).\n\nFrom Series 3, \"The Goon Show\" (as it was now officially titled) gradually settled into its 'classic' format. Milligan, Stephens and Grafton began to work within a narrative structure and by the second half of Series 4 each episode typically consisted of three acts linked by a continuing plot, with Geldray performing between Acts I and II and Ellington between Acts II and III. Almost all the principal and occasional characters were now performed by Milligan and Sellers, with Secombe usually playing only Neddie Seagoon, who had replaced Pureheart as the hero of most of the stories. The closing theme, backing for Geldray and incidental music was now provided by a big band of freelance musicians under the direction of Wally Stott, who had been writing for the show since the first series. After the end of Series 3, original announcer Andrew Timothy was replaced (at the suggestion of John Snagge) by Wallace Greenslade, who provided spoken narrative links as well as occasionally performing small roles in the scripts.\n\nFrom Series 3 onwards, the principal character roles were:\n\nSecondary characters were the \"Indians\", Banerjee and Lalkaka, the servant Abdul/Singez Thingz, Willium \"Mate\" Cobblers, Cyril, Jim Spriggs, Little Jim, Flowerdew and Chief Ellinga/The Red Bladder - both played by Ray Ellington. There were also occasional guest stars including senior BBC announcer John Snagge, and actors Valentine Dyall, Dick Emery, Kenneth Connor, Dennis Price and Bernard Miles. The traditional plots involved Grytpype-Thynne and Moriarty getting Neddie Seagoon involved in some far-fetched plan, and meeting the other cast members along the way.\n\nMany characters had regular catchphrases which quickly moved into the vernacular; among the best known are:\n\n\"The Goon Show\" has been variously described as \"avant-garde\", \"surrealist\", \"abstract\", and \"four dimensional\". The show played games with the medium of radio itself. Whole scenes were written in which characters would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be inside the room. Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, but it would be another character who had left the room. That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.\n\nThe show paved the way for surreal and alternative humour, as acknowledged by comedians such as Eddie Izzard. The surreality was part of the attraction for Sellers, and this exacerbated his mental instability especially during the third series. \nMany of the sequences have been cited as being visionary in the way that they challenged the traditional conventions of comedy. In the Pythons' autobiography, Terry Jones states \"The Goons of course were my favourite. It was the surreality of the imagery and the speed of the comedy that I loved - the way they broke up the conventions of radio and played with the very nature of the medium.\" This is reiterated by Michael Palin and John Cleese in their contributions to Ventham's (2002) book. Cleese recalls listening to \"The Goon Show\" as a teenager in the mid-1950s \"and being absolutely amazed by its surreal humour. It came at a key stage in my own development and I never missed a show\".\n\nOrchestral introductions, links and accompaniment were provided by a hand-picked big band made up of London-based session musicians. The arrangements and musical direction were done by Wally Stott from the third to the 10th series. Stott produced many arrangements and link passages, further improved by the first-class sound quality the BBC engineers managed to achieve. Members of the band featured prominently in the comedy proceedings, particularly jazz trombonist George Chisholm who frequently played Scots characters. The show's concluding music was usually either \"Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead\" or a truncated and ironic rendition of the \"Alte Kameraden\" (Old Comrades') march, followed by Max Geldray and the Ray Ellington Quartet playing \"Crazy Rhythm\" as play-out music.\n\nIn keeping with the variety requirements of the BBC's \"light entertainment\" format, \"The Goon Show\" scripts were structured in three acts, separated by two musical interludes. These were provided by the Ray Ellington Quartet – who performed a mixture of jazz, rhythm & blues and calypso songs – and by harmonica virtuoso Max Geldray who performed mostly middle of the road numbers and jazz standards of the 30s and 40s accompanied by the big band. Both Ellington and Geldray also made occasional cameo appearances; Ellington was often drafted in to play stereotypical \"black\" roles such as a tribal chieftain, native bearer or Major Bloodnok's nemesis (and counterpoint to Bloodnok's affliction) \"The Red Bladder\".\n\nIt was in its use of pre-recorded and live sound effects that \"The Goon Show\" broke the most new ground. Part of the problem was that \"not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head – he just knew when it had not yet happened\". An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard – which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled \"Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone.\" One after the other, he swung them around his head against the wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking (\"So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!\"). Secombe noted that \"Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each – chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens – all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects.\" An FX instruction in one script read \"Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do\". Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.\n\nMilligan's relationship with BBC managers preparing for the recording of episodes was often acrimonious and resulted in rows, and Milligan later agreed that he was a diva during this time, adding \"I was trying to shake the BBC out of its apathy. Sound effects were a knock on the door and tramps on gravel– that was it, and I tried to transform it.\".\n\nMany of the sound effects created for later programmes featured innovative production techniques borrowed from the realm of \"musique concrète\", and using the then new technology of magnetic tape. Many of these sequences involved the use of complex multiple edits, echo and reverberation and the deliberate slowing down, speeding up or reversing of tapes. One of the most famous was the legendary \"Bloodnok's Stomach\" sound effect, created by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop to represent the sound of Major Bloodnok's digestive system in action, which included a variety of inexplicable gurgling and explosive noises. Lewis (1995, p. 218) states Bloodnok's stomach \"was achieved by overlaying burps, whoops from oscillators, water splashes, cork-like pops, and light artillery blasts\".\n\n\nSeveral of the words and phrases invented for the show soon entered common usage, the most famous being the word lurgi. In the episode \"Lurgi Strikes Britain\", Spike Milligan introduced the fictional malady of Lurgi (sometimes spelled Lurgy), which has survived into modern usage to mean the common cold, or any miscellaneous or non-specific illness (often preceded by the adjective \"dreaded\"). The symptoms of Lurgi included the uncontrollable urge to cry \"Eeeeyack-a-boo\", though even during the episode the ailment proved to be an extortionate attempt to sell brass band musical instruments. Milligan was later to make up his own definition in \"Treasure Island According to Spike Milligan\", where Jim Hawkins' mother describes it as \"like brown spots of shit on the liver\".\n\nAlcohol was strictly forbidden during rehearsals and recording, so the cast fortified themselves with milk. The milk in turn was fortified with brandy. In later episodes the catchphrase \"round the back for the old brandy!\" or \"the old Marlon Brando\" was used to announce the exit of one or more characters, or a break for music. In \"The Pam's Paper Insurance Policy\" (Series 9, Episode 4), Ray Ellington, before his musical item begins, muses, \"I wonder where he keeps that stuff!\". In \"The Scarlet Capsule\" (Series 9, Episode 14), Ellington's reply to Secombe's cry of \"Time for Ray Ellington and the old BRANDYYY there\" was \"The introductions he gives me...\". In \"The Moon Show\" (Series 7, Episode 18), Ellington sympathises with the listeners, stating \"Man, the excuses he makes to get to that brandy!\", causing Milligan, Sellers and Secombe to wail \"MATE!\" in protest. However, Milligan got his own back by making Ellington laugh halfway through the song by doing Minnie Bannister voices while Ellington was singing.\n\nDuring radio programmes of the 1920s and 1930s, the background noise for crowd scenes was often achieved by a moderately large group of people mumbling \"rhubarb\" under their breath with random inflections. This was often parodied by Milligan, who would try to get the same effect with only three or four people, clearly intoning the word rather than mumbling. After some time, Secombe began throwing in \"custard\" during these scenes (for example, in \"The Fear of Wages and Wings Over Dagenham\", where the phrase was amended to 'flying rhubarb').\n\nAs well as being used as a comic device randomly inserted into different sketches to avoid silence, the blowing of raspberries entered the Goons as Harry Secombe's signal to the other actors that he was going to crack up; you would hear a joke from him, a raspberry, and a stream of laughter. In the Goons' musical recording \"The Ying-Tong Song\", Milligan performed a solo for raspberry-blower, as one might for tuba or baritone saxophone. Milligan made much use of a rather surreal Columbia 78RPM sound effects disc, catalogue number YB20, which bears the innocuous title \"Donkey\" on the label. Approximating possibly the most obscene and flatulent noise ever recorded, it appeared first in the show \"The Sinking of Westminster Pier\" as a sound to accompany an oyster opening its shell; it thereafter became known as Fred the Oyster, and appears as such in the scripts. This recording was often used as a reaction to a bad joke. Examples include \"The Last Goon Show of All\" during which Neddie shouts old jokes into a fuel tank in order to \"start the show\".\n\nYears later, Milligan collaborated with Ronnie Barker on \"The Phantom Raspberry Blower of Old London Town\" in which the credits read, \"Raspberries professionally blown by Spike Milligan\". David Jason has also claimed to have produced the sound effect and indeed was credited with this in the second segment of Ronnie Barker's LWT series \"Six Dates with Barker\" (1971).\n\nIn several shows, one character, typically either Henry Crun or Minnie Bannister, would be found trapped in a piano. In \"The Mystery of the Fake Neddie Seagoon\", Crun was inside a piano and his speech was accompanied by suitable piano noises. In \"The Jet-Propelled Guided NAAFI\", Moriarty is hiding in a piano disguised as one of the strings. Gritpype-Thynne plays a \"do-re-mi\" scale to find him - Moriarty is \"me\".\n\nThe \"in a piano\" joke was re-used one last time in \"The Last Goon Show of All\".\n\nSometimes characters were introduced as \"scion of the house of Rowton\", or \"member of Rowton House\". This was a reference to the \"Rowton Houses\", which were hostels for working men in London.\n\nThe following films were a product of Goon activity:\n\nSpike Milligan teamed up with illustrator Pete Clarke to produce two books of comic strip Goons. The stories were slightly modified versions of classic Goon shows.\n\"The Last Goon Show of All\", \"The Affair of the Lone Banana\", \"The Scarlet Capsule\", \"The Pevensey Bay Disaster\"\n\"The Case of the Vanishing Room\", \"The Case of the Missing C.D. Plates\", \"The Saga of the Internal Mountain\", \"Rommel's Treasure\"\n\"Foreword by Sellers\", Details of the Show, Cast, Characters, etc, and \"The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler\", \"The Phantom Head Shaver\", \"The Affair of the Lone Banana\", \"The Canal\", \"Napoleon's Piano\", \"Foiled by President Fred\", \"The Mighty Wurlitzer\", \"The Hastings Flyer\", \"The House of Teeth\".\n\"The Battle of Spion Kop\", \"Ned's Atomic Dustbin\", \"The spy; or, Who is Pink Oboe?\", \"Call of the West\", \"The Scarlet Capsule\", \"The Tay Bridge Disaster\", \"The Gold-plate Robbery\", \"The £50 cure\".\n\nA recreation of a \"Goon Show\" broadcast before a studio audience is seen early in the HBO Original Movie, \"The Life and Death of Peter Sellers\" (2004), with Geoffrey Rush as Sellers, Edward Tudor-Pole as Spike Milligan, Steve Pemberton as Harry Secombe and Lance Ellington as Ray Ellington. A brief moment from that recreation is seen in the trailer for that film.\n\n\"Ying Tong\" is a play written by Roy Smiles which is set partly in a radio studio, partly in a mental asylum and partly in Spike Milligan's mind. It recreates the Goons recording the show, but part way through Spike has a mental breakdown and is committed to an asylum. While it features all of the Goons throughout (although Bentine is mentioned, the fourth character represents Wallace Greenslade), the focus is on Milligan and his breakdown.\nTouring in late 2018 in the UK, Apollo Theatre Company in conjunction with Spike Milligan Productions recreated three episodes of The Goon Show - The Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler, Tails of Men's Shirts, and The Phantom Head Shaver - with faithful recreations of the original scripts. Co-producer Norma Farnes, Milligan’s ex-manager, agreed to the use of the material on the basis the production was respectful of the scripts. The roles of Sellers, Milligan, and Secombe were played by Julian McDowell, Colin Elmer and Clive Greenwood and the production was directed by McDowell and Tim Astley.\n\n\"The Idiot Weekly, Price 2d\", which starred Peter Sellers, was the first attempt to translate \"Goon Show\" humour to television. Made for Associated-Rediffusion during 1956 and only broadcast in the London area, it was mainly written by Milligan, with contributions from other writers in the Associated London Scripts cooperative including Dave Freeman and Terry Nation, with Eric Sykes as script editor. \"The Idiot Weekly\" (1958–1962) was an Australian radio comedy series written by and starring Milligan with an Australian supporting cast including Ray Barrett and John Bluthal. It was made for the ABC during Milligan's numerous visits to Australia, where his family had emigrated. Milligan adapted some \"Goon Show\" scripts and included his \"Goon Show\" characters (notably Eccles) in many episodes. Six episodes of \"The Idiot Weekly\" were remade by the BBC as \"The Omar Khayyam Show\" in 1963.\n\n\"The Telegoons\" (1963–1964) was a 15-minute BBC puppet show featuring the voices of Milligan, Secombe and Sellers and adapted from the radio scripts. 26 episodes were made. The series was briefly repeated immediately after its original run, and all episodes are known to survive, having been unofficially released online.\n\nRecorded for Harry Secombe's six-part comedy series, of which only a portion was actually used for the original broadcast, this was similar to \"Tales of Men's Shirts\" as a re-enactment of a radio play for television. Whilst initially it was thought that only the portion used in the TV show survived, a full copy of the performance was found by the British Film Institute.\n\nEssentially a re-enactment of a radio performance, the three Goons were joined by John Cleese as announcer for a special shown on Thames Television. While the original video tape was wiped, an almost-complete copy of this broadcast is held by the British Film Institute.\n\nIn 1972, the Goons reunited to perform \"The Last Goon Show of All\"\n\nIn 2001, the BBC recorded a \"new\" \"Goon Show\", \"Goon Again\", featuring Andy Secombe (son of Harry), Jon Glover and Jeffrey Holland, with Christopher Timothy (son of Andrew Timothy) announcing and Lance Ellington (son of Ray Ellington) singing, based on two lost series 3 episodes from 1953, \"The Story of Civilisation\" and \"The Plymouth Ho Armada\", both written by Milligan and Stephens.\n\nThe Goons made a number of records including \"I'm Walking Backwards for Christmas\" (originally sung by Milligan in the show to fill in during a musicians' strike), and \"Bloodnok's Rock and Roll Call\", the B-side of which, the \"Ying Tong Song\", soon became more popular and was reissued as an A-side in the mid-1970s, becoming a surprise novelty hit. The last time all three Goons worked together was in 1978 when they recorded two new songs, \"The Raspberry Song\" and \"Rhymes\".\n\nA 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers as well as Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller. A spoof of the film \"The Bridge on the River Kwai\", it was originally recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer George Martin removed the \"K\" every time the word \"Kwai\" was uttered, creating \"Bridge on the River Wye\". The LP is based on \"The Goon Show\"s \"African Incident\" (30 December 1957), which featured Sellers' vocal impersonation of Alec Guinness. Lewis' (1995, pp. 205–206) gives a good account of this background.\n\nIn 1964, Milligan, Secombe and Sellers lent their voices to a comedy LP, \"How to Win an Election (or Not Lose by Much)\", which was written by Leslie Bricusse. It was not exactly a Goons reunion because Sellers was in Hollywood and had to record his lines separately. The album was reissued on CD in 1997.\n\nIn George Perry's book \"The Life of Python\" (1999) he comments: \"In the Britain of 1950, humour was derived from three main sources: print, film and radio, and despite the advent of television, throughout the 1950s radio remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy. In this period, two radio comedy shows exercised a profound influence. The first was \"Take It From Here\", with its polished professionalism. The other was \"The Goon Show\", with its absurdity, manic surreality and unpredictability.\"\n\nOn the influence of The Goons, Eric Sykes wrote that in the post-World War II years, \"other shows came along but 'The House of Comedy' needed electricity. Then, out of the blue ... \"The Goons\" ...Spike Milligan simply blew the roof off, and lit the whole place with sunshine. At a cursory glance, \"The Goon Show\" was merely quick-fire delivery of extremely funny lines mouthed by eccentric characters, but this was only the froth. In \"The Goon Show\", Spike was unknowingly portraying every facet of the British psyche\".\n\nSykes and Milligan, along with Ray Galton, Alan Simpson, Frankie Howerd and Stanley (\"Scruffy\") Dale, co-founded the writers' cooperative Associated London Scripts (ALS), which over time included others including Larry Stephens. In his book Spike & Co (2006, pp. 344–345), Graham McCann says \"the anarchic spirit of the Goon Show...would inspire, directly or indirectly and to varying extents, \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\", \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\", \" The Young Ones\", \"Vic Reeves Big Night Out\", \"The League of Gentlemen\", \"Brass Eye\" and countless other strange and bold new comedies\". Other ALS-related comedies such as \"Sykes and A...\", \"Hancock's Half Hour\", \"Steptoe and Son\", \"Beyond Our Ken\", and \"Round The Horne\" influenced their own genres of comedy.\n\nEddie Izzard notes that the Goons and Milligan in particular \"influenced a new generation of comedians who came to be known as 'alternative'.\" In Ventham's (2002, p. 151) compilation, John Cleese notes that \"In comedy, there are a very small number of defining moments when somebody comes along and genuinely creates a breakthrough, takes us into territory where nobody has been before. The only experiences to which I can compare my own discovery of the Goons are going to see N. F. Simpson's play \"One Way Pendulum\" ... or, later on, hearing Peter Cook for the first time. They were just light years ahead of everyone else.\"\n\nThe Goons made a considerable impact on the humour of The Beatles, and especially on John Lennon. On 30 September 1973, Lennon reviewed the book \"The Goon Show Scripts\" for \"The New York Times\". He wrote: \"I was 12 when \"The Goon Show\" first hit me, 16 when they finished with me. Their humour was the only proof that the world was insane. One of my earlier efforts at writing was a 'newspaper' called \"The Daily Howl\". I would write it at night, then take it into school and read it aloud to my friends. Looking at it now, it seems strangely similar to \"The Goon Show\".\" Lennon also noted that George Martin, the Beatles' long-time producer, had previously made records with both Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers.\n\nIn a discussion of an accidentally Goonish nature, about introducing the next song during the 1963 BBC production of \"Pop Go The Beatles\", Lennon is also recorded as quipping \"Love these Goon shows\". This was included in the double album and CD entitled \" Live at the BBC\" (side 4, track 10 of the LP; track 62 of CD).\n\nAmong the influences on Monty Python, the members of the comedy team are described as being \"indebted to BBC radio comedy, and particularly to the \"Goon Show\".\" The future members of Monty Python were fans, and on many occasions they expressed their collective debt to Milligan and The Goons. Scudamore (1985, p. 170) cites an interview for example, in which John Cleese stated \"\"the Goon Show\" influenced us enormously\". He reiterates this point in his contribution to Ventham's (2002, p. 151) book: \"We all loved \"The Goon Show\" in the Monty Python Team: it ignited some energy in us. It was more a spirit that was passed on, rather than any particular technique. The point is that once somebody has crossed a barrier and done something that has never been done before, it is terribly easy for everybody else to cross it\".\n\nSimilarly, in the introduction to Graham Chapman's posthumous anthology (2006, p. xvii) Yoakum notes that while other radio comedies influenced Chapman, \"the show that truly astounded Graham, and was a major influence on his comedy was \"The Goon Show\".\" And on page 23 Chapman states: \"from about the age of seven or eight I used to be an avid listener to a radio programme called \"The Goon Show\". In fact, at that stage I wanted to \"be\" a Goon\".\n\nIn their episode Election Night Special, the Pythons gave an appreciative nod to their forebears. When one of the onscreen elections reporters asks his companion, \"What do you make of the nylon dog cardigan and plastic mule rest?\" a voice offstage yells, \"There's no such thing!\" to which the reporter replies, \"Thank you, Spike.\"\n\nPeter Sellers died on 24 July 1980, aged 54. Michael Bentine died on 26 November 1996, aged 74. Harry Secombe died on 11 April 2001, aged 79. Milligan claimed to be relieved that Secombe had died before him, because had he died before Secombe then Secombe would have been in a position to sing at his funeral. Terence \"Spike\" Milligan died on 27 February 2002, aged 83; Secombe ended up singing at his funeral anyway, as a recording. Two years later Milligan's wish to have the words \"I told you I was ill\" inscribed on his gravestone was finally granted, although the church would only agree if the words were written in Irish, as \"Dúirt mé leat go raibh mé breoite\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "60589", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=60589", "title": "Grand Ole Opry", "text": "Grand Ole Opry\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry is a weekly American country music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \"barn dance\" on WSM. Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history. Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, and gospel music as well as comedic performances and skits. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and internet listeners.\n\nThe Opry<nowiki>'</nowiki>s current primary slogan is \"The Show That Made Country Music Famous.\" Other slogans include \"Home of American Music\" and \"Country's Most Famous Stage\" and most importantly \"The Mother Church of Country Music.\" \n\nIn the 1930s, the show began hiring professionals and expanded to four hours. Broadcasting by then at 50,000 watts, WSM made the program a Saturday night musical tradition in nearly 30 states. In 1939, it debuted nationally on NBC Radio. The Opry moved to a permanent home, the Ryman Auditorium, in 1943. As it developed in importance, so did the city of Nashville, which became America's \"country music capital.\" The \"Grand Ole Opry\" holds such significance in Nashville that is included as a \"home of\" mention on the welcome signs seen by motorists at the Metro Nashville/Davidson County line.\n\nMembership in the Opry remains one of country music's crowning achievements. Since 1974, the show has been broadcast from the Grand Ole Opry House east of downtown Nashville, with an annual three-month winter foray back to the Ryman since 1999. In addition to the radio programs, performances have been sporadically televised over the years.\n\nThe \"Grand Ole Opry\" started as the \"WSM Barn Dance\" in the new fifth-floor radio studio of the National Life & Accident Insurance Company in downtown Nashville on November 28, 1925. On October 17, 1925, management began a program featuring \"Dr. Humphrey Bate and his string quartet of old-time musicians.\" On November 2, WSM hired long-time announcer and program director George D. Hay, an enterprising pioneer from the \"National Barn Dance\" program at WLS in Chicago, who was also named the most popular radio announcer in America as a result of his radio work with both WLS and WMC in Memphis, Tennessee. Hay launched the \"WSM Barn Dance\" with 77-year-old fiddler Uncle Jimmy Thompson on November 28, 1925, and that date is celebrated as the birth date of the \"Grand Ole Opry\".\n\nSome of the bands regularly on the show during its early days included Bill Monroe, the Possum Hunters (with Humphrey Bate), the Fruit Jar Drinkers with Uncle Dave Macon, the Crook Brothers, the Binkley Brothers' Dixie Clodhoppers, Sid Harkreader, DeFord Bailey, Fiddlin' Arthur Smith, and the Gully Jumpers.\n\nJudge Hay liked the Fruit Jar Drinkers and asked them to appear last on each show because he wanted to always close each segment with \"red hot fiddle playing.\" They were the second band accepted on \"Barn Dance\", with the Crook Brothers being the first. When the Opry began having square dancers on the show, the Fruit Jar Drinkers always played for them. In 1926, Uncle Dave Macon, a Tennessee banjo player who had recorded several songs and toured on the vaudeville circuit became its first real star.\n\nThe phrase \"Grand Ole Opry\" was first uttered on radio on December 10, 1927. At the time, the NBC Red Network's \"Music Appreciation Hour\", a program with classical music and selections from grand opera, was followed by \"Barn Dance\". Opry presenter George Hay introduced the programme:\nFor the past hour, we have been listening to music taken largely from Grand Opera. From now on, we will present the \"Grand Ole Opry.\"\nAs audiences for the live show increased, National Life & Accident Insurance's radio venue became too small to accommodate the hordes of fans. They built a larger studio, but it was still not large enough. After several months with no audiences, National Life decided to allow the show to move outside its home offices. In October 1934, the Opry moved into then-suburban Hillsboro Theatre (now the Belcourt) before moving to the Dixie Tabernacle in East Nashville on June 13, 1936. The Opry then moved to the War Memorial Auditorium, a downtown venue adjacent to the State Capitol, and a 25-cent admission fee was charged to try to curb the large crowds, but to no avail. On June 5, 1943, the Opry moved to Ryman Auditorium.\n\nTop-charting country music acts performed at the Opry during the Ryman years, including Roy Acuff – called the King of Country Music – Hank Williams, Webb Pierce, Faron Young, Martha Carson, Lefty Frizzell, and many others.\n\nOne hour of the Opry was nationally broadcast by the NBC Red Network from 1939 to 1956, and for much of its run, it aired one hour after the program that had inspired it, \"National Barn Dance\". The NBC segment, originally known by the name of its sponsor, \"The Prince Albert Show\", was first hosted by Acuff, who was succeeded by Red Foley from 1946 to 1954. From October 15, 1955 to September 1956, ABC-TV aired a live, hour-long television version once a month on Saturday nights (sponsored by Ralston-Purina) that pre-empted one hour of the then-90-minute \"Ozark Jubilee\". From 1955 to 1957, Al Gannaway owned and produced both \"The Country Show\" and \"Stars of the Grand Ole Opry,\" both filmed programs syndicated by Flamingo Films. Gannaway's \"Stars of the Grand Ole Opry\" was the first television show shot in color.\n\nOn October 2, 1954, a teenage Elvis Presley had his only Opry performance. Although the audience reacted politely to his revolutionary brand of rockabilly music, Opry manager Jim Denny told Presley's producer Sam Phillips after the show that the singer's style did not suit the program.\n\nIn the 1960s, as the hippie counterculture movement spread, the Opry maintained a strait-laced, conservative image with \"longhairs\" not being featured on the show. The Byrds were a notable exception. Country rock pioneer Gram Parsons, who was a member of The Byrds at the time, was in Nashville to work on the band's country rock album, \"Sweetheart of the Rodeo\". The band's record label, Columbia Records, had arranged for The Byrds to perform at the Ryman on March 15, 1968, a prospect that thrilled Parsons. However, when the band took the stage the audience's response was immediately hostile, resulting in derisive heckling, booing, and mocking calls of \"tweet, tweet\" and \"cut your hair\" The Byrds further outraged the Opry establishment by ignoring accepted protocol when they performed Parsons' song \"Hickory Wind\" instead of the Merle Haggard song \"Life in Prison,\" as had been announced by Tompall Glaser. Two decades later, long after Parsons's death, members of The Byrds reconciled with the Opry and collaborated on the 1989 album \"\".\n\nAnother artist that ran afoul of the Oprys stringent standards was Jerry Lee Lewis, who made his first and (to date) only appearance on the show on January 20, 1973, after several years of success on the country charts. Lewis was given two conditions for his appearance – no rock and roll and no profanity – and he proceeded to disregard both, even referring to himself as a certain unairable maternal insult at one point. In a continuous 40-minute set, Lewis played a mixture of his rock and roll hits and covers of other singers' country songs. It has been said that he was bitter about how he was treated when he first arrived in Nashville in 1955, and he supposedly used his Opry appearance to exact revenge on the Nashville music industry.\n\nRyman Auditorium was home to the Opry until 1974. By the late 1960s, National Life & Accident desired a new, larger, more modern home for the long-running radio show. Already 51 years old at the time the Opry moved there, the Ryman was beginning to suffer from disrepair as the downtown neighborhood around it fell victim to increasing urban decay. Despite these shortcomings, the show's popularity continued to increase, and its weekly crowds were outgrowing the 3,000-seat venue. The Opry's operators wanted to build a new air-conditioned theater, with greater seating capacity, ample parking, and the ability to serve as a television production facility. The ideal location would be in a less urbanized part of town to provide visitors with a safer, more controlled, and more enjoyable experience.\n\nNational Life & Accident purchased farmland owned by a local sausage manufacturer (Rudy's Farm) in the Pennington Bend area of Nashville, nine miles east of downtown and adjacent to the newly constructed Briley Parkway. The new Opry venue was the centerpiece of a grand entertainment complex at that location, which later included Opryland USA Theme Park and Opryland Hotel. The theme park opened to the public on June 30, 1972, well ahead of the 4,000-seat Opry House, which debuted nearly two years later, on Saturday, March 16, 1974.\n\nOpening night was attended by sitting U.S. President Richard Nixon, who played a few songs on the piano. To carry on the tradition of the show's run at the Ryman, a six-foot circle of oak was cut from the corner of the Ryman's stage and inlaid into center stage at the new venue. Artists on stage usually stood on the circle as they performed, and most modern performers still follow this tradition.\n\nThe theme park was closed and demolished following the 1997 season, but the Grand Ole Opry House remains in use. The immediate area around it was left intact, even throughout the construction of Opry Mills, which opened in May 2000. The outside is decorated with the commemorative plaques of country music Grammy winners, formerly of Opryland's StarWalk.\n\nThe \"Grand Ole Opry\" continues to be performed every Tuesday, Friday, Saturday, and occasionally Wednesday at the Grand Ole Opry House from February through October each year, and the site was added to the National Register of Historic Places on January 27, 2015.\n\nThe Grand Ole Opry House was also the home of the Country Music Association Awards from 1974 to 2004, and hosted three weeks of tapings for the long-running game show \"Wheel of Fortune\" in 2003. The venue has also been the site of the GMA Dove Awards on multiple occasions.\n\nOn December 21, 2018, the backstage band room was officially named the Jimmy Capps Music Room in honor of Capps's 60th anniversary on the \"Opry\".\n\nFollowing the departure of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for 20 years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to tear down the Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including many influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building remained a tourist attraction with tours.\n\nIn 1991 and 1992, Emmylou Harris performed a series of concerts there and released some of the recordings as an album entitled \"At the Ryman\". The concert and album's high acclaim renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue. Beginning in September 1993, Gaylord Entertainment initiated a full renovation of the Ryman, restoring it to a world-class concert hall that reopened with a broadcast of \"A Prairie Home Companion\" on June 4, 1994.\n\nOn Sunday, October 18, 1998, the Opry held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974. The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, and the decision was made to host the Oprys regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999, as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue.\n\nBeginning in November 1999, the Opry was held at Ryman Auditorium for three months, partly due to the ongoing construction of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since then, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism. While still officially the \"Grand Ole Opry\", the shows there are billed as \"Opry at the Ryman\". From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the \"Radio City Christmas Spectacular\" took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while the \"Opry\" was away. It was replaced by \"Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas! The Musical\" from 2015 in 2017 and by Cirque Dreams Holidaze in 2018. Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer The Musical is scheduled to perform between November 16 and December 27, 2019.\n\nIn May 2010, the Opry House was flooded, along with much of Nashville, when the Cumberland River overflowed its banks. Repairs were made, and the Opry itself remained uninterrupted. Over the course of the summer of 2010, the broadcast temporarily originated from alternate venues in Nashville, with Ryman Auditorium hosting the majority of the shows. Other venues included TPAC War Memorial Auditorium, another former Opry home; TPAC's Andrew Jackson Hall; Nashville Municipal Auditorium; Allen Arena at Lipscomb University; and Two Rivers Baptist Church.\n\nMuch of the auditorium's main floor seating, the backstage areas, and the entire stage – including the inlaid circle of wood from Ryman's stage – was underwater during the flood. While the Grand Ole Opry House's stage was replaced, the Ryman circle was restored and again placed at center stage in the Grand Ole Opry House before shows resumed. The renovations following the flood also resulted in an updated and much-expanded backstage area, including the construction of more dressing rooms and a performer's lounge.\n\nThe Opry returned to the Grand Ole Opry House on September 28, 2010, in a special edition of the Opry entitled \"Country Comes Home\" that was televised live on Great American Country. The evening was filled with one-of-a-kind Opry moments. Martina McBride and Connie Smith sang Smith's signature hit \"Once a Day\" together, and other collaborations included Dierks Bentley and Del McCoury (\"Roll On Buddy, Roll On\"), Josh Turner and Lorrie Morgan (\"Golden Ring\"), and Montgomery Gentry and Charlie Daniels Band (\"Devil Went Down To Georgia\"), among others. The show closed with an all-star guitar jam featuring Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, Steve Wariner, Ricky Skaggs, and Marty Stuart.\n\nThe \"Grand Ole Opry\" is broadcast live on WSM-AM at 7 p.m. CT on Saturday nights, changed from a previous time start of 6:30. A similar program, \"Friday Night Opry\", airs live on Friday nights. From February through December, \"Tuesday Night Opry\" is also aired live. Wednesday shows are typically presented in the summer months, while an \"Opry Country Classics\" program sporadically airs on Thursdays, devoted solely to older artists and broadcasting from Ryman Auditorium. The length of each of the various shows varies; typically, the show runs three nights a week for just over two hours each night, with Saturday night shows often extended as late as midnight.\n\nThe Opry provides a fourteen-piece house band for performers should they not have a band of their own.\n\nThe Opry can also be heard live on \"Willie's Roadhouse\" on channel 59 on Sirius XM Satellite Radio, and the program streams on WSM's website. ABC broadcast the \"Grand Ole Opry\" as a monthly series from 1955 to 1956, and PBS televised annual live performances from 1978 to 1981. In 1985, The Nashville Network began airing an edited half-hour version of the program as \"Grand Ole Opry Live.\" The show moved to Country Music Television, where it expanded to an hour, and then to the Great American Country (GAC) cable network, which no longer televised its \"Opry Live\" show after both networks channel drifted towards generic Southern lifestyle programming. Circle, a new over-the-air digital subchannel network operated by Gray Television and Ryman Hospitality Properties, resumed telecasting the \"Opry\" as its flagship program when it launched in 2020. RFD-TV carries reruns of Opry telecasts under the title \"Opry Encore\".\n\nRegular performers at the Grand Ole Opry can be inducted into the organization as a member; the Opry management, when it decides to induct a new member, directs an existing member to publicly ask them to join, usually during a live episode. As the Opry is a running series, membership in the show's cast must be maintained throughout an artist's career, through frequent performances, and expires when the performer dies (in the case of duos, membership continues until both members die, with the survivor allowed to maintain membership after the other's death; more recent protocol has allowed performers who are incapacitated or retired to maintain Opry membership until they die, with five such members holding that status as of 2019—Tom T. Hall, Hal Ketchum, Barbara Mandrell, Jeanne Pruett, and Randy Travis, though Travis still makes limited appearances). The Opry maintains a wall of fame listing every member of the Opry in the show's history, including those that have died, lost or relinquished their membership. Receiving Opry membership is considered an honor that is similar in prestige to a hall of fame induction, with the caveat that a number of prominent country musicians never received it. The most recent induction took place on June 11, 2019, when Luke Combs became the 211th member of the Opry; as of that date, there are 68 standing members of the Grand Ole Opry.\n\nThe Opry also maintains a list of active \"guest musicians\" without official Opry membership (over 400 as of May 2019) who appear on the show, spanning the genres of country, roots rock, stand-up comedy and contemporary Christian music.\n\nIn April 1963, Opry management made a rule that members had to perform on at least 26 shows a year to keep their memberships active. WSM dropped the number of required performances to 20 in January 1964, and the minimum number was 12 in 2000. Although the minimum number of performances has been reduced over the years, artists offered membership are expected to show their dedication to the Opry with frequent attendance.\n\nAnother controversy raged for years over allowable instrumentation, especially the use of drums and electrically amplified instruments. Some purists were appalled at the prospect; traditionally a string bass provided the rhythm component in country music, and percussion instruments were seldom used. Electric amplification, new in the beginning days of the Opry, was regarded as the province of popular music and jazz in the 1940s. Although the Opry allowed electric guitars and steel guitars by World War II, the restrictions against drums and horns continued, causing a conflict when Bob Wills and Pee Wee King defied the show's ban on drums.\n\nStonewall Jackson, the Opry's longest-tenured standing member as of 2019, sued the Opry management in 2007 alleging that manager Pete Fisher was trying to purge older members of the Opry from its membership and committing age discrimination. Jackson settled the lawsuit in 2008.\n\nThe company has enforced its trademark on the name \"Grand Ole Opry,\" with trademark registrations in the United States and in numerous countries around the world. It has taken court action to limit use of the word \"Opry\" – not directly trademarked – to members of the Opry and products associated with or licensed by it and to discourage use of the word in ways that would imply a connection to the Grand Ole Opry. In late 1968, for instance, WSM sued Opry Records, a record label that was independent of WSM, and the court decided that \"the record is replete with newspaper and magazine articles and clippings which demonstrate conclusively that the term 'Opry,' standing alone as defendant has used it, is constantly used in country and western music circles in referring to plaintiff's 'Grand Ole Opry'.\" The court also stated \"the defendant has appropriated, at its peril, the dominant or salient term in the plaintiff's mark, a term which identified the 'Grand Ole Opry' in the mind of the public many years before the inception of 'Opry Records' – the name adopted by defendant.\"\n\nIn another case, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted summary judgment that the term \"Opry\" is a generic term (and thus no more protected than the words \"Grand\" or \"Ole\"), but the Federal Circuit court reversed this decision. As recently as 2009, the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board granted judgment against Texas Opry House, LLC, which had filed a trademark application for TEXAS OPRY HOUSE.\n\nIn 2004, it was announced that the \"Grand Ole Opry\" had contracted for the first time with a \"presenting sponsor,\" Cracker Barrel, and the sponsoring company's name would be associated with \"Grand Ole Opry\" in all its advertising. Humana, Inc., Cracker Barrel, and Dollar General are the present sponsors of the Opry.\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "113352", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113352", "title": "The Shadow", "text": "The Shadow\n\nThe Shadow is the name of a collection of serialized dramas, originally in 1930s pulp novels, and then in a wide variety of media. Its title character has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in American comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five feature films. The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles.\n\nOriginally a mysterious radio-show narrator, The Shadow was developed into a distinctive literary character in 1931 by writer Walter B. Gibson.\n\nThe Shadow debuted on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the radio program \"Detective Story Hour,\" which was developed to boost sales of Street & Smith's monthly pulp \"Detective Story Magazine.\" When listeners of the program began asking at newsstands for copies of \"That Shadow detective magazine,\" Street & Smith decided to create a magazine based on The Shadow and hired Gibson to create a character concept to fit the name and voice and write a story featuring him. The first issue of \"The Shadow Magazine\" went on sale on April 1, 1931, a pulp series.\n\nOn September 26, 1937, \"The Shadow\" radio drama, a new radio series based on the character as created by Gibson for the pulp magazine, premiered with the story \"The Death House Rescue,\" in which The Shadow was characterized as having \"the power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him.\" In the magazine stories, The Shadow was not given the literal ability to become invisible.\n\nThe introduction from \"The Shadow\" radio program \"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows!,\" spoken by actor Frank Readick, has earned a place in the American idiom. These words were accompanied by an ominous laugh and a musical theme, Camille Saint-Saëns' \"Le Rouet d'Omphale\" (\"Omphale's Spinning Wheel,\" composed in 1872). At the end of each episode, The Shadow reminded listeners that \"The weed of crime bears bitter fruit! Crime does not pay. The Shadow knows!\" (Some early episodes, however, used the alternate statement, \"As you sow evil, so shall you reap evil! Crime does not pay... The Shadow knows!\")\n\nIn order to boost the sales of its \"Detective Story Magazine,\" Street & Smith Publications hired David Chrisman, of the Ruthrauff & Ryan advertising agency, and writer-director William Sweets to adapt the magazine's stories into a radio series. Chrisman and Sweets thought the upcoming series should be narrated by a mysterious storyteller with a sinister voice, and began searching for a suitable name. One of their scriptwriters, Harry Engman Charlot, suggested various possibilities, such as \"The Inspector\" or \"The Sleuth.\" Charlot then proposed the ideal name for the phantom announcer: \"The Shadow.\"\n\nThus, beginning on July 31, 1930, \"The Shadow\" was the name given to the mysterious narrator of the \"Detective Story Hour\". The narrator was initially voiced by James LaCurto, who was replaced after four months by prolific character actor Frank Readick Jr. The episodes were drawn from the \"Detective Story Magazine\" issued by Street & Smith, \"the nation's oldest and largest publisher of pulp magazines.\" Although the latter company had hoped the radio broadcasts would boost the declining sales of \"Detective Story Magazine\", the result was quite different. Listeners found the sinister announcer much more compelling than the unrelated stories. They soon began asking newsdealers for copies of \"that \"Shadow\" detective magazine,\" even though it did not exist.\n\nRecognizing the demand and responding promptly, circulation manager Henry William Ralston of Street & Smith commissioned Walter B. Gibson to begin writing stories about \"The Shadow.\" Using the pen name of Maxwell Grant and claiming the stories were \"from The Shadow's private annals as told to\" him, Gibson wrote 282 out of 325 tales over the next 20 years: a novel-length story twice a month (1st and 15th). The first story produced was \"The Living Shadow,\" published April 1, 1931.\n\nGibson's characterization of The Shadow laid the foundations for the archetype of the superhero, including stylized imagery and title, sidekicks, supervillains, and a secret identity. Clad in black, The Shadow operated mainly after dark as a vigilante in the name of justice, terrifying criminals into vulnerability. Gibson himself claimed the literary inspirations upon which he had drawn were Bram Stoker's \"Dracula\" and Edward Bulwer-Lytton's \"The House and the Brain.\" Another possible inspiration for The Shadow is the French character Judex; the first episode of the original \"Judex\" film serial was released in the United States as \"The Mysterious Shadow\", and Judex's costume is rather similar to The Shadow's. French comics historian Xavier Fournier notes other similarities with another silent serial, \"The Shielding Shadow\", whose protagonist had a power of invisibility, and considers The Shadow to be a mix between the two characters. In the 1940s, some \"Shadow\" comic strips were translated in France as adventures of Judex.\n\nBecause of the great effort involved in writing two full-length novels every month, several guest writers were hired to write occasional installments in order to lighten Gibson's workload. Those guest writers included Lester Dent, who also wrote the Doc Savage stories, and Theodore Tinsley. In the late 1940s, mystery novelist Bruce Elliott (also a magician) temporarily replaced Gibson as the primary author of the pulp series. Richard Wormser, a reader for Street & Smith, wrote two Shadow stories.\n\n\"The Shadow Magazine\" ceased publication with the Summer 1949 issue, but Walter B. Gibson wrote three new \"official\" stories between 1963 and 1980. The first began a new series of nine updated Shadow novels from Belmont Books, starting with \"Return of The Shadow\" under his own name. The remaining eight—\"The Shadow Strikes\", \"Beware Shadow\", \"Cry Shadow\", \"The Shadow's Revenge\", \"Mark of The Shadow\", \"Shadow Go Mad\", \"Night of The Shadow\", and \"The Shadow, Destination: Moon\"—were written by Dennis Lynds, not Gibson, under the Maxwell Grant pseudonym. In these novels, The Shadow is given psychic powers, including the radio character's ability \"to cloud men's minds,\" so that he effectively became invisible; he is more of a spymaster than crime fighter in these eight updated novels.\n\nThe Shadow returned in 2015 in the authorized novel \"The Sinister Shadow\", an entry in the \"Wild Adventures of Doc Savage\" series from Altus Press. The novel, written by Will Murray, used unpublished material originally written in 1932 by Doc Savage originator Lester Dent and published under the pen name Kenneth Robeson. Set in 1933, the story details the conflict between the two pulp magazine icons during a crime wave caused by a murderous kidnapping-extortion ring led by the mysterious criminal mastermind known as the Funeral Director.\n\nA sequel, \"Empire of Doom\", was published in 2016 and takes place seven years later in 1940. The Shadow's old enemy, Shiwan Khan, attacks his hated adversary. Doc Savage joins forces with The Shadow to vanquish Khan in a Doc Savage novel written by Will Murray, from a concept by Lester Dent.\n\nThe character and look of The Shadow gradually evolved over his lengthy fictional existence:\n\nAs depicted in the pulps, The Shadow wore a wide-brimmed black hat and a black, crimson-lined cloak with an upturned collar over a standard black business suit. In the 1940s comic books, the later comic book series, and the 1994 film starring Alec Baldwin, he wore either the black hat or a wide-brimmed, black fedora and a crimson scarf just below his nose and across his mouth and chin. Both the cloak and scarf covered either a black double-breasted trench coat or a regular black suit. As seen in some of the later comics series, The Shadow also would wear his hat and scarf with either a black Inverness coat or Inverness cape.\n\nIn the radio drama, which debuted in 1937, The Shadow was an invisible avenger who had learned, while \"traveling through the Orient,\" \"the mysterious power to cloud men's minds, so they could not see him.\" This feature of the character was born out of necessity: Time constraints of 1930s radio made it difficult to explain to listeners where The Shadow was hiding and how he was remaining concealed. Thus, the character was given the power to escape human sight. Voice effects were added to suggest The Shadow's seeming omnipresence. To explain this power, The Shadow was described as a master of hypnotism, as explicitly stated in several radio episodes.\n\nIn the print adventures, The Shadow's real name is Kent Allard. A famed aviator who fought for the French during World War I, he became known by the alias the Black Eagle, according to one character in \"The Shadow's Shadow\" (1933), although later stories revised this alias as the Dark Eagle, beginning with \"The Shadow Unmasks\" (1937). After the war, Allard finds a new challenge in waging war on criminals. Allard falsifies his death in the South American jungles, then returns to the United States. Arriving in New York City, he adopts numerous identities to conceal his existence.\n\nOne of the identities Allard assumes—indeed, the best known—is that of Lamont Cranston, a \"wealthy young man-about-town.\" In the pulps, Cranston is a separate character; Allard frequently disguises himself as Cranston and adopts his identity (\"The Shadow Laughs,\" 1931). While Cranston travels the world, Allard assumes his identity in New York. In their first meeting, Allard, as The Shadow, threatens Cranston, saying he has arranged to switch signatures on various documents and other means that will allow him to take over the Lamont Cranston identity entirely unless Cranston agrees to allow Allard to impersonate him when he is abroad. Although alarmed at first, Cranston accepts the irony of the situation and agrees. The two men sometimes meet in order to impersonate each other (\"Crime over Miami\", 1940). The disguise works well because Allard and Cranston resemble each other (\"Dictator of Crime\", 1941).\n\nHis other disguises include businessman Henry Arnaud, who first appears in \"The Black Master\" (March 1, 1932), which revealed that, like Cranston, there is a real Henry Arnaud; elderly Isaac Twambley, who first appears in \"No Time For Murder\"; and Fritz, who first appears in \"The Living Shadow\" (April 1931). In his Fritz disguise, he sometimes takes the place of the doddering old slow-witted, uncommunicative janitor who works at police headquarters in order to listen in on conversations and to look at evidence.\n\nIn the 2015 Altus Press novel \"The Sinister Shadow\" by Will Murray, The Shadow assumed the identity of the celebrated criminologist George Clarendon of Chicago, who is a past member of the Cobalt Club as well as a long-time friend of New York City Police Commissioner Ralph Weston. \n\nFor the first half of The Shadow's tenure in the pulps, his past and identity are ambiguous. In \"The Living Shadow\", a thug claims to have seen the Shadow's face and thought he saw \"a piece of white that looked like a bandage.\" In \"The Black Master\" and \"The Shadow's Shadow\", the villains both see The Shadow's true face and remark that The Shadow is a man of many faces with no face of his own. It was not until the August 1937 issue, \"The Shadow Unmasks\", that The Shadow's real name was revealed.\n\nIn the radio drama, the Allard secret identity was dropped for simplicity's sake. On the radio, The Shadow was only Lamont Cranston; he had no other aliases or disguises.\n\nThe Shadow has a network of agents who assist him in his war on crime. These include:\n\nThough initially wanted by the police, The Shadow also works with and through them, notably gleaning information from his many chats (as Cranston) with police commissioners Ralph Weston and Wainwright Barth while at the Cobalt Club; the latter is also Cranston's uncle. (Jonathan Winters portrayed him in the 1994 film.) Weston believes that Cranston is merely a rich playboy who dabbles in detective work. Another police contact is Detective (later Inspector) Joseph Cardona, a key character in many Shadow novels.\n\nIn contrast to the pulps, \"The Shadow\" radio drama limited the cast of major characters to The Shadow, Commissioner Weston, and Margo Lane, the last of whom was created specifically for the radio series, as it was believed the abundance of agents would make it difficult to distinguish between characters. Harry Vincent appeared as an agent of The Shadow in the first episode, \"The Death House Rescue.\" Clyde Burke and Moe Shrevnitz (identified only as \"Shrevvy\") made occasional appearances, but not as agents of The Shadow. Lieutenant Cardona was a minor character in several episodes. Shrevvy was merely an acquaintance of Cranston and Lane, and occasionally Cranston's chauffeur.\n\nThe Shadow also faces a wide variety of enemies, ranging from kingpins and mad scientists to international spies. Among his recurring foes are Shiwan Khan (seen in \"The Golden Master,\" \"Shiwan Khan Returns,\" \"The Invincible Shiwan Khan,\" and \"Masters of Death)\"; Dr. Rodil Moquino, the Voodoo Master (\"The Voodoo Master,\" \"The City of Doom,\" and \"Voodoo Trail\"); Bernard Stark, the Prince of Evil (\"The Prince of Evil,\" \"The Murder Genius,\" \"The Man Who Died Twice,\" and \"The Devil's Paymaster,\" all written by Theodore Tinsley); and the Wasp (\"The Wasp\" and \"The Wasp Returns\"). The only recurring criminal organization he fought was the Hand (\"The Hand,\" \"Murder for Sale,\" \"Chicago Crime,\" \"Crime Rides the Sea,\" and \"Realm of Doom\"), where he defeated one Finger of the organization in each book. In addition, the villain King Kauger from the Shadow story \"Wizard of Crime\" is the unseen mastermind behind the events of \"Intimidation, Inc.\" The organization known as \"The Silent Seven\" was referred to in the previous title \"The Death Tower.\" Villains Diamond Bert Farwell, Isaac Coffran, Steve Cronin, Spotter, and Birdie Crull all originated in the first two pulps and returned at least once.\n\nThe series featured a myriad of one-shot villains, including the Red Envoy, the Death Giver, Gray Fist, the Black Dragon, the Silver Skull, the Red Blot, the Black Falcon, the Cobra, Gaspard Zemba, the Black Master, Five-Face, the Gray Ghost, and Dr. Z.\n\nThe Shadow also battles collectives of criminals, such as the aforementioned Hand and Silent Seven, the Salamanders, and the Hydra.\n\nIn early 1930, Street & Smith hired David Chrisman and Bill Sweets to adapt the \"Detective Story Magazine\" to radio format. Chrisman and Sweets thought the program should be introduced by a mysterious storyteller. A young scriptwriter, Harry Charlot, suggested the name of \"The Shadow.\" Thus, \"The Shadow\" premiered over CBS airwaves on July 31, 1930, as the host of the \"Detective Story Hour\", narrating \"tales of mystery and suspense from the pages of the premier detective fiction magazine.\" The bulk of the radio show was written primarily by Sidney Slon. The narrator was first voiced by James La Curto, but became a national sensation when radio veteran Frank Readick, Jr. assumed the role and gave it \"a hauntingly sibilant quality that thrilled radio listeners.\"\n\nFollowing a brief tenure as narrator of Street & Smith's \"Detective Story Hour\", \"The Shadow\" character was used to host segments of \"The Blue Coal Radio Revue\", airing on Sundays at 5:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. This marked the beginning of a long association between the radio persona and sponsor Blue Coal.\n\nWhile functioning as a narrator of \"The Blue Coal Radio Revue\", the character was recycled by Street & Smith in October 1931, for its newly created \"Love Story Hour\". Contrary to dozens of encyclopedias, published reference guides, and even Walter Gibson himself, The Shadow never served as narrator of \"Love Story Hour\". He appeared only in advertisements for \"The Shadow Magazine\" at the end of each episode.\n\nIn October 1932, the radio persona temporarily moved to NBC. Frank Readick Jr. again played the role of the sinister-voiced host on Mondays and Wednesdays, both at 6:30 p.m., with La Curto taking occasional turns as the title character.\n\nReadick returned as The Shadow to host a final CBS mystery anthology that fall. The series disappeared from CBS airwaves on March 27, 1935, due to Street & Smith's insistence that the radio storyteller be completely replaced by the master crime-fighter described in Walter B. Gibson's ongoing pulps.\n\nStreet & Smith entered into a new broadcasting agreement with Blue Coal in 1937, and that summer Gibson teamed with scriptwriter Edward Hale Bierstadt to develop the new series. \"The Shadow\" returned to network airwaves on September 26, 1937, over the Mutual Broadcasting System. Thus began the \"official\" radio drama, with 22-year-old Orson Welles starring as Lamont Cranston, a \"wealthy young man about town.\" Once \"The Shadow\" joined Mutual as a half-hour series on Sunday evenings, the program was broadcast by Mutual until December 26, 1954.\n\nWelles did not speak the signature line, \"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men?\" Instead, Readick did, using a water glass next to his mouth for the echo effect. The famous catchphrase was accompanied by the strains of an excerpt from Opus 31 of the Camille Saint-Saëns classical composition, \"Le Rouet d'Omphale.\"\n\nAfter Welles departed the show in 1938, Bill Johnstone was chosen to replace him and voiced the character for five seasons. Following Johnstone's departure, The Shadow was portrayed by such actors as Bret Morrison (the longest tenure, with 10 years total in two separate runs), John Archer, and Steven Courtleigh (the actors were rarely credited).\n\n\"The Shadow\" also inspired another radio hit, \"The Whistler\", with a similarly mysterious narrator.\n\nThe radio drama also introduced female characters into The Shadow's realm, most notably Margo Lane (played by Agnes Moorehead, among others) as Cranston's love interest, crime-solving partner, and the only person who knows his identity as The Shadow. Four years later, the character was introduced into the pulp novels. Her sudden, unexplained appearance in the pulps annoyed readers and generated a flurry of hate mail printed on \"The Shadow Magazine's\" letters page.\n\nLane was described as Cranston's \"friend and companion\" in later episodes, although the exact nature of their relationship was unclear. In the early scripts of the radio drama the character's name was spelled \"Margot.\" The name itself was originally inspired by Margot Stevenson, the Broadway ingénue who would later be chosen to voice Lane opposite Welles's The Shadow during \"the 1938 Goodrich summer season of the radio drama.\" In the 1994 film in which Penelope Ann Miller played the character, she is described as being telepathic and hence aware of, but specifically immune to, The Shadow's abilities.\n\nIn 1968 Metro Record's \"Leo the Lion\" label released an LP titled \"The Official Adventures of The Shadow\" (CH-1048) with two original 15-minute radio-style productions written by John Fleming: \"The Computer Calculates, but The Shadow Knows\" and \"Air Freight Fracas.\" Bret Morrison, Grace Matthews, and Santos Ortega reprised their roles as Cranston/The Shadow, Margo Lane, and Commissioner Weston. Ken Roberts also returned as the announcer. \nThroughout the 1970s and 1980s, several dozen LPs appeared in print from other record labels that featured recordings made from the original broadcast Shadow radio show dramas. With the advent of the compact disc, more and more of the radio shows were remastered for home use.\n\n\"The Shadow\" has been adapted for the comics several times during his long history; his first comics appearance was on June 17, 1940, as a syndicated daily newspaper comic strip offered through the Ledger Syndicate. The strip's story continuity was written by Walter B. Gibson, with plot lines adapted from the Shadow pulps, and the strip was illustrated by Vernon Greene.\n\nThe comic strip, which ran until June 20, 1942, comprised 14 stories:\n\n\n\"The Shadow\" daily was collected decades later in two comic book series from two different publishers (see below), first in 1988 and then in 1999.\n\nTo both cross-promote \"The Shadow\" and attract a younger audience to its other pulp magazines, Street & Smith published 101 issues of the comic book \"Shadow Comics\" from Vol. 1, #1 – Vol. 9, #5 (March 1940 – Sept. 1949). A Shadow story led off each issue, with the remainder of the stories being strips based on other Street & Smith pulp heroes.\n\nIn \"Mad\" #4 (April–May 1953), \"The Shadow\" was spoofed by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder. Their character was called \"The Shadow'\" (with an apostrophe), which is short for \"Lamont Shadowskeedeeboomboom.\" The Shadow' is invisible as in the radio series; when he makes himself visible, he is attired like the pulp character but is very short and ugly; his companion, \"Margo Pain,\" begs him to cloud her mind again. Throughout the story, someone is trying to kill Margo, getting \"Shad,\" as she calls him, into various predicaments: He is beaten up by gangsters and has a piano dropped on him. He tricks Margo into an outhouse (the interior of which is an impossibly huge mansion) that he demolishes with dynamite. As The Shadow' gleefully presses the detonator, he says, \"NOBODY knows to whom the voice of the invisible Shadow' belongs!\" This story was reprinted in \"The Brothers Mad\" (ibooks, New York, 2002, ).\n\nLamont Shadowskeedeeboomboom returned in \"Mad\" #14 (August 1954) to guest-star in \"Manduck the Magician,\" a spoof by Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder of the \"Mandrake the Magician\" comic strip. In this story, Lamont Shadowskeedeeboomboom lures Manduck and Loathar to his home on the pretense of wanting to buy 100 cases of Manduck's snake oil; in reality, he has learned that Manduck also has \"the secret power to cloud men's minds, and so in order to keep [his] secret exclusive,\" he intends to destroy Manduck. A battle of hypnotic gesturing ensues, during which Loathar somehow also has the power. Each character turns himself or one or two of the others into one of the other characters, culminating in three Manducks who all gesture hypnotically, causing a massive explosion that leaves only one Manduck who may or may not be the real one. Manduck's girlfriend, Narda, declares that whomever he really is, \"Only one of you is dear to my heart and that one is... the one with the most loot!\" This story was reprinted in \"Mad Strikes Back!\" (ibooks, New York, 2002, ).\n\nDuring the superhero revival of the 1960s, Archie Comics published an eight-issue series, \"The Shadow\" (Aug. 1964 – Sept. 1965), under the company's Mighty Comics imprint. In the first issue, The Shadow was loosely based on the radio version, but with blond hair. In issue #2 (Sept. 1964), the character was transformed into a campy, heavily muscled superhero in a green and blue costume by writer Robert Bernstein and artist John Rosenberger. Later issues of this eight-issue series were written by Superman co-creator Jerry Siegel.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, DC Comics published an \"atmospheric interpretation\" of the character by writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Michael Kaluta in a 12-issue series (Nov. 1973 – Sept. 1975) attempting to be faithful to both the pulp-magazine character and radio-drama character. Kaluta drew issues 1–4 and 6 and was followed by Frank Robbins and then E. R. Cruz. Fellow pulp fiction hero the Avenger guest-starred in issue #11. The Shadow also appeared in DC's \"Batman\" #253 (Nov. 1973), in which Batman teams with an aging Shadow and calls the famous crime fighter his \"biggest inspiration.\" In \"Batman\" #259 (Dec. 1974), Batman again meets The Shadow, and we learn The Shadow saved Bruce Wayne's life when the future Batman was a boy and that The Shadow knows Batman's secret identity. (He assures Batman, however, that his secret is safe with him.)\n\nThe Shadow is also referenced in DC's \"Detective Comics\" #446 (1975), page 4, panel 2: Batman, out of costume and in disguise as an older night janitor, makes a crime fighting acknowledgement, in a thought balloon, to the Shadow.\n\nIn 1986, another DC adaptation was developed by Howard Chaykin. This four-issue miniseries, \"The Shadow: Blood and Judgement\", brought The Shadow to modern-day New York. While initially successful, this version proved unpopular with traditional Shadow fans because it depicted The Shadow using two Uzi submachine guns, as well as featuring a strong strain of black comedy and extreme violence throughout.\n\n\"The Shadow\", set in our modern era, was continued in 1987 as a monthly DC comics series by writer Andy Helfer (editor of the miniseries); it was drawn primarily by artists Bill Sienkiewicz (issues 1–6) and Kyle Baker (issues 8–19 and two \"Shadow Annual\"s).\n\nIn 1988, O'Neil and Kaluta, with inker Russ Heath, returned to The Shadow with the Marvel Comics graphic novel \"The Shadow: Hitler's Astrologer\", set during World War II. This one-shot appeared in both hardcover and trade paperback editions.\n\nThe Vernon Greene/Walter Gibson Shadow newspaper comic strip from the early 1940s was collected by Malibu Graphics (Malibu Comics) under its Eternity Comics imprint, beginning with the first issue of \"Crime Classics\" dated July 1988. Each cover was illustrated by Greene and colored by one of Eternity's colorists. A total of 13 issues appeared featuring just the black-and-white daily until the final issue, dated November, 1989. Some of the Shadow storylines were contained in one issue, while others were continued over into the next. When a Shadow story ended, another tale would begin in the same issue. This back-to-back format continued until the final 13th issue. Here is a list of the reprinted strip's storylines:\n\"Crime Classics\"\n1 & 2, \"Riddle of the Sealed Box\"; \n2 & 3, \"Mystery of the Sleeping Gas\"; \n3 & 4, \"The Shadow vs Hoang Hu\"; \n4, 5, & 6, \"Danger on Shark Island\";\n6, 7, & 8, \"The Shadow vs The Bund\";\n8, 9, & 10, \"The Shadow vs Shiwan Khan\";\n10, 11, & 12, \"The Shadow vs The Swindlers\";\n12 & 13, \"The Shadow and the Adele Varne Mystery\";\n13, \"Robberies at Lake Calada.\"\nDave Stevens' nostalgic comics series \"Rocketeer\" contains a great number of pop culture references to the 1930s. Various characters from the Shadow pulps make appearances in the storyline published in the \"Rocketeer Adventure Magazine\", including The Shadow's famous alter ego Lamont Cranston. Two issues were published by in 1988 and 1989, but the third and final installment did not appear until years later, finally appearing in 1995 from Dark Horse Comics. All three issues were then collected by Dark Horse into a slick trade paperback titled \"The Rocketeer: Cliff's New York Adventure\" ().\n\nIn 1989, DC released in graphic novel hardcover reprinting five issues (#1–4 and 6 by Dennis O'Neil and Michael Kaluta) of their 1970s series as \"The Private Files of The Shadow\". The volume also featured a new Shadow adventure drawn by Kaluta.\n\nFrom 1989 to 1992, DC published a new Shadow series, \"The Shadow Strikes!\", written by Gerard Jones and Eduardo Barreto. This series was set in the 1930s and returned The Shadow to his pulp origins. During its run, it featured The Shadow's first team-up with Doc Savage, another popular hero of the pulp magazine era. The two characters appeared together in a four-issue story that crossed back and forth between each character's DC comic series. \"The Shadow Strikes\" often led The Shadow into encounters with well-known celebrities of the 1930s, such as Albert Einstein, Amelia Earhart, Charles Lindbergh, union organizer John L. Lewis, and Chicago gangsters Frank Nitti and Jake Guzik. In issue #7, The Shadow meets a radio announcer named Grover Mills, a character based on the young Orson Welles, who has been impersonating The Shadow on the radio. The character's name is taken from Grover's Mill, New Jersey, the name of the small town where the Martians land in Welles's 1938 radio broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds.\" When Shadow rights holder Condé Nast increased its licensing fee, DC concluded the series after 31 issues and one \"Annual\"; it became the longest-running Shadow comic series since Street & Smith's original 1940s series.\n\nDuring the early-to-mid-1990s, Dark Horse Comics acquired the rights to The Shadow from Condé Nast. It published the Shadow miniseries \"The Shadow: In the Coils of Leviathan\" (four issues) in 1993, and \"The Shadow: Hell's Heat Wave\" (three issues) in 1995. \"In the Coils of Leviathan\" was later collected by Dark Horse in 1994 as a trade paperback. Both series were written by Joel Goss and Michael Kaluta and drawn by Gary Gianni. A one-shot issue, \"The Shadow and the Mysterious Three\", was published by Dark Horse in 1994, again written by Joel Goss and Michael Kaluta, with Stan Manoukian and Vince Roucher taking over the illustration duties but working from Kaluta's layouts. A comics adaptation of the 1994 film \"The Shadow\" was published in two issues by Dark Horse as part of the movie's merchandising campaign. The script was by Goss and Kaluta and drawn by Kaluta. It was collected and published in England by Boxtree as a graphic novel tie-in for the film's British release. Emulating DC's earlier team-up, Dark Horse also published a two-issue miniseries in 1995 called \"The Shadow and Doc Savage: The Case of the Shrieking Skeletons\". It was written by Steve Vance and illustrated by Manoukian and Roucher. Both issues' covers were drawn by Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens. A final Dark Horse Shadow team-up was published in 1995: another one-shot issue, \"Ghost and the Shadow\", written by Doug Moench, pencilled by H. M. Baker, and inked by Bernard Kolle. It was set in modern times.\n\nThe Shadow made an uncredited cameo in issue #2 of DC's 1996 four issue miniseries \"Kingdom Come\", re-released as a trade paperback in 1997. The Shadow appears in the nightclub scene standing in the background next to The Question and Rorschach.\n\nThe early 1940s Shadow newspaper daily strip was reprinted by Avalon Communications under its ACG Classix imprint. The Shadow daily began appearing in the first issue of \"Pulp Action\" comics. It carried no monthly date or issue number on the cover, only a 1999 copyright and a \"Pulp Action #1\" notation at the bottom of the inside cover. Each issue's cover is a colorized panel blow-up, taken from one of the reprinted strips. The eighth issue uses for its cover a Shadow serial black-and-white film still, with several hand-drawn alterations. The first issue of \"Pulp Action\" is devoted entirely to reprinting the Shadow daily, but subsequent issues began offering back-up stories not involving The Shadow in every issue. These Shadow strip reprints stopped with \"Pulp Action\"s eighth issue, before the story was complete. Here are the strip's reprinted storylines (the last issue carries a 2000 copyright date):\n\n\"Pulp Action\":\n1, \"Riddle of the Sealed Box\"; \n2, \"Mystery of the Sleeping Gas\"; \n3 & 4, \"The Shadow vs. The Swindlers\"; \n5 & 6, \"The Shadow and the Adele Varne Mystery\";\n7 & 8, \"The Shadow and the Darvin Fortune.\"\n\nIn August 2011, Dynamite licensed \"The Shadow\" from Condé Nast for an ongoing comic book series and several limited run miniseries. Its first on-going series was written by Garth Ennis and illustrated by Aaron Campbell; it debuted on April 19, 2012. This series ran for 26 issues; the regular series ended in May 2014, but a prologue issue #0 was published in July 2014. Dynamite followed with the release of an eight-issue miniseries, \"Masks\", teaming the 1930s Shadow with Dynamite's other pulp hero comic book adaptations, The Spider, the Green Hornet and Kato, and a 1930s Zorro, plus four other heroes of the pulp era from Dynamite's comics lineup. Dynamite offered a 10-issue Shadow miniseries, \"The Shadow Year One\", followed by the team-up five-issue miniseries, \"The Shadow/Green Hornet: Dark Nights\", and a Shadow six-issue miniseries set in the modern era, \"The Shadow Now\". In August 2015, Dynamite Entertainment launched volume 2 of \"The Shadow\", a new ongoing series written by Cullen Bunn and drawn by Giovanni Timpano. \n\nThe Shadow character has been adapted for film shorts and films.\n\nIn 1931 Universal Pictures created a series of six film shorts based on the popular \"Detective Story Hour\" radio program, narrated by The Shadow. The first short, \"A Burglar to the Rescue,\" was filmed in New York City and features the voice of The Shadow on radio, Frank Readick Jr. Beginning with the second short, \"The House of Mystery\", the series was produced in Hollywood without the voice of Readick as The Shadow; it was followed by \"The Circus Show-Up\" and three additional shorts the following year with other voice actors portraying The Shadow.\n\nThe film \"The Shadow Strikes\" was released in 1937, starring Rod La Rocque in the title role. Lamont Granston (as his name was spelled in both opening credits and a newspaper article) assumes the secret identity of \"The Shadow\" in order to thwart an attempted robbery at an attorney's office. Both \"The Shadow Strikes\" (1937) and its sequel, \"International Crime\" (1938), were released by Grand National Pictures.\n\nLa Rocque returned the following year in \"International Crime\". In this version, reporter Lamont Cranston (despite being spelled Granston in the previous film) is an amateur criminologist and detective who uses the name of \"The Shadow\" as a radio gimmick. Thomas Jackson portrayed Police Commissioner Weston, and Astrid Allwyn was cast as Phoebe Lane, Cranston's assistant.\n\n\"The Shadow\", a 15-chapter movie serial, produced by Columbia Pictures and starring Victor Jory, premiered in theaters in 1940. The serial's villain, The Black Tiger, is a criminal mastermind who sabotages rail lines and factories across the United States. Lamont Cranston must become his shadowy alter ego in order to unmask the criminal and halt his fiendish crime spree. As The Shadow, Jory wears an all-black suit and cloak, as well as a black bandana that helps conceal his facial features.\n\nLow-budget motion picture studio Monogram Pictures produced a trio of quickie Shadow B-movie features in 1946 starring Kane Richmond: \"The Shadow Returns\", \"Behind the Mask\" and \"The Missing Lady\". Richmond's Shadow wore all black, including a trench coat, a wide-brimmed fedora, and a full face-mask similar to the type worn by movie serial hero The Masked Marvel, instead of the character's signature black cape with red lining and red scarf.\n\nEpisodes of a television pilot shot in 1957 were edited into the 1958 theatrical feature \"Invisible Avenger\", rereleased in 1962 as \"Bourbon Street Shadows\".\n\nIn 1994 the character was adapted once again into a feature film, \"The Shadow,\" starring Alec Baldwin as Lamont Cranston and Penelope Ann Miller as Margo Lane. As the film opens, Cranston has become the evil and corrupt Yin-Ko (literally \"Dark Eagle\"), a brutal warlord and opium smuggler in early 1930s Mongolia. Yin-Ko is kidnapped by agents of the mysterious Tulku, who begins to reform the warlord using the psychic power of his evolved mind to restore Cranston's humanity. The Tulku also teaches him the ability to \"cloud men's minds\" using psychic power in order to fight evil in the world. Cranston eventually returns to his native New York City and takes up the guise of the mysterious crime fighter \"The Shadow,\" in payment to humanity for his past evil misdeeds: \"Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men? The Shadow \"knows\" ...\"\n\nHis nemesis in the film is adapted from the pulp series' long-running Asian villain (and for the film, a fellow telepath), the evil Shiwan Khan (John Lone), a descendant of Genghis Khan. He seeks to finish his ancestor's legacy of conquering the world by first destroying New York City, using a newly developed atomic bomb, in a show of his power. Khan nearly succeeds in this, but he is thwarted by The Shadow in a final psychic duel of death: Cranston, as The Shadow, imposes his will on, and defeats, Khan during a psychokinetically enhanced battle in a mirrored room, which has exploded into thousands of flying mirror shards. Focusing his mind's psychokinetic power, The Shadow flips a flying piece of jagged mirror in mid-air and then hurls it directly at a spot on Khan's forehead; this does not kill him, it renders him unconscious. To save both the warlord and the world, The Shadow secretly arranges with one of his agents, an administrative doctor at an unidentified New York asylum for the criminally insane, to have Khan locked away permanently in a padded cell; Khan's badly-injured frontal lobe, which controlled his psychic powers, having been surgically removed.\n\nThe film combines elements from The Shadow pulp novels and comic books with the aforementioned ability to cloud minds described only on the radio show. In the film Alec Baldwin, as The Shadow, wears a red-lined black cloak and a long red scarf that covers his mouth and chin; he also wears a black, double-breasted trench coat and a wide-brimmed, black slouch hat. Contrarily to pulp novels, he is armed with a pair of modified M1911s .45-caliber semi-automatic pistols that for the film have longer barrels, are nickel-plated and have ivory handles. In reality, the prop guns were modified LAR Grizzly Win Mags nicknamed \"Silver Heat.\" The film also displays a first: Cranston's ability to conjure a false face whenever he is in his guise as The Shadow, in keeping with his physical portrayal in the pulps and the comics.\n\nThe film was financially and critically unsuccessful.\n\nOn December 11, 2006, the website SuperHero Hype reported that director Sam Raimi and Michael Uslan would co-produce a new \"Shadow\" film for Columbia Pictures.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Raimi stated, \"I don't have any news on \"The Shadow\" at this time, except that the company that I have with Josh Donen, my producing partner, we've got the rights to \"The Shadow.\" I love the character very much and we're trying to work on a story that'll do justice to the character.\"\n\nOn August 23, 2012, the website ShadowFan reported that during a Q&A session at San Diego's 2012 Comic-Con, director Sam Raimi, when asked about the status of his Shadow film project, stated they had not been able to develop a good script and the film would not be produced as planned.\n\nA video game version of \"The Shadow\" was developed by Ocean Software to tie in with the 1994 film and was supposed to be published on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System but after the low box office gross of the film, the game was never released despite being completed. Since then, a ROM of the game has been leaked online.\n\nTwo attempts were made to adapt the character to television. The first, in 1954, was titled \"The Shadow\" and starred Tom Helmore as Lamont Cranston.\n\nThe second attempt in 1958 was titled \"The Invisible Avenger\"; it never aired. The two episodes produced were compiled into a theatrical film and released with the same title. It was re-released with additional footage in 1962 as \"Bourbon Street Shadows\". Starring Richard Derr as The Shadow, the film depicts Lamont Cranston investigating the murder of a New Orleans bandleader. The film is notable as the second directorial effort of James Wong Howe, who directed only one of the two unaired episodes.\n\nWhen Bob Kane and Bill Finger first developed Kane's \"Bat-Man,\" they patterned the character after pulp mystery men such as The Shadow. Finger then used \"Partners of Peril\"—a Shadow pulp written by Theodore Tinsley—as the basis for Batman's debut story, \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate.\" Finger later publicly acknowledged that \"my first Batman script was a takeoff on a Shadow story\" and that \"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps.\" This influence was further evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals and not above using firearms. Decades later, noted comic book writer Dennis O'Neil would have Batman and The Shadow meet in \"Batman\" #253 (November 1973) and \"Batman\" #259 (December 1974) to solve crimes. In the former, Batman acknowledged that The Shadow was his biggest influence and in the latter, The Shadow reveals to Batman that he knows his true identity of Bruce Wayne but assures him that his secret is safe with him.\n\nThe Shadow is mentioned by science fiction author Philip José Farmer as being a member of his widespread and hero-filled Wold Newton family. \n\nAlan Moore has credited The Shadow as one of the key influences for the creation of V, the title character in his DC Comics miniseries \"V for Vendetta\", which later became a Warner Bros. feature film released in 2006.\n\nThe protagonist of the 1990s Disney cartoon \"Darkwing Duck\" has a striking resemblance to The Shadow.\n\nThe Shadow also appears to have been a major inspiration behind the comic book crime-fighting hero The Silver Shroud in Bethesda's post-apocalyptic video game \"Fallout 4\".\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "143247", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143247", "title": "The War of the Worlds (1938 radio drama)", "text": "The War of the Worlds (1938 radio drama)\n\n\"The War of the Worlds\" is an episode of the American radio drama anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" directed and narrated by actor and future filmmaker Orson Welles as an adaptation of H. G. Wells's novel \"The War of the Worlds\" (1898). It was performed and broadcast live as a Halloween episode at 8 p.m. on Sunday, October 30, 1938, over the Columbia Broadcasting System radio network. The episode became famous for allegedly causing panic among its listening audience, though the scale of that panic is disputed, as the program had relatively few listeners.\n\nThe one-hour program began with the theme music for the \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and an announcement that the evening's show was an adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\". Orson Welles then read a prologue which was closely based on the opening of H.G. Wells' novel modified slightly to move the story's setting to 1939. For about the next twenty minutes, the broadcast was presented as a typical evening of radio programming being interrupted by a series of news bulletins. The first few news flashes occur during a presentation of \"live\" music and describe a series of odd explosions observed on Mars, followed by a seemingly unrelated report of an unusual object falling on a farm in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. The musical program returns briefly before being interrupted by a live report from Grover's Mill, where police officials and a crowd of curious onlookers have surrounded the strange cylindrical object that fell from the sky. The situation escalates when Martians emerge from the cylinder and attack using a heat-ray, which the panicked reporter at the scene describes until his audio feed abruptly goes dead. This is followed by a rapid series of increasingly alarming news updates detailing a devastating alien invasion taking place around the world and the futile efforts of the U.S. military to stop it. The first portion of the show climaxes with another live report from a Manhattan rooftop as giant Martian war machines release clouds of poisonous smoke across New York City. The reporter on the scene describes desperate citizens fleeing as the smoke approaches his location until he coughs and falls silent, after which the program took its first break. During the second half of the show, the style shifts to a more conventional radio drama format and follows a survivor (played by Welles) dealing with the aftermath of the invasion and the ongoing Martian occupation of Earth. As in the original novel, the story ends with the discovery that the Martians have been defeated by microbes rather than by humans.\n\nWelles's \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast has become famous for supposedly tricking some of its listeners into believing that a Martian invasion was actually taking place due to the \"breaking news\" style of storytelling employed in the first half of the show. The illusion of realism was furthered because the \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" was a sustaining show without commercial interruptions, and the first break in the program came almost 30 minutes after the introduction. Popular legend holds that some of the radio audience may have been listening to The Chase and Sanborn Hour with Edgar Bergen and tuned in to \"The War of the Worlds\" during a musical interlude, thereby missing the clear introduction indicating that the show was a drama; however, contemporary research suggests that this happened only in rare instances.\n\nIn the days after the adaptation, widespread outrage was expressed in the media. The program's news-bulletin format was described as deceptive by some newspapers and public figures, leading to an outcry against the broadcasters and calls for regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. Nevertheless, the episode secured Welles's fame as a dramatist.\n\n\"The War of the Worlds\" was the 17th episode of the CBS Radio series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air,\" which was broadcast at 8 pm ET on Sunday, October 30, 1938. H. G. Wells' original novel tells the story of a Martian invasion of Earth. The novel was adapted for radio by Howard Koch, who changed the primary setting from 19th-century England to the contemporary United States, with the landing point of the first Martian spacecraft changed to rural Grover's Mill, an unincorporated village in West Windsor Township, New Jersey.\n\nThe program's format was a simulated live newscast of developing events. The first two-thirds of the hour-long play is a contemporary retelling of events of the novel, presented as news bulletins interrupting programs of dance music. \"I had conceived the idea of doing a radio broadcast in such a manner that a crisis would actually seem to be happening,\" Welles later said, \"and would be broadcast in such a dramatized form as to appear to be a real event taking place at that time, rather than a mere radio play.\" This approach was similar to Ronald Knox's radio hoax \"Broadcasting the Barricades\", about a riot overtaking London, that was broadcast by the BBC in 1926, which Welles later said gave him the idea for \"The War of the Worlds\". A 1927 drama aired by Adelaide station 5CL depicted an invasion of Australia via the same techniques and inspired reactions similar to those of the Welles broadcast.\n\nHe was also influenced by the \"Columbia Workshop\" presentations \"The Fall of the City\", a 1937 radio play in which Welles played the role of an omniscient announcer, and \"Air Raid\", a vibrant as-it-happens drama starring Ray Collins that aired October 27, 1938. Welles had previously used a newscast format for \"Julius Caesar\" (September 11, 1938), with H. V. Kaltenborn providing historical commentary throughout the story.\n\n\"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast used techniques similar to those of \"The March of Time,\" the CBS news documentary and dramatization radio series. Welles was a member of the program's regular cast, having first performed on \"The March of Time\" in March 1935. \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" and \"The March of Time\" shared many cast members, as well as sound effects chief Ora D. Nichols.\n\nWelles discussed his fake newscast idea with producer John Houseman and associate producer Paul Stewart; together, they decided to adapt a work of science fiction. They considered adapting M. P. Shiel's \"The Purple Cloud\" and Arthur Conan Doyle's \"The Lost World\" before purchasing the radio rights to \"The War of the Worlds\". Houseman later wrote that he suspected Welles had never read it.\n\nHoward Koch had written the first drafts for the Mercury Theatre broadcasts \"Hell on Ice\" (October 9), \"Seventeen\" (October 16), and \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (October 23). Monday, October 24, he was assigned to adapt \"The War of the Worlds\" for broadcast the following Sunday night.\n\nTuesday night, 36 hours before rehearsals were to begin, Koch telephoned Houseman in what the producer characterized as \"deep distress\". Koch said he could not make \"The War of the Worlds\" interesting or credible as a radio play, a conviction echoed by his secretary Anne Froelick, a typist and aspiring writer whom Houseman had hired to assist him. With only his own abandoned script for \"Lorna Doone\" to fall back on, Houseman told Koch to continue adapting the Wells fantasy. He joined Koch and Froelick and they worked on the script throughout the night. On Wednesday night, the first draft was finished on schedule.\n\nOn Thursday, associate producer Paul Stewart held a cast reading of the script, with Koch and Houseman making necessary changes. That afternoon, Stewart made an acetate recording, with no music or sound effects. Welles, immersed in rehearsing the Mercury stage production of \"Danton's Death\" scheduled to open the following week, played the record at an editorial meeting that night in his suite at the St. Regis Hotel. After hearing \"Air Raid\" on the \"Columbia Workshop\" earlier that same evening, Welles viewed the script as dull. He stressed the importance of inserting news flashes and eyewitness accounts into the script to create a sense of urgency and excitement.\n\nHouseman, Koch, and Stewart reworked the script that night, increasing the number of news bulletins and using the names of real places and people whenever possible. Friday afternoon, the script was sent to Davidson Taylor, executive producer for CBS, and the network legal department. Their response was that the script was 'too' credible and its realism had to be toned down. As using the names of actual institutions could be actionable, CBS insisted upon some 28 changes in phrasing.\n\n\"Under protest and with a deep sense of grievance we changed the Hotel Biltmore to a nonexistent \"Park Plaza\", \"Transamerica Radio News\" to \"Inter-Continental Radio News\", the \"Columbia Broadcasting Building\" to \"Broadcasting Building\",\" Houseman wrote. \"The United States Weather Bureau in Washington, D.C.\" was changed to \"The Government Weather Bureau,\" \"Princeton University Observatory\" to \"Princeton Observatory,\" \"McGill University\" in Montreal to \"Macmillan University\" in Toronto, \"New Jersey National Guard\" to \"State Militia,\" \"United States Signal Corps\" to \"Signal Corps,\" \"Langley Field\" to \"Langham Field,\" and \"St. Patrick's Cathedral\" to \"the cathedral.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Stewart rehearsed the show with the sound effects team, giving special attention to crowd scenes, the echo of cannon fire, and the sound of the boat horns in New York Harbor.\n\nEarly Sunday afternoon, Bernard Herrmann and his orchestra arrived in the studio, where Welles had taken over production of that evening's program.\n\nTo create the role of reporter Carl Phillips, actor Frank Readick went to the record library and played the recording of Herbert Morrison's radio report of the \"Hindenburg\" disaster over and over. Working with Bernard Herrmann and the orchestra that had to sound like a dance band fell to Paul Stewart, the person Welles would later credit as being largely responsible for the quality of \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast.\n\nWelles wanted the music to play for unbearably long stretches of time. The studio's emergency fill-in, a solo piano playing Debussy and Chopin, was heard several times. \"As it played on and on,\" Houseman wrote, \"its effect became increasingly sinister—a thin band of suspense stretched almost beyond endurance. That piano was the neatest trick of the show.\"\n\nDress rehearsal was scheduled for 6 pm.\n\n\"Our actual broadcasting time, from the first mention of the meteorites to the fall of New York City, was less than forty minutes,\" wrote Houseman. \"During that time, men travelled long distances, large bodies of troops were mobilized, cabinet meetings were held, savage battles fought on land and in the air. And millions of people accepted it—emotionally if not logically.\"\n\nThe cast of characters of \"The War of the Worlds\" appears in order as first heard in the broadcast.\n\n\"The War of the Worlds\" begins with a paraphrase of , updated to contemporary times. The announcer introduces Orson Welles:\n\nWe know now that in the early years of the 20th century, this world was being watched closely by intelligences greater than man's and yet as mortal as his own. We know now that as human beings busied themselves about their various concerns, they were scrutinized and studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might scrutinize the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacence, people went to and fro over the earth about their little affairs, serene in the assurance of their dominion over this small spinning fragment of solar driftwood which by chance or design man has inherited out of the dark mystery of Time and Space. Yet across an immense ethereal gulf, minds that are to our minds as ours are to the beasts in the jungle, intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic, regarded this earth with envious eyes and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. In the 39th year of the 20th century came the great disillusionment. It was near the end of October. Business was better. The war scare was over. More men were back at work. Sales were picking up. On this particular evening, October 30th, the Crossley service estimated that 32 million people were listening in on radios…\n\nThe radio program begins as a simulation of a normal evening radio broadcast featuring a weather report and music by \"Ramon Raquello and His Orchestra\" live from a local hotel ballroom. After a few minutes, the music begins to be interrupted by several news flashes about strange gas explosions on Mars. An interview is arranged with reporter Carl Phillips and Princeton-based Professor of Astronomy Richard Pierson, who dismisses speculation about life on Mars. The musical program returns temporarily but is interrupted again by news of a strange meteorite landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey. Phillips and Pierson are dispatched to the site, where a large crowd has gathered. Philips describes the chaotic atmosphere around the strange cylindrical object, and Pierson admits that he does not know exactly what it is, but that it seems to be made of an extraterrestrial metal. The cylinder unscrews, and Phillips describes the tentacled, horrific \"monster\" that emerges from inside. Police officers approach the Martian waving a flag of truce, but the invaders respond by firing a heat ray, which incinerates the delegation and ignites the nearby woods and cars as the crowd screams. Phillips's shouts about incoming flames are cut off mid-sentence, and after a moment of dead air, an announcer explains that the remote broadcast was interrupted due to \"some difficulty with our field transmission.\"\n\nAfter a brief \"piano interlude\", regular programming breaks down as the studio struggles with casualty and fire-fighting updates. A shaken Pierson speculates about Martian technology. The New Jersey state militia declares martial law and attacks the cylinder; a captain from their field headquarters lectures about the overwhelming force of properly-equipped infantry and the helplessness of the Martians, until a tripod rises from the pit. The tripod obliterates the militia, and the studio returns, now describing the Martians as an invading army. Emergency response bulletins give way to damage and evacuation reports as thousands of refugees clog the highways. Three Martian tripods from the cylinder destroy power stations and uproot bridges and railroads, reinforced by three others from a second cylinder that landed in the Great Swamp near Morristown, as gas explosions continue. The Secretary of the Interior addresses the nation.\n\nA live connection is established to a field artillery battery in the Watchung Mountains. Its gun crew damages a machine, resulting in a release of poisonous black smoke, before fading into the sound of coughing. The lead plane of a wing of bombers from Langham Field broadcasts its approach and remains on the air as their engines are burned by the heat ray and the plane dives on the invaders. Radio operators go active and fall silent. Although the bombers manage to destroy one machine, the remaining five are spreading black smoke across the Jersey Marshes into Newark.\n\nEventually, a news reporter, broadcasting from atop the Broadcasting Building, describes the Martian invasion of New York City – \"five great machines\" wading the Hudson \"like [men] wading through a brook\", black smoke drifting over the city, people diving into the East River \"like rats\", others in Times Square \"falling like flies\". He reads a final bulletin stating that Martian cylinders have fallen all over the country, then describes the smoke approaching down the street until he has a coughing fit and falls silent, leaving only the sounds of the city under attack in the background. Finally, a ham radio operator is heard calling, \"2X2L calling CQ, New York. Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there anyone on the air? Isn't there... anyone?\"\n\nAfter a period of silence comes the voice of announcer Dan Seymour:\n\nYou are listening to a CBS presentation of Orson Welles and the \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\", in an original dramatization of \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells. The performance will continue after a brief intermission. This is the Columbia Broadcasting System.\n\nThe last third of the program is a monologue and dialogue. Professor Pierson, having survived the attack on Grover's Mill, attempts to make contact with other humans. In Newark, he encounters an opportunistic militiaman who holds fascist ideals in regards to man's relationship with the Martians, and intends to use Martian weaponry to take control of both species. Declaring that he wants no part of \"his world\", Pierson leaves the stranger with his delusions. His journey takes him to the ruins of New York, where he discovers that the Martians have died – as with the novel, they fell victim to earthly pathogenic germs, to which they had no immunity. Life eventually returns to normal, and Pierson finishes writing his recollections of the invasion and its aftermath.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the play, Welles reassumed his role as host and told listeners that the broadcast was a Halloween concoction: the equivalent, he says, \"of dressing up in a sheet, jumping out of a bush and saying, 'Boo!'\" Popular mythology holds the disclaimer was hastily added to the broadcast at the insistence of CBS executives, as they became aware of panic inspired by the program. In fact, at the station break, network executive Davidson Taylor had attempted to prevent Welles, who had added the speech at the last minute, from reading it on air for fear of exposing the network to legal liability, but Welles delivered it anyway.\n\nRadio programming charts in Sunday newspapers listed the CBS drama, \"The War of the Worlds\". \"The New York Times\" for October 30, 1938, also included the show in its \"Leading Events of the Week\" (\"Tonight – Play: H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'\") and published a photograph of Welles with some of the Mercury players, captioned, \"Tonight's show is H. G. Wells' 'War of the Worlds'\".\n\nAnnouncements that \"The War of the Worlds\" is a dramatization of a work of fiction were made on the full CBS network at four points during the broadcast October 30, 1938: at the beginning, before the middle break, after the middle break, and at the end. The middle break was delayed 10 minutes to accommodate the dramatic content.\n\nAnother announcement was repeated on the full CBS network that same evening at 10:30 pm, 11:30 pm, and midnight: \"For those listeners who tuned in to Orson Welles's \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" broadcast from 8 to 9 pm Eastern Standard Time tonight and did not realize that the program was merely a modernized adaptation of H. G. Wells' famous novel \"War of the Worlds\", we are repeating the fact which was made clear four times on the program, that, while the names of some American cities were used, as in all novels and dramatizations, the entire story and all of its incidents were fictitious.\"\n\n\"In the first place, most people didn't hear the show.\"<br>- Frank Stanton, research director, CBS Radio Network and Radio Research Project\n\nProducer John Houseman noticed that at about 8:32 pm ET, CBS supervisor Davidson Taylor received a telephone call in the control room. Taylor left the studio and returned four minutes later, \"pale as death\", as he had been ordered to interrupt \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast immediately with an announcement of the program's fictional content. However, by the time the order was given, the program was already less than a minute away from its first scheduled break, and the fictional news reporter played by actor Ray Collins was choking on poison gas as the Martians overwhelmed New York.\n\nActor Stefan Schnabel recalled sitting in the anteroom after finishing his on-air performance. \"A few policemen trickled in, then a few more. Soon, the room was full of policemen and a massive struggle was going on between the police, page boys, and CBS executives, who were trying to prevent the cops from busting in and stopping the show. It was a show to witness.\"\n\nDuring the signoff theme, the phone began ringing. Houseman picked it up and the furious caller announced he was mayor of a Midwestern town, where mobs were in the streets. Houseman hung up quickly: \"For we were off the air now and the studio door had burst open.\"\n\nThe following hours were a nightmare. The building was suddenly full of people and dark-blue uniforms. Hustled out of the studio, we were locked into a small back office on another floor. Here we sat incommunicado while network employees were busily collecting, destroying, or locking up all scripts and records of the broadcast. Finally, the Press was let loose upon us, ravening for horror. How many deaths had \"we\" heard of? (Implying they knew of thousands.) What did \"we\" know of the fatal stampede in a Jersey hall? (Implying it was one of many.) What traffic deaths? (The ditches must be choked with corpses.) The suicides? (Haven't you heard about the one on Riverside Drive?) It is all quite vague in my memory and quite terrible.\n\nPaul White, head of CBS News, was quickly summoned to the office, \"and there bedlam reigned\", he wrote:\n\nThe telephone switchboard, a vast sea of light, could handle only a fraction of incoming calls. The haggard Welles sat alone and despondent. \"I'm through,\" he lamented, \"washed up.\" I didn't bother to reply to this highly inaccurate self-appraisal. I was too busy writing explanations to put on the air, reassuring the audience that it was safe. I also answered my share of incessant telephone calls, many of them from as far away as the Pacific Coast.\n\nBecause of the crowd of newspaper reporters, photographers, and police, the cast left the CBS building by the rear entrance. Aware of the sensation the broadcast had made, but not its extent, Welles went to the Mercury Theatre where an all-night rehearsal of \"Danton's Death\" was in progress. Shortly after midnight, one of the cast, a late arrival, told Welles that news about \"The War of the Worlds\" was being flashed in Times Square. They immediately left the theatre, and standing on the corner of Broadway and 42nd Street, they read the lighted bulletin that circled the \"New York Times\" building: ORSON WELLES CAUSES PANIC.\n\nSome listeners heard only a portion of the broadcast and, in the tension and anxiety prior to World War II, mistook it for a genuine news broadcast. Thousands of those people rushed to share the false reports with others or called CBS, newspapers, or the police to ask if the broadcast was real. Many newspapers assumed that the large number of phone calls and the scattered reports of listeners rushing about or even fleeing their homes proved the existence of a mass panic, but such behavior was never widespread.\n\nFuture \"Tonight Show\" host Jack Paar had announcing duties that night for Cleveland CBS affiliate WGAR. As panicked listeners called the studio, Paar attempted to calm them on the phone and on air by saying: \"The world is not coming to an end. Trust me. When have I ever lied to you?\" When the listeners started charging Paar with \"covering up the truth\", he called WGAR's station manager for help. Oblivious to the situation, the manager advised Paar to calm down and said that it was \"all a tempest in a teapot\".\n\nIn a 1975 interview with radio historian Chuck Schaden, radio actor Alan Reed recalled being one of several actors recruited to answer phone calls at CBS's New York headquarters.\n\nIn Concrete, Washington, phone lines and electricity suffered a short circuit at the Superior Portland Cement Company's substation. Residents were unable to call neighbors, family, or friends to calm their fears. Reporters who heard of the coincidental blackout sent the story over the newswire, and soon, Concrete was known worldwide.\n\nWelles continued with the rehearsal of \"Danton's Death\" (scheduled to open November 2), leaving shortly after dawn October 31. He was operating on three hours of sleep when CBS called him to a press conference. He read a statement that was later printed in newspapers nationwide and took questions from reporters:\n\nIn its editions of October 31, 1938, the \"Tucson Citizen\" reported that three Arizona affiliates of CBS (KOY in Phoenix, KTUC in Tucson and KSUN in Bisbee) had originally scheduled a delayed broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\" that night; CBS had shifted \"The Mercury Theater on the Air\" from Monday nights to Sunday nights on September 11, but the three affiliates preferred to keep the series in its original Monday slot so that it would not compete with NBC's top-rated \"Chase and Sanborn Hour\". However, late on that Sunday night, CBS contacted KOY and KTUC owner Burridge Butler and instructed him not to air the program the following night.\n\nWithin three weeks, newspapers had published at least 12,500 articles about the broadcast and its impact, but the story dropped from the front pages after a few days. Adolf Hitler referenced the broadcast in a speech in Munich on November 8, 1938. Welles later remarked that Hitler cited the effect of the broadcast on the American public as evidence of \"the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy\".\n\nBob Sanders recalled looking outside the window and seeing a traffic jam in the normally quiet Grover's Mill, New Jersey, a crossroads of Cranbury and Clarksville Roads.\n\nLater studies indicate that many missed the repeated notices about the broadcast being fictional, partly because \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", an unsponsored CBS cultural program with a relatively small audience, ran at the same time as the NBC Red Network's popular \"Chase and Sanborn Hour\" featuring ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. At the time, many Americans assumed that a significant number of \"Chase and Sanborn\" listeners changed stations when the first comic sketch ended and a musical number by Nelson Eddy began and then tuned in \"The War of the Worlds\" after the opening announcements, but historian A. Brad Schwartz, after studying hundreds of letters from people who heard \"The War of the Worlds\", as well as contemporary audience surveys, concluded that very few people frightened by Welles's broadcast had tuned out Bergen's program. \"All the hard evidence suggests that \"The Chase & Sanborn Hour\" was only a minor contributing factor to the Martian hysteria,\" he wrote. \"...in truth, there was no mass exodus from Charlie McCarthy to Orson Welles that night.\" Because the broadcast was unsponsored, Welles and company could schedule breaks at will, rather than arranging them around advertisements. As a result, the only notices that the broadcast was fictional came at the start of the broadcast and about 40 and 55 minutes into it.\n\nA study by the Radio Project discovered that fewer than one third of frightened listeners understood the invaders to be aliens; most thought that they were listening to reports of a German invasion or of a natural catastrophe. \"People were on edge\", wrote Welles biographer Frank Brady. \"For the entire month prior to 'The War of the Worlds', radio had kept the American public alert to the ominous happenings throughout the world. The Munich crisis was at its height... For the first time in history, the public could tune into their radios every night and hear, boot by boot, accusation by accusation, threat by threat, the rumblings that seemed inevitably leading to a world war.\"\n\nCBS News chief Paul White wrote that he was convinced that the panic induced by the broadcast was a result of the public suspense generated before the Munich Pact. \"Radio listeners had had their emotions played upon for days... Thus they believed the Welles production even though it was specifically stated that the whole thing was fiction\".\n\n\"The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast. ... Radio had siphoned off advertising revenue from print during the Depression, badly damaging the newspaper industry. So the papers seized the opportunity presented by Welles’ program to discredit radio as a source of news. The newspaper industry sensationalized the panic to prove to advertisers, and regulators, that radio management was irresponsible and not to be trusted.\"\n\nHistorical research suggests the panic was far less widespread than newspapers had indicated at the time. \"[T]he panic and mass hysteria so readily associated with 'The War of the Worlds' did not occur on anything approaching a nationwide dimension\", American University media historian W. Joseph Campbell wrote in 2003. He quotes Robert E. Bartholomew, an authority on mass panic outbreaks, as having said that \"there is a growing consensus among sociologists that the extent of the panic... was greatly exaggerated\".\n\nThat position is supported by contemporary accounts. \"In the first place, most people didn't hear [the show],\" said Frank Stanton, later president of CBS. Of the nearly 2,000 letters mailed to Welles and the Federal Communications Commission after \"The War of the Worlds,\" currently held by the University of Michigan and the National Archives and Records Administration, roughly 27% came from frightened listeners or people who witnessed any panic. After analyzing those letters, A. Brad Schwartz concluded that although the broadcast briefly misled a significant portion of its audience, very few of those listeners fled their homes or otherwise panicked. The total number of protest letters sent to Welles and the FCC is also low in comparison with other controversial radio broadcasts of the period, further suggesting the audience was small and the fright severely limited.\n\nFive thousand households were telephoned that night in a survey conducted by the C. E. Hooper company, the main radio ratings service at the time. Only 2% of the respondents said they were listening to the radio play, and no one stated they were listening to a news broadcast. About 98% of respondents said they were listening to other radio programming (\"The Chase and Sanborn Hour\" was by far the most popular program in that timeslot) or not listening to the radio at all. Further shrinking the potential audience, some CBS network affiliates, including some in large markets such as Boston's WEEI, had pre-empted \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\", in favor of local commercial programming.\n\nBen Gross, radio editor for the \"New York Daily News\", wrote in his 1954 memoir that the streets were nearly deserted as he made his way to the studio for the end of the program. Producer John Houseman reported that the Mercury Theatre staff was surprised when they were finally released from the CBS studios to find life going on as usual in the streets of New York. The writer of a letter that \"The Washington Post\" published later likewise recalled no panicked mobs in the capital's downtown streets at the time. \"The supposed panic was so tiny as to be practically immeasurable on the night of the broadcast\", media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow wrote in \"Slate\" on its 75th anniversary in 2013; \"Almost nobody was fooled\".\n\nAccording to Campbell, the most common response said to indicate a panic was calling the local newspaper or police to confirm the story or seek additional information. That, he writes, is an indicator that people were \"not\" generally panicking or hysterical. \"The call volume perhaps is best understood as an altogether \"rational\" response...\" Some New Jersey media and law enforcement agencies received up to 40% more telephone calls than normal during the broadcast.\n\nAs it was late on a Sunday night in the Eastern Time Zone, where the broadcast originated, few reporters and other staff were present in newsrooms. Most newspaper coverage thus took the form of Associated Press stories, which were largely anecdotal aggregates of reporting from its various bureaus, giving the impression that panic had indeed been widespread. Many newspapers led with the Associated Press's story the next day.\n\nThe \"Twin City Sentinel\" of Winston-Salem, North Carolina pointed out that the situation could have been even worse if most people had not been listening to Edgar Bergen's show: \"Charlie McCarthy last night saved the United States from a sudden and panicky death by hysteria.\"\n\nOn November 2, 1938, the Australian newspaper \"The Age\" characterized the incident as \"mass hysteria\" and stated that \"never in the history of the United States had such a wave of terror and panic swept the continent\". Unnamed observers quoted by \"The Age\" commented that \"the panic could have only happened in America.\"\n\nEditorialists chastised the radio industry for allowing that to happen. The response may have reflected newspaper publishers' fears that radio, to which they had lost some of the advertising revenue that was scarce enough during the Great Depression, would render them obsolete. In \"The War of the Worlds,\" they saw an opportunity to cast aspersions on the newer medium: \"The nation as a whole continues to face the danger of incomplete, misunderstood news over a medium which has yet to prove that it is competent to perform the news job,\" wrote \"Editor & Publisher\", the newspaper industry's trade journal.\n\nWilliam Randolph Hearst's papers called on broadcasters to police themselves, lest the government step in, as Iowa Senator Clyde L. Herring proposed a bill that would have required all programming to be reviewed by the FCC prior to broadcast (he never actually introduced it). Others blamed the radio audience for its credulity. Noting that any intelligent listener would have realized the broadcast was fictional, the \"Chicago Tribune\" opined, \"it would be more tactful to say that some members of the radio audience are a trifle retarded mentally, and that many a program is prepared for their consumption.\" Other newspapers took pains to note that anxious listeners had called \"their\" offices to learn whether Martians were really attacking.\n\nFew contemporary accounts exist outside newspaper coverage of the mass panic and hysteria supposedly induced by the broadcast. Justin Levine, a producer at KFI in Los Angeles, wrote in a 2000 history of the FCC's response to hoax broadcasts that \"the anecdotal nature of such reporting makes it difficult to objectively assess the true extent and intensity of the panic. Bartholomew sees this as yet more evidence that the panic was predominantly a creation of the newspaper industry.\n\nIn a study published in book form as \"The Invasion from Mars\" (1940), Princeton professor Hadley Cantril calculated that some six million people heard \"The War of the Worlds\" broadcast. He estimated that 1.7 million listeners believed the broadcast was an actual news bulletin and, of those, 1.2 million people were frightened or disturbed. Media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow have since concluded, however, that Cantril's study has serious flaws. Its estimate of the program's audience is more than twice as high as any other at the time. Cantril himself conceded that, but argued that unlike Hooper, his estimate had attempted to capture the significant portion of the audience that did not have home telephones at that time. Since those respondents were contacted only after the media frenzy, Cantril allowed that their recollections could have been influenced by what they read in the newspapers. Claims that \"Chase and Sanborn\" listeners, who missed the disclaimer at the beginning when they turned to CBS during a commercial break or musical performance on that show and thus mistook \"The War of the Worlds\" for a real broadcast inflated the show's audience and the ensuing alleged panic, are impossible to substantiate.\n\nApart from his admittedly-imperfect methods of estimating the audience and assessing the authenticity of their response, Pooley and Socolow found, Cantril made another error in typing audience reaction. Respondents had indicated a variety of reactions to the program, among them \"excited\", \"disturbed\", and \"frightened\". However, he included all of them with \"panicked\", failing to account for the possibility that despite their reaction, they were still aware the broadcast was staged. \"[T]hose who did hear it, looked at it as a prank and accepted it that way,\" recalled researcher Frank Stanton.\n\nBartholomew grants that hundreds of thousands were frightened, but calls evidence of people taking action based on their fear \"scant\" and \"anecdotal\". Indeed, contemporary news articles indicate that police were swamped with hundreds of calls in numerous locations, but stories of people doing anything more than calling authorities involved mostly only small groups. Such stories were often reported by people who were panicking themselves.\n\nLater investigations found much of the alleged panicked responses to have been exaggerated or mistaken. Cantril's researchers found that contrary to what had been claimed, no admissions for shock were made at a Newark hospital during the broadcast; hospitals in New York City similarly reported no spike in admissions that night. A few suicide attempts seem to have been prevented when friends or family intervened, but no record of a successful one exists. A \"Washington Post\" claim that a man died of a heart attack brought on by listening to the program could not be verified. One woman filed a lawsuit against CBS, but it was soon dismissed.\n\nThe FCC also received letters from the public that advised against taking reprisals. Singer Eddie Cantor urged the commission not to overreact, as \"censorship would retard radio immeasurably.\" The FCC not only chose not to punish Welles or CBS but also barred complaints about \"The War of the Worlds\" from being brought up during license renewals. \"Janet Jackson's 2004 'wardrobe malfunction' remains far more significant in the history of broadcast regulation than Orson Welles' trickery,\" wrote media historians Jefferson Pooley and Michael Socolow.\n\nH. G. Wells and Orson Welles met for the first and only time in late October 1940, shortly before the second anniversary of the \"Mercury Theatre\" broadcast, when they both happened to be lecturing in San Antonio, Texas. On October 28, 1940, the two men visited the studios of KTSA radio for an interview by Charles C. Shaw, who introduced them by characterizing the panic generated by \"The War of the Worlds\": \"The country at large was frightened almost out of its wits\".\n\nH.G. Wells expressed good-natured skepticism about the actual extent of the panic caused by \"this sensational Halloween spree,\" saying: \"Are you sure there was such a panic in America or wasn't it your Halloween fun?\" Orson Welles appreciated the comment: \"I think that's the nicest thing that a man from England could say about the men from Mars. Mr. Hitler made a good deal of sport of it, you know... It's supposed to show the corrupt condition and decadent state of affairs in democracy, that 'The War of the Worlds' went over as well as it did. I think it's very nice of Mr. Wells to say that not only I didn't mean it, but the American people didn't mean it.\"\n\nWhen Shaw interjected that there was \"some excitement\" that he did not wish to belittle, Welles asked him, \"What \"kind\" of excitement? Mr. H. G. Wells wants to know if the excitement wasn't the same kind of excitement that we extract from a practical joke in which somebody puts a sheet over his head and says 'Boo!' I don't think anybody believes that that individual is a ghost, but we do scream and yell and rush down the hall. And that's just about what happened.\"\n\n\"That's a very excellent description,\" Shaw said.\n\n\"You aren't quite serious in America, yet,\" said Wells. \"You haven't got the war right under your chins. And the consequence is you can still play with ideas of terror and conflict... It's a natural thing to do until you're right up against it.\"\n\n\"Until it ceases to be a game,\" Welles said, a phrase that Wells repeated in agreement.\n\nBritain and France had then been at war with Nazi Germany for more than a year.\n\nAs the Mercury's second theatre season began in 1938, Orson Welles and John Houseman were unable to write the \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" broadcasts on their own. They hired Howard Koch, whose experience in having a play performed by the Federal Theatre Project in Chicago led him to leave his law practice and move to New York to become a writer. Koch was put to work at $50 a week, raised to $60 after he proved himself. \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" was a sustaining show, so in lieu of a more substantial salary, Houseman gave Koch the rights to any script he worked on.\n\nA condensed version of the script for \"The War of the Worlds\" appeared in the debut issue of \"Radio Digest\" magazine (February 1939), in an article on the broadcast that credited \"Orson Welles and his Mercury Theatre players\". The complete script appeared in \"The Invasion from Mars: A Study in the Psychology of Panic\" (1940), the book publication of a Princeton University study directed by psychologist Hadley Cantril. Welles strongly protested Koch being listed as sole author since many others contributed to the script, but by the time the book was published, he had decided to end the dispute.\n\nWelles did seek legal redress after the CBS TV series \"Studio One\" presented its top-rated broadcast, \"The Night America Trembled\", on September 9, 1957. Hosted by Edward R. Murrow, the live presentation of Nelson S. Bond's documentary play recreated the 1938 performance of \"The War of the Worlds\" in the CBS studio, using the script as a framework for a series of factual narratives about a cross-section of radio listeners. No member of the \"Mercury Theatre\" is named. The courts ruled against Welles, who was found to have abandoned any rights to the script after it was published in Cantril's book. Koch had granted CBS the right to use the script in its program.\n\n\"As it developed over the years, Koch took some cash and some credit,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. \"He wrote the story of how he created the adaptation, with a copy of his script being made into a paperback book enjoying large printings and an album of the broadcast selling over 500,000 copies, part of the income also going to him as copyright owner.\" Since his death in 1995, Koch's family has received royalties from adaptations or broadcasts.\n\nThe book, \"The Panic Broadcast\", was first published in 1970. The best-selling album was a sound recording of the broadcast titled \"Orson Welles' War of the Worlds\", \"released by arrangement with Manheim Fox Enterprises, Inc.\" The source discs for the recording are unknown. Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that it was a poor-quality recording taken off the air at the time of broadcast – \"a pirated record which people have made fortunes of money and have no right to play.\" Welles received no compensation.\n\nInitially apologetic about the supposed panic his broadcast had caused (and privately fuming that newspaper reports of lawsuits were either greatly exaggerated or totally fabricated), Welles later embraced the story as part of his personal myth. \"Houses were emptying, churches were filling up; from Nashville to Minneapolis there was wailing in the streets and the rending of garments,\" he told Peter Bogdanovich years later.\n\nCBS, too, found reports ultimately useful in promoting the strength of its influence. It presented a fictionalized account of the panic in \"The Night America Trembled\", a 1957 episode of the television series \"Studio One\", and included it prominently in its 2003 celebrations of CBS's 75th anniversary as a television broadcaster. \"The legend of the panic,\" according to Jefferson and Socolow, \"grew exponentially over the following years ... [It] persists because it so perfectly captures our unease with the media's power over our lives.\"\n\nIn 1975, ABC aired the television movie \"The Night That Panicked America\", depicting the effect the radio drama had on the public using fictional, but typical American families of the time.\nThe New Jersey Township of West Windsor, where Grover's Mill is located, commemorated the 50th anniversary of the broadcast in 1988 with four days of festivities including art and planetarium shows, a panel discussion, a parade, burial of a time capsule, a dinner dance, film festivals devoted to H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, and the dedication of a bronze monument to the fictional Martian landings. Howard Koch, an author of the original radio script, attended the 49th anniversary celebration as an honored guest.\n\nThe 75th anniversary of \"The War of the Worlds\" was marked by an international rebroadcast with an introduction by George Takei, and an episode of the PBS documentary series \"American Experience\".\n\nAdditionally, and perhaps accidentally, this also qualifies as an early alternate reality project, as, aside from the introduction, was played as a real event, with little self awareness and asking the audience to accept what it was presenting as a form of reality.\n\nOn January 27, 2003, the Mercury Theatre broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\" was one of the first 50 recordings made part of the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.\n\nSince the original \"Mercury Theatre on the Air\" broadcast of \"The War of the Worlds\", many re-airings, remakes, re-enactments, parodies, and new dramatizations have occurred. Many American radio stations, particularly those that regularly air old-time radio programs, re-air the original program as a Halloween tradition. Some notable examples include:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8088", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8088", "title": "Documentary film", "text": "Documentary film\n\nA documentary film is a non-fictional, motion picture intended to \"document reality, primarily for the purposes of instruction, education, or maintaining a historical record\". Documentary has been described as \"\"a\" \"filmmaking practice, a cinematic tradition, and mode of audience reception\" \"that is continually evolving and is without clear boundaries\"\". Documentary films were originally called actuality films, and were one minute, or less, in length. Over time, documentaries have evolved to be longer in length, and to include more categories; some examples being: educational, observational, and docufiction. Documentaries are meant to be informative works, and are often used within schools, as a resource to teach various principles.\n\nSocial media platforms, such as YouTube, have provided an avenue for the growth of the documentary film genre; These platforms have increased the distribution area and ease-of-accessibility; thereby, enhancing the ability to educate a larger volume of viewers, and broadening the reach of persons who receive that information.\n\nPolish writer and filmmaker Bolesław Matuszewski was among those who identified the mode of documentary film. He wrote two of the earliest texts on cinema \"Une nouvelle source de l'histoire\" (eng. A New Source of History) and \"La photographie animée\" (eng. Animated photography). Both were published in 1898 in French and among the early written works to consider the historical and documentary value of the film. Matuszewski is also among the first filmmakers to propose the creation of a Film Archive to collect and keep safe visual materials.\n\nIn popular myth, the word \"documentary\" was coined by Scottish documentary filmmaker John Grierson in his review of Robert Flaherty's film \"Moana\" (1926), published in the \"New York Sun\" on 8 February 1926, written by \"The Moviegoer\" (a pen name for Grierson).\n\nGrierson's principles of documentary were that cinema's potential for observing life could be exploited in a new art form; that the \"original\" actor and \"original\" scene are better guides than their fiction counterparts to interpreting the modern world; and that materials \"thus taken from the raw\" can be more real than the acted article. In this regard, Grierson's definition of documentary as \"creative treatment of actuality\" has gained some acceptance, with this position at variance with Soviet film-maker Dziga Vertov's provocation to present \"life as it is\" (that is, life filmed surreptitiously) and \"life caught unawares\" (life provoked or surprised by the camera).\n\nThe American film critic Pare Lorentz defines a documentary film as \"a factual film which is dramatic.\" Others further state that a documentary stands out from the other types of non-fiction films for providing an opinion, and a specific message, along with the facts it presents.\n\nDocumentary practice is the complex process of creating documentary projects. It refers to what people do with media devices, content, form, and production strategies in order to address the creative, ethical, and conceptual problems and choices that arise as they make documentaries.\n\nDocumentary filmmaking can be used as a form of journalism, advocacy, or personal expression.\n\nEarly film (pre-1900) was dominated by the novelty of showing an event. They were single-shot moments captured on film: a train entering a station, a boat docking, or factory workers leaving work. These short films were called \"actuality\" films; the term \"documentary\" was not coined until 1926. Many of the first films, such as those made by Auguste and Louis Lumière, were a minute or less in length, due to technological limitations (example on YouTube).\n\nFilms showing many people (for example, leaving a factory) were often made for commercial reasons: the people being filmed were eager to see, for payment, the film showing them. One notable film clocked in at over an hour and a half, \"The Corbett-Fitzsimmons Fight\". Using pioneering film-looping technology, Enoch J. Rector presented the entirety of a famous 1897 prize-fight on cinema screens across the United States.\n\nIn May 1896, Bolesław Matuszewski recorded on film few surgical operations in Warsaw and Saint Petersburg hospitals. In 1898, French surgeon Eugène-Louis Doyen invited Bolesław Matuszewski and Clément Maurice and proposed them to recorded his surgical operations. They started in Paris a series of surgical films sometime before July 1898. Until 1906, the year of his last film, Doyen recorded more than 60 operations. Doyen said that his first films taught him how to correct professional errors he had been unaware of. For scientific purposes, after 1906, Doyen combined 15 of his films into three compilations, two of which survive, the six-film series \"Extirpation des tumeurs encapsulées\" (1906), and the four-film \"Les Opérations sur la cavité crânienne\" (1911). These and five other of Doyen's films survive.\nBetween July 1898 and 1901, the Romanian professor Gheorghe Marinescu made several science films in his neurology clinic in Bucharest: \"Walking Troubles of Organic Hemiplegy\" (1898), \"The Walking Troubles of Organic Paraplegies\" (1899), \"A Case of Hysteric Hemiplegy Healed Through Hypnosis\" (1899), \"The Walking Troubles of Progressive Locomotion Ataxy\" (1900), and \"Illnesses of the Muscles\" (1901). All these short films have been preserved. The professor called his works \"studies with the help of the cinematograph,\" and published the results, along with several consecutive frames, in issues of \"La Semaine Médicale\" magazine from Paris, between 1899 and 1902. In 1924, Auguste Lumiere recognized the merits of Marinescu's science films: \"I've seen your scientific reports about the usage of the cinematograph in studies of nervous illnesses, when I was still receiving \"La Semaine Médicale,\" but back then I had other concerns, which left me no spare time to begin biological studies. I must say I forgot those works and I am thankful to you that you reminded them to me. Unfortunately, not many scientists have followed your way.\"\n\nTravelogue films were very popular in the early part of the 20th century. They were often referred to by distributors as \"scenics.\" Scenics were among the most popular sort of films at the time. An important early film to move beyond the concept of the scenic was \"In the Land of the Head Hunters\" (1914), which embraced primitivism and exoticism in a staged story presented as truthful re-enactments of the life of Native Americans.\n\nContemplation is a separate area. Pathé is the best-known global manufacturer of such films of the early 20th century. A vivid example is \"Moscow Clad in Snow\" (1909).\n\nBiographical documentaries appeared during this time, such as the feature \"Eminescu-Veronica-Creangă\" (1914) on the relationship between the writers Mihai Eminescu, Veronica Micle and Ion Creangă (all deceased at the time of the production) released by the Bucharest chapter of Pathé.\n\nEarly color motion picture processes such as Kinemacolor—known for the feature \"With Our King and Queen Through India\" (1912)—and Prizmacolor—known for \"Everywhere With Prizma\" (1919) and the five-reel feature \"Bali the Unknown\" (1921)—used travelogues to promote the new color processes. In contrast, Technicolor concentrated primarily on getting their process adopted by Hollywood studios for fictional feature films.\n\nAlso during this period, Frank Hurley's feature documentary film, \"South\" (1919), about the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition was released. The film documented the failed Antarctic expedition led by Ernest Shackleton in 1914.\n\nWith Robert J. Flaherty's \"Nanook of the North\" in 1922, documentary film embraced romanticism; Flaherty filmed a number of heavily staged romantic films during this time period, often showing how his subjects would have lived 100 years earlier and not how they lived right then. For instance, in \"Nanook of the North\", Flaherty did not allow his subjects to shoot a walrus with a nearby shotgun, but had them use a harpoon instead. Some of Flaherty's staging, such as building a roofless igloo for interior shots, was done to accommodate the filming technology of the time.\n\nParamount Pictures tried to repeat the success of Flaherty's \"Nanook\" and \"Moana\" with two romanticized documentaries, \"Grass\" (1925) and \"Chang\" (1927), both directed by Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack.\n\nThe city-symphony film genre were avant-garde films during the 1920s and 1930s. These films were, particularly influenced by, modern art; namely Cubism, Constructivism, and Impressionism (\"See: A. L. Rees, 2011\"). According to, art historian and author Scott Macdonald (\"See: Film Quarterly, 2010\"), city-symphony films can be described as, \"An intersection between, documentary and avant-garde film: an avant-doc\"; However, A.L. Rees suggests, to see them as avant-garde films (\"See: A. L. Rees, 2011: pp. 35\").\n\nEarly titles produced within this genre include: Manhatta (New York; dir. Paul Strand, 1921); Rien Que Les Heures/Nothing But The Hours (France; dir. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1926); Twenty-Four Dollar Island (dir. Robert Flaherty, 1927); Études sur Paris (dir. André Sauvage, 1928); The Bridge (1928) and Rain (1929), both by Joris Ivens; São Paulo, Sinfonia da Metrópole/São Paulo, A Metropolis Symphony (dir. Adalberto Kemeny, 1929), \"\" (dir. Walter Ruttmann, 1927); and \"The Man with a Movie Camera\" (dir. Dziga Vertov, 1929).\nA city-symphony film, as the name suggests, is most often based around a major metropolitan city area and seeks to capture the life, events and activities of the city. It can be abstract cinematography (\"See:\" Walter Ruttman's\", Berlin\") or may utilize Russian Montage theory (\"See:\" Dziga Vertov's, \"Man with a Movie Camera\"); yet, most importantly, a city-symphony film is a form of cinepoetry being shot and edited in the style of a \"symphony\". \nThe continental tradition (\"See:\" Realism), focused on humans within human-made environments, and included the so-called \"city-symphony\" films such as Walter Ruttmann's, \"Berlin, Symphony of a City\" (of which Grierson noted in an article that \"Berlin,\" represented what a documentary should not be); Alberto Cavalcanti's, \"Rien que les heures;\" and Dziga Vertov's \"Man with a Movie Camera\". These films tend to feature \"people as products of their environment\", and lean towards the \"avant-garde\".\n\nDziga Vertov was central to the Soviet \"Kino-Pravda\" (literally, \"cinematic truth\") newsreel series of the 1920s. Vertov believed the camera—with its varied lenses, shot-counter shot editing, time-lapse, ability to slow motion, stop motion and fast-motion—could render reality more accurately than the human eye, and made a film philosophy out of it.\n\nThe newsreel tradition is important in documentary film; newsreels were also sometimes staged but were usually re-enactments of events that had already happened, not attempts to steer events as they were in the process of happening. For instance, much of the battle footage from the early 20th century was staged; the cameramen would usually arrive on site after a major battle and re-enact scenes to film them.\n\nThe propagandist tradition consists of films made with the explicit purpose of persuading an audience of a point. One of the most celebrated and controversial propaganda films is Leni Riefenstahl's film \"Triumph of the Will\" (1935), which chronicled the 1934 Nazi Party Congress and was commissioned by Adolf Hitler. Leftist filmmakers Joris Ivens and Henri Storck directed \"Borinage\" (1931) about the Belgian coal mining region. Luis Buñuel directed a \"surrealist\" documentary \"Las Hurdes\" (1933).\n\nPare Lorentz's \"The Plow That Broke the Plains\" (1936) and \"The River\" (1938) and Willard Van Dyke's \"The City\" (1939) are notable New Deal productions, each presenting complex combinations of social and ecological awareness, government propaganda, and leftist viewpoints. Frank Capra's \"Why We Fight\" (1942–1944) series was a newsreel series in the United States, commissioned by the government to convince the U.S. public that it was time to go to war. Constance Bennett and her husband Henri de la Falaise produced two feature-length documentaries, \"\" (1935) filmed in Bali, and \"Kilou the Killer Tiger\" (1936) filmed in Indochina.\n\nIn Canada, the Film Board, set up by John Grierson, was created for the same propaganda reasons. It also created newsreels that were seen by their national governments as legitimate counter-propaganda to the psychological warfare of Nazi Germany (orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels).\nIn Britain, a number of different filmmakers came together under John Grierson. They became known as the Documentary Film Movement. Grierson, Alberto Cavalcanti, Harry Watt, Basil Wright, and Humphrey Jennings amongst others succeeded in blending propaganda, information, and education with a more poetic aesthetic approach to documentary. Examples of their work include \"Drifters\" (John Grierson), \"Song of Ceylon\" (Basil Wright), \"Fires Were Started\", and \"A Diary for Timothy\" (Humphrey Jennings). Their work involved poets such as W. H. Auden, composers such as Benjamin Britten, and writers such as J. B. Priestley. Among the best known films of the movement are \"Night Mail\" and \"Coal Face\".\n\nFilm \"Calling mr. Smith\" (1943) was anti-nazi color film created by Stefan Themerson and being both documentary and avant-garde film against war. It was one of the first anti-nazi films in history.\n\nCinéma vérité (or the closely related direct cinema) was dependent on some technical advances in order to exist: light, quiet and reliable cameras, and portable sync sound.\n\nCinéma vérité and similar documentary traditions can thus be seen, in a broader perspective, as a reaction against studio-based film production constraints. Shooting on location, with smaller crews, would also happen in the French New Wave, the filmmakers taking advantage of advances in technology allowing smaller, handheld cameras and synchronized sound to film events on location as they unfolded.\n\nAlthough the terms are sometimes used interchangeably, there are important differences between cinéma vérité (Jean Rouch) and the North American \"Direct Cinema\" (or more accurately \"\"), pioneered by, among others, Canadians Allan King, , and Pierre Perrault, and Americans Robert Drew, Richard Leacock, Frederick Wiseman, and Albert and David Maysles.\n\nThe directors of the movement take different viewpoints on their degree of involvement with their subjects. Kopple and Pennebaker, for instance, choose non-involvement (or at least no overt involvement), and Perrault, Rouch, Koenig, and Kroitor favor direct involvement or even provocation when they deem it necessary.\n\nThe films \"Chronicle of a Summer\" (Jean Rouch), \"Dont Look Back\" (D. A. Pennebaker), \"Grey Gardens\" (Albert and David Maysles), \"Titicut Follies\" (Frederick Wiseman), \"Primary\" and \"\" (both produced by Robert Drew), \"Harlan County, USA\" (directed by Barbara Kopple), \"Lonely Boy\" (Wolf Koenig and Roman Kroitor) are all frequently deemed cinéma vérité films.\n\nThe fundamentals of the style include following a person during a crisis with a moving, often handheld, camera to capture more personal reactions. There are no sit-down interviews, and the shooting ratio (the amount of film shot to the finished product) is very high, often reaching 80 to one. From there, editors find and sculpt the work into a film. The editors of the movement—such as Werner Nold, Charlotte Zwerin, Muffie Myers, Susan Froemke, and Ellen Hovde—are often overlooked, but their input to the films was so vital that they were often given co-director credits.\n\nFamous cinéma vérité/direct cinema films include \"Les Raquetteurs\", \"Showman\", \"Salesman\", \"Near Death\", and \"The Children Were Watching\".\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, documentary film was often conceived as a political weapon against neocolonialism and capitalism in general, especially in Latin America, but also in a changing Quebec society. \"La Hora de los hornos\" (\"The Hour of the Furnaces\", from 1968), directed by Octavio Getino and Arnold Vincent Kudales Sr., influenced a whole generation of filmmakers. Among the many political documentaries produced in the early 1970s was \"Chile: A Special Report,\" public television's first in-depth expository look of the September 1973 overthrow of the Salvador Allende government in Chile by military leaders under Augusto Pinochet, produced by documentarians Ari Martinez and José Garcia.\n\nBox office analysts have noted that this film genre has become increasingly successful in theatrical release with films such as \"Fahrenheit 9/11\", \"Super Size Me\", \"Food, Inc.\", \"Earth\", \"March of the Penguins\", \"Religulous\", and \"An Inconvenient Truth\" among the most prominent examples. Compared to dramatic narrative films, documentaries typically have far lower budgets which makes them attractive to film companies because even a limited theatrical release can be highly profitable.\n\nThe nature of documentary films has expanded in the past 20 years from the cinema verité style introduced in the 1960s in which the use of portable camera and sound equipment allowed an intimate relationship between filmmaker and subject. The line blurs between documentary and narrative and some works are very personal, such as the late Marlon Riggs's \"Tongues Untied\" (1989) and \"Black Is...Black Ain't\" (1995), which mix expressive, poetic, and rhetorical elements and stresses subjectivities rather than historical materials.\n\nHistorical documentaries, such as the landmark 14-hour \"Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years\" (1986—Part 1 and 1989—Part 2) by Henry Hampton, \"4 Little Girls\" (1997) by Spike Lee, and \"The Civil War\" by Ken Burns, UNESCO awarded independent film on slavery 500 Years Later, expressed not only a distinctive voice but also a perspective and point of views. Some films such as \"The Thin Blue Line\" by Errol Morris incorporated stylized re-enactments, and Michael Moore's \"Roger & Me\" placed far more interpretive control with the director. The commercial success of these documentaries may derive from this narrative shift in the documentary form, leading some critics to question whether such films can truly be called documentaries; critics sometimes refer to these works as \"mondo films\" or \"docu-ganda.\" However, directorial manipulation of documentary subjects has been noted since the work of Flaherty, and may be endemic to the form due to problematic ontological foundations.\n\nDocumentary filmmakers are increasingly utilizing social impact campaigns with their films. Social impact campaigns seek to leverage media projects by converting public awareness of social issues and causes into engagement and action, largely by offering the audience a way to get involved. Examples of such documentaries include \"Kony 2012\", \"Salam Neighbor, Gasland\", \"Living on One Dollar\", and \"Girl Rising\".\n\nAlthough documentaries are financially more viable with the increasing popularity of the genre and the advent of the DVD, funding for documentary film production remains elusive. Within the past decade, the largest exhibition opportunities have emerged from within the broadcast market, making filmmakers beholden to the tastes and influences of the broadcasters who have become their largest funding source.\n\nModern documentaries have some overlap with television forms, with the development of \"reality television\" that occasionally verges on the documentary but more often veers to the fictional or staged. The \"making-of\" documentary shows how a movie or a computer game was produced. Usually made for promotional purposes, it is closer to an advertisement than a classic documentary.\n\nModern lightweight digital video cameras and computer-based editing have greatly aided documentary makers, as has the dramatic drop in equipment prices. The first film to take full advantage of this change was Martin Kunert and Eric Manes' \"Voices of Iraq\", where 150 DV cameras were sent to Iraq during the war and passed out to Iraqis to record themselves.\n\nFilms in the documentary form without words have been made. Listen to Britain directed by Humphrey Jennings and Stuart McAllister in 1942 is a wordless meditation on wartime Britain. From 1982, the Qatsi trilogy and the similar \"Baraka\" could be described as visual tone poems, with music related to the images, but no spoken content. \"Koyaanisqatsi\" (part of the Qatsi trilogy) consists primarily of slow motion and time-lapse photography of cities and many natural landscapes across the United States. \"Baraka\" tries to capture the great pulse of humanity as it flocks and swarms in daily activity and religious ceremonies.\n\n\"Bodysong\" was made in 2003 and won a British Independent Film Award for \"Best British Documentary.\"\n\nThe 2004 film \"Genesis\" shows animal and plant life in states of expansion, decay, sex, and death, with some, but little, narration.\n\nThe traditional style for narration is to have a dedicated narrator read a script which is dubbed onto the audio track. The narrator never appears on camera and may not necessarily have knowledge of the subject matter or involvement in the writing of the script.\nThis style of narration uses title screens to visually narrate the documentary. The screens are held for about 5–10 seconds to allow adequate time for the viewer to read them. They are similar to the ones shown at the end of movies based on true stories, but they are shown throughout, typically between scenes.\nIn this style, there is a host who appears on camera, conducts interviews, and who also does voice-overs.\n\nDocufiction is a hybrid genre from two basic ones, fiction film and documentary, practiced since the first documentary films were made.\n\nFake-fiction is a genre which deliberately presents real, unscripted events in the form of a fiction film, making them appear as staged. The concept was introduced by Pierre Bismuth to describe his 2016 film \"Where is Rocky II?\"\n\nA DVD documentary is a documentary film of indeterminate length that has been produced with the sole intent of releasing it for direct sale to the public on DVD(s), as different from a documentary being made and released first on television or on a cinema screen (a.k.a. theatrical release) and subsequently on DVD for public consumption.\n\nThis form of documentary release is becoming more popular and accepted as costs and difficulty with finding TV or theatrical release slots increases. It is also commonly used for more \"specialist\" documentaries, which might not have general interest to a wider TV audience. Examples are military, cultural arts, transport, sports, etc.\n\nCompilation films were pioneered in 1927 by Esfir Schub with \"The Fall of the Romanov Dynasty\". More recent examples include \"Point of Order\" (1964), directed by Emile de Antonio about the McCarthy hearings. Similarly, \"The Last Cigarette\" combines the testimony of various tobacco company executives before the U.S. Congress with archival propaganda extolling the virtues of smoking.\n\nPoetic documentaries, which first appeared in the 1920s, were a sort of reaction against both the content and the rapidly crystallizing grammar of the early fiction film. The poetic mode moved away from continuity editing and instead organized images of the material world by means of associations and patterns, both in terms of time and space. Well-rounded characters—\"lifelike people\"—were absent; instead, people appeared in these films as entities, just like any other, that are found in the material world. The films were fragmentary, impressionistic, lyrical. Their disruption of the coherence of time and space—a coherence favored by the fiction films of the day—can also be seen as an element of the modernist counter-model of cinematic narrative. The \"real world\"—Nichols calls it the \"historical world\"—was broken up into fragments and aesthetically reconstituted using film form. Examples of this style include Joris Ivens' \"Rain\" (1928), which records a passing summer shower over Amsterdam; László Moholy-Nagy's \"Play of Light: Black, White, Grey (1930)\", in which he films one of his own kinetic sculptures, emphasizing not the sculpture itself but the play of light around it; Oskar Fischinger's abstract animated films; Francis Thompson's \"N.Y., N.Y.\" (1957), a city symphony film; and Chris Marker's \"Sans Soleil\" (1982).\n\nExpository documentaries speak directly to the viewer, often in the form of an authoritative commentary employing voiceover or titles, proposing a strong argument and point of view. These films are rhetorical, and try to persuade the viewer. (They may use a rich and sonorous male voice.) The (voice-of-God) commentary often sounds \"objective\" and omniscient. Images are often not paramount; they exist to advance the argument. The rhetoric insistently presses upon us to read the images in a certain fashion. Historical documentaries in this mode deliver an unproblematic and \"objective\" account and interpretation of past events.\n\nExamples: TV shows and films like \"Biography\", \"America's Most Wanted\", many science and nature documentaries, Ken Burns' \"The Civil War\" (1990), Robert Hughes' \"The Shock of the New\" (1980), John Berger's \"Ways Of Seeing\" (1974), Frank Capra's wartime \"Why We Fight\" series, and Pare Lorentz's \"The Plow That Broke The Plains\" (1936).\n\nObservational documentaries attempt to simply and spontaneously observe lived life with a minimum of intervention. Filmmakers who worked in this subgenre often saw the poetic mode as too abstract and the expository mode as too didactic. The first observational docs date back to the 1960s; the technological developments which made them possible include mobile lightweight cameras and portable sound recording equipment for synchronized sound. Often, this mode of film eschewed voice-over commentary, post-synchronized dialogue and music, or re-enactments. The films aimed for immediacy, intimacy, and revelation of individual human character in ordinary life situations.\n\nParticipatory documentaries believe that it is impossible for the act of filmmaking to not influence or alter the events being filmed. What these films do is emulate the approach of the anthropologist: participant-observation. Not only is the filmmaker part of the film, we also get a sense of how situations in the film are affected or altered by their presence. Nichols: \"The filmmaker steps out from behind the cloak of voice-over commentary, steps away from poetic meditation, steps down from a fly-on-the-wall perch, and becomes a social actor (almost) like any other. (Almost like any other because the filmmaker retains the camera, and with it, a certain degree of potential power and control over events.)\" The encounter between filmmaker and subject becomes a critical element of the film. Rouch and Morin named the approach cinéma vérité, translating Dziga Vertov's kinopravda into French; the \"truth\" refers to the truth of the encounter rather than some absolute truth.\n\nReflexive documentaries do not see themselves as a transparent window on the world; instead, they draw attention to their own constructedness, and the fact that they are representations. How does the world get represented by documentary films? This question is central to this subgenre of films. They prompt us to \"question the authenticity of documentary in general.\" It is the most self-conscious of all the modes, and is highly skeptical of \"realism\". It may use Brechtian alienation strategies to jar us, in order to \"defamiliarize\" what we are seeing and how we are seeing it.\n\nPerformative documentaries stress subjective experience and emotional response to the world. They are strongly personal, unconventional, perhaps poetic and/or experimental, and might include hypothetical enactments of events designed to make us experience what it might be like for us to possess a certain specific perspective on the world that is not our own, e.g. that of black, gay men in Marlon Riggs's \"Tongues Untied\" (1989) or Jenny Livingston's \"Paris Is Burning\" (1991). This subgenre might also lend itself to certain groups (e.g. women, ethnic minorities, gays and lesbians, etc.) to \"speak about themselves\". Often, a battery of techniques, many borrowed from fiction or avant-garde films, are used. Performative docs often link up personal accounts or experiences with larger political or historical realities.\n\nDocumentaries are shown in schools around the world in order to educate students. Used to introduce various topics to children, they are often used with a school lesson or shown many times to reinforce an idea.\n\nThere are several challenges associated with translation of documentaries. The main two are working conditions and problems with terminology.\n\nDocumentary translators very often have to meet tight deadlines. Normally, the translator has between five and seven days to hand over the translation of a 90-minute programme. Dubbing studios typically give translators a week to translate a documentary, but in order to earn a good salary, translators have to deliver their translations in a much shorter period, usually when the studio decides to deliver the final programme to the client sooner or when the broadcasting channel sets a tight deadline, e.g. on documentaries discussing the latest news.\n\nAnother problem is the lack of postproduction script or the poor quality of the transcription. A correct transcription is essential for a translator to do their work properly, however many times the script is not even given to the translator, which is a major impediment since documentaries are characterised by \"the abundance of terminological units and very specific proper names\". When the script is given to the translator, it is usually poorly transcribed or outright incorrect making the translation unnecessarily difficult and demanding because all of the proper names and specific terminology have to be correct in a documentary programme in order for it to be a reliable source of information, hence the translator has to check every term on their own. Such mistakes in proper names are for instance: \"Jungle Reinhard instead of Django Reinhart, Jorn Asten instead of Jane Austen, and Magnus Axle instead of Aldous Huxley\".\n\nThe process of translation of a documentary programme requires working with very specific, often scientific terminology. Documentary translators usually are not specialist in a given field. Therefore, they are compelled to undertake extensive research whenever asked to make a translation of a specific documentary programme in order to understand it correctly and deliver the final product free of mistakes and inaccuracies. Generally, documentaries contain a large amount of specific terms, with which translators have to familiarise themselves on their own, for example:\nThe documentary \"Beetles, Record Breakers\" makes use of 15 different terms to refer to beetles in less than 30 minutes (longhorn beetle, cellar beetle, stag beetle, burying beetle or gravediggers, sexton beetle, tiger beetle, bloody nose beetle, tortoise beetle, diving beetle, devil’s coach horse, weevil, click beetle, malachite beetle, oil beetle, cockchafer), apart from mentioning other animals such as horseshoe bats or meadow brown butterflies.\nThis poses a real challenge for the translators because they have to render the meaning, i.e. find an equivalent, of a very specific, scientific term in the target language and frequently the narrator uses a more general name instead of a specific term and the translator has to rely on the image presented in the programme to understand which term is being discussed in order to transpose it in the target language accordingly. Additionally, translators of minorised languages often have to face another problem: some terms may not even exist in the target language. In such case, they have to create new terminology or consult specialists to find proper solutions. Also, sometimes the official nomenclature differs from the terminology used by actual specialists, which leaves the translator to decide between using the official vocabulary that can be found in the dictionary, or rather opting for spontaneous expressions used by real experts in real life situations.\n\n"}

PSM broadcasters are often established by law but are non-partisan, independent and run for the benefit of society as a whole.\n\nEBU Members come from as far north as Iceland and as far south as Egypt, from Ireland in the west and Azerbaijan in the east, and almost every nation from geographical Europe in between. Associate Members are from countries and territories beyond Europe, such as Canada, Japan, Mexico, India and China. Associate Members from the United States include ABC, CBS, NBC, CPB, NPR, APM and the only individual station, Chicago-based classical music radio WFMT.\n\nMembership is for media organisations whose countries are within the European Broadcasting Area (EBA), as defined by the International Telecommunication Union, or who are members of the Council of Europe.\n\nMembers benefit from:\n\nThe EBU's highest-profile production is the Eurovision Song Contest. The EBU also organises the Eurovision Dance Contest, the Junior Eurovision Song Contest, the Eurovision Young Dancers competition, and other competitions which are modeled along similar lines.\n\nRadio collaborations include Euroclassic Notturno – an overnight classical music stream, produced by BBC Radio 3 and broadcast in the United Kingdom as \"Through the Night\" – and special theme days, such as the annual Christmas music relays from around Europe. The EBU is a member of the International Music Council.\n\nMost EBU broadcasters have group deals to carry major sporting events including the FIFA World Cup and the inaugural European Championships. Another annually recurring event which is broadcast across Europe through the EBU is the Vienna New Year's Concert.\n\nEurovision Media Services is the business arm of the EBU and provides first-class media services for many media organisations and sports federations around the world.\n\nThe theme music played before EBU broadcasts are Marc-Antoine Charpentier's \"Prelude to Te Deum\". It is well known to Europeans as it is played before and after the Eurovision Song Contest and other important events.\n\nThe EBU was a successor to the International Broadcasting Union (IBU) that was founded in 1925 and had its administrative headquarters in Geneva and technical office in Brussels. It fostered programming exchanges between members and mediated technical disputes between members that were mostly concerned with frequency and interference issues. It was in effect taken over by Nazi Germany during the Second World War and when the conflict ended in the eyes of the Allies it was a compromised organisation that they could not trust.\n\nIn the spring of 1946, representatives of the Soviet radio committee proposed forming a new organisation; however, at the same time preparations were being made for an inter-governmental “European Broadcasting Conference” (EBC) in Copenhagen in 1948 to draw up a new plan for frequency use in the European Broadcasting Area (EBA). It was considered necessary to have an organisation that could implement the “Copenhagen Wavelength Plan” but there was disagreement among broadcasters and particularly a fear expressed by the BBC that a new association might be dominated by the USSR and its proposal to give each of its constituent states one vote. France proposed that it would have four votes with the inclusion of its North African colonies. The United Kingdom felt it would have little influence with just one vote.\n\nOn 27 June 1946, the alternative International Broadcasting Organisation (IBO) was founded with 26 members and without British participation. The following day the IBU met in General Assembly and an attempt was made to dissolve it but failed; though 18 of its 28 members left to join the IBO. For a period of time in the late 1940s both the IBU and IBO vied for the role of organising frequencies but Britain decided to be in involved in neither. The BBC attempted but failed to find suitable working arrangements with them. However, for practical purposes, the IBO rented the IBU technical centre in Brussels and employed its staff. The BBC then proposed a new solution based on the IBO changing its constitution so there will be only one member per ITU country, thus ensuring a Western majority over the USSR and its satellite states. In August 1949 a meeting took place in Stresa, Italy but it resulted in disagreement between delegates on how to resolve the problems. One proposal was for the European Broadcasting Area to be replaced by one that would exclude Eastern Europe, the Levant and North Africa.\n\nAfter Stresa, a consensus emerged among the Western Europeans to form a new organisation and the BBC proposed it be based in London. Meetings in Paris on 31 October and 1 November 1949 sealed the fate of the IBU and IBO, but it was decided not to allow West Germany to be a founder of the new organisation. On 13 February 1950 the European Broadcasting Union had its first meeting with 23 members from the ITU defined European Broadcasting Area at the Imperial Hotel in Torquay, England, United Kingdom. The first president was Ian Jacob of the BBC who remained at the helm for 10 years while its operation was largely dominated by the BBC due to its financial, technical and staff input. The most important difference between the EBU and its predecessors was that EBU membership was for broadcasters and not governments. Early delegates said EBU meetings were cordial and professional and very different from the abrupt tone of its predecessors. West Germany was admitted in 1951 and a working relationship forged with the USSR’s Organisation for International Radio and TV (OIRT) which existed in parallel with the EBU until its merger in 1993. (Source: Diffusion, Journal of the EBU, ‘50 years of the EBU’, Winter 1999/2000).\n\nIn 1967, the first concert in the International Concert Season of the European Broadcasting Union was broadcast from the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London.\n\nThe objective of the EBU's technical activities is simply to assist EBU Members (see below) in this period of unprecedented technological changes. This includes the provision of technical information to Members via conferences and workshops, as well as in written form (such as the EBU Technical Review, and the EBU tech-\"i\" magazine).\n\nThe EBU also encourages active collaboration between its Members on the basis that they can freely share their knowledge and experience, thus achieving considerably more than individual Members could achieve by themselves. Much of this collaboration is achieved through Project Groups which study specific technical issues of common interest: for example, EBU Members have long been preparing for the revision of the 1961 Stockholm Plan.\n\nThe EBU places great emphasis on the use of open standards. Widespread use of open standards (such as MPEG-2, DAB, DVB, etc.) ensures interoperability between products from different vendors, as well as facilitating the exchange of programme material between EBU Members and promoting \"horizontal markets\" for the benefit of all consumers.\n\nEBU Members and the EBU Technical Department have long played an important role in the development of many systems used in radio and television broadcasting, such as:\n\nThe EBU has also actively encouraged the development and implementation of:\n\n\nOn 11 June 2013, the Greek government shut down the state broadcaster ERT, at short notice, citing government spending concerns related to the Euro crisis. In response, the European Broadcasting Union set up a makeshift studio on the same day, near the former ERT offices in Athens, in order to continue providing EBU members with the news-gathering and broadcast relay services which had formerly been provided by ERT.\n\nThe EBU put out a statement expressing its \"profound dismay\" at the shutdown, urged the Greek Prime Minister \"to use all his powers to immediately reverse this decision\" and offered the \"advice, assistance and expertise necessary for ERT to be preserved\".\n\nStarting on 4 May 2014, the New Hellenic Radio, Internet and Television broadcaster began nationwide transmissions, taking over ERT's vacant active membership slot in the EBU. On 11 June 2015, two years after ERT's closure, NERIT SA renamed as ERT SA which reopened with a comprehensive program in all radio stations (with nineteen regional, two world-range and five pan-Hellenic range radio stations) and four TV channels ERT1, ERT2, ERT3 and ERT HD (now ERT Sports HD).\n\nThe Member list , comprises the following 72 broadcasting companies from 56 countries.\n\nAny group or organisation from an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) member country, which provides a radio or television service outside of the European Broadcasting Area, are permitted to submit applications to the EBU for Associate Membership. Countries which have this status also pay an annual fee to maintain this status.\n\nIt was also noted by the EBU that any country that is granted Associate Member status does not include any access into the Eurovision events (with the exceptions of Australia, who have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest and the Junior Eurovision Song Contest since 2015, Canada in Eurovision Young Dancers between 1987 and 1989 and Kazakhstan, who have participated in Junior Eurovision since 2018).\n\nThe list of Associate Members of EBU comprised the following 34 broadcasting companies from 21 countries .\n\nAny groups or organisations from a country with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) membership, which does not qualify for either the EBU's Active or Associate memberships, but still provide a broadcasting activity for the EBU, are granted a unique Approved Participants membership, which lasts approximately five years. An application for this status may be submitted to the EBU at any given time, providing an annual fee is paid.\n\nThe following seven EBU broadcast members had status as Approved Participants in May 2016.\n\nThe EBU in co-operation with the respective host broadcaster organises competitions and events in which its members can participate if they wish to do so. These include:\n\nThe Eurovision Song Contest () is an annual international song competition between EBU Members, that was first held in Lugano, Switzerland, on 24 May 1956. Seven countries participated – each submitting two songs, for a total of 14. This was the only contest in which more than one song per country was performed: since 1957 all contests have allowed one entry per country. The 1956 contest was won by the host nation, Switzerland. The most recent host city was Tel Aviv, Israel, where the Netherlands won the competition.\n\nLet the Peoples Sing is a biennial choir competition, the participants of which are chosen from radio recordings entered by EBU radio members. The final, encompassing three categories and around ten choirs, is offered as a live broadcast to all EBU members. The overall winner is awarded the \"Silver Rose Bowl\".\n\nJeux Sans Frontières (, or Games Without Borders) was a Europe-wide television game show. In its original conception, it was broadcast from 1965 to 1999 under the auspices of the EBU. The original series run ended in 1982 but was revived in 1988 with a different complexion of nations and was hosted by smaller broadcasters.\n\nEurovision Young Musicians is a competition for European musicians that are between the ages of 12 and 21 years old. It is organised by the EBU and is a member of EMCY. The first competition was held in Manchester, the United Kingdom on 11 May 1982.\n\nThe televised competition is held every two years, with some countries holding national heats. Since its foundation in 1982, the Eurovision Young Musicians competition has become one of the most important music competitions on an international level.\n\nThe Eurovision Young Dancers is a biennial dance showcase broadcast on television throughout Europe. The first competition was held in Reggio Emilia, Italy on 16 June 1985.\n\nIt uses a format similar to the Eurovision Song Contest, every country that is a member of the EBU has had the opportunity to send a dance act to compete for the title of \"Eurovision Young Dancer\". The competition is for solo dancers and all contestants must be between the ages of 16 and 21 years and not professionally engaged.\n\nEuroclassic Notturno is a six-hour sequence of classical music recordings assembled by BBC Radio from material supplied by members of the EBU and streamed back to those broadcasters by satellite for use in their overnight classical-music schedules. The recordings used are taken not from commercial CDs but from earlier (usually live) radio broadcasts.\n\nJunior Eurovision Song Contest (), is an annual international song competition, that was first held in Copenhagen, Denmark, on 15 November 2003. Sixteen countries participated – each submitting one song, for a total of 16 entries. The 2003 Contest was won by Croatia and the current winner is Poland.\n\nThe Eurovision Dance Contest (not to be confused with the \"Eurovision Young Dancers Competition\") was an international dancing competition that was held for the first time in London, the United Kingdom on 1 September 2007. The competition was repeated in 2008 when it was held in Glasgow, United Kingdom, but has not been held since.\n\nThe Eurovision Magic Circus Show was an entertainment show organised by the EBU, which took place in 2010, 2011 and 2012 in Geneva. Children aged between 7-14 representing 8 countries within the EBU membership area, performed a variety of circus acts at the \"Geneva Christmas Circus\" (). The main show was also accompanied by the \"Magic Circus Show Orchestra\".\n\nThe inaugural Eurovision Choir featuring non-professional choirs selected by EBU Members, took place on 22 July 2017 in Riga, hosted by the Latvian broadcaster Latvijas Televīzija (LTV). 9 countries took part in the first edition. Carmen Manet from Slovenia was the first winner.\n\nThe European Sports Championships is a multi-sport event involving some of the leading sports in Europe. The European Governing Bodies for athletics, aquatics, cycling, rowing, golf, gymnastics and triathlon, will coordinate their individual championships as part of the first edition in the summer of 2018, hosted by the cities of Berlin (already chosen as the host for the 2018 European Athletics Championships) and Glasgow (already chosen as the host for the 2018 European Aquatics Championships, and which will now also host the events of the other sports).\n\n"}
{"id": "151921", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=151921", "title": "Emmy Award", "text": "Emmy Award\n\nAn Emmy Award, or simply Emmy, is an American award that recognizes excellence in the television industry. It is presented at numerous annual events held throughout the calendar year, each honoring one of the various sectors of the television industry. The two ceremonies that receive the most media coverage are the Primetime Emmy Awards and the Daytime Emmy Awards, which recognize outstanding work in American primetime and daytime entertainment programming, respectively. Other notable Emmy events include those honoring national sports programming, national news and documentary shows, and technological and engineering achievements in television, including the Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards. Regional Emmy Awards are also presented throughout the country at various times through the year, recognizing excellence in local and statewide television. In addition, the International Emmy Awards honor excellence in TV programming produced and initially aired outside the United States.\n\nThe Emmy is named after \"immy\", an informal term for the image orthicon tube that was common in early television cameras. The statuette depicts a winged woman holding an atom. The Emmy is considered one of the four major American entertainment awards, the others being the Grammy (for music), the Oscar (for film), and the Tony (for theater).\n\nThree related, but separate, organizations present the Emmy Award: the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS), the National Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (NATAS), and the International Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (IATAS). The ATAS first awarded the Emmy in 1949 to honor shows produced in the Los Angeles area before it became a national event in the 1950s to honor programs aired nationwide. Over the next two decades, the ATAS, the NATAS, and the IATAS expanded the award to honor other areas of the TV industry, with each organization responsible for administering a particular set of Emmy competitions.\n\nThe Los Angeles–based Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) established the Emmy Award as part of an image-building and public relations opportunity. The first Emmy ceremony took place on January 25, 1949, at the Hollywood Athletic Club, but solely to honor shows produced and aired locally in the Los Angeles area. Shirley Dinsdale has the distinction of receiving the very first Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality, during that first awards ceremony. The term \"Emmy\" is a French alteration of the television crew slang term \"Immy\", the nickname for an \"image orthicon\", a camera tube used in TV production.\n\nIn the 1950s, the ATAS expanded the Emmys into a national event to honor shows aired nationwide on broadcast television. In 1955, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences (NATAS) was formed in New York City as a sister organization to serve members on the East Coast. While the ATAS maintained a separate ceremony to honor shows aired locally in the Los Angeles area, the NATAS established regional chapters throughout the rest of the United States, with each one developing their own local Emmy ceremony for local programming.\n\nOriginally, there was only one Emmy event held per year to honor shows nationally broadcast in the United States. In 1974, the first Daytime Emmy ceremony was held to specifically honor achievement in national daytime programming. Other area-specific Emmy events soon followed. Also, the International Emmy Awards, honoring television programs produced and initially aired outside the U.S., was established in the early 1970s. Meanwhile, all Emmys awarded prior to the emergence of these separate, area-specific events are listed along with the Primetime Emmy Awards in the ATAS's official records.\n\nIn 1977, due to various conflicts, the ATAS and the NATAS agreed to split ties. However, they also agreed to share ownership of the Emmy statue and trademark, with each responsible for administering a specific set of award events. There was an exception regarding the Engineering Awards (those honoring individuals, companies, or scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television): The NATAS continues to administer the Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards, while the ATAS holds the separate Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards.\n\nWith the rise of cable television in the 1980s, cable programs first became eligible for the Primetime Emmys in 1988, and the Daytime Emmys in 1989. In 2011, the ABC Television Network cancelled the soap operas \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\", and sold the two shows' licensing rights to the production company Prospect Park so they could be continued on web television; this prompted NATAS to create a new Daytime Emmys category for the 2013 ceremony to honor such web-only series. The ATAS also began accepting original online-only web television programs in 2013.\n\nThe Emmy statuette, depicting a winged woman holding an atom, was designed by television engineer Louis McManus, who used his wife as the model. The ATAS rejected forty-seven proposals before settling on McManus's design in 1948. The statuette \"has since become the symbol of the TV Academy's goal of supporting and uplifting the art and science of television: The wings represent the muse of art; the atom the electron of science.\"\n\nWhen deciding a name for the award, ATAS founder Syd Cassyd originally suggested \"Ike\", the nickname for the television iconoscope tube. However, \"Ike\" was also the popular nickname of World War II hero and future U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and the ATAS members wanted something unique. Finally, television engineer and the third academy president Harry Lubcke suggested the name \"Immy\", a term commonly used for the image orthicon tube used in the early cameras. After \"Immy\" was chosen, it was later feminized to Emmy to match their female statuette.\n\nEach Primetime Emmy statuette weighs six pounds, twelve-and-a-half ounces (3.08 kg), and is made of copper, nickel, silver, and gold. The statue stands tall with a base diameter of and weight of 88 oz (2.5 kg). The Regional Emmy Award statuette is 11.5 inches (29 cm) tall with a base diameter of 5.5 inches (14 cm) and weight of 48 oz (1.4 kg). Each takes five and a half hours to make and is handled with white gloves to prevent fingerprints. The Regional Emmy Awards are made by Society Awards, a New York-based company that also makes the Golden Globe Awards. The Primetime Emmy statues are manufactured by R.S. Owens & Company based in Chicago, Illinois, which was also charged with manufacturing the Academy Award statues until 2016, when AMPAS switched to Polich Tallix in Walden, New York.\n\nAs its trademark owners, the ATAS and the NATAS hold firm rules on the use of the \"Emmy\" image as well as its name. For example, the Emmy statuette must always appear facing left. Any copyright notice for the statue should read \"ATAS/NATAS\", listing both academies. Academy members must also obtain permission to use the statue image or name for promotional uses even though they are winners of the award. Furthermore, DVDs of Emmy-winning shows may reference the fact that they received an Emmy, but cannot use the statue image unless it is capable of being removed from all copies one year after the award is presented.\n\nVarious area-specific Emmy competitions are held annually throughout the calendar year, ranging from honoring nationally televised shows to regionally and locally produced programs. Each event has its own set of award categories, nominating and voting procedures, and rules regarding voting committees. It is not uncommon for one ceremony to have some of the same category names that another Emmy event uses. (e.g. \"Primetime\" Emmy for Outstanding Drama Series and \"Daytime\" Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series).\n\nA show that enters into one of the national Emmy competitions cannot also be entered into any of the others. For example, syndicated shows whose air times vary between media markets may be eligible for both the Daytime and Primetime Emmys, but cannot enter in both. In general, a show is considered national if it reaches more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that do not reach at least 50 percent of the country may enter into the Regional Emmys instead. Web television shows are treated similar to syndicated shows: they must be available for downloading or streaming by more than 50 percent of the US national market to be eligible in one of the national Emmy competitions, and they can only enter into one of those national Emmy ceremonies.\n\nRegardless of which area-specific competitions in which one wins an Emmy, all winners are called an \"Emmy Winner\".\n\nThe Primetime Emmys are presented in recognition of excellence in American primetime television programming. Ceremonies generally are held in mid-September, on the Sunday before the official start of the fall television season, and are currently broadcast in rotation among the ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox networks.\n\nSome award categories presented to behind-the-scenes personnel such as art directors, costume designers, cinematographers, casting directors, and sound designers are awarded at a separate Creative Arts Emmys ceremony held a few days earlier.\n\nThe Primetime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the ATAS. For most categories, members from each of the ATAS's branches vote around June to determine the nominees only in their respective categories. All members can however vote for nominations in the best program categories. The final voting to determine the winners is held in August.\n\nThe Daytime Emmy Awards, generally held in May or June, are presented in recognition of excellence in American daytime television programming. The first daytime-themed Emmy Awards were given out at the primetime ceremony in 1972, but the first separate awards show made just for daytime programming was not held until 1974.\n\nLike the Primetime Emmys, a separate Creative Arts Emmy ceremony is also held a few days earlier to honor the behind-the-scenes personnel working in daytime television.\n\nThe Daytime Emmys are run and voted on by members of the NATAS. Voting is done by peer judging panels. Any active member of the NATAS who has national credits for at least two years and within the last five years is eligible to be a judge. Depending on the category, voting is done using either a ratings score criteria or a preferential scoring system. All the drama acting categories have an additional preliminary voting round called the pre-nominations, where one or two actors from each show is selected to then move on and be considered for the primary nominations for the awards.\n\nThe Sports Emmy Awards are presented by the NATAS for excellence in sports programming. The awards ceremony takes place every Spring, usually sometime in the last two weeks in April or the first week in May, and is held on a Monday night in New York City.\n\nVoting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national sports production to serve as judges. The panels are organized so that they only have one representative from each corporate entity (i.e. CBS Corporation, Disney, NBCUniversal, Fox Corporation, WarnerMedia etc.) Most categories only have a single voting round using preferential scoring system. The top 5 entries in each category are announced as the nominations, and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.\n\nThe News & Documentary Emmy Awards are presented by the NATAS for excellence in national news and documentary programming. The awards ceremony takes place every fall.\n\nVoting is done by peer judging panels. The NATAS solicits anybody with significant experience in national news or documentary reporting or production to serve as judges. Most categories have two voting rounds, with separate judging panels in each round. The top entries in each category are announced as the nominations, and then the top entry is announced as the Emmy winner later at the awards ceremony.\n\nThe Primetime Engineering Emmy Awards presented by the ATAS and the Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards presented by the NATAS are two separate competitions that honor individuals, companies, or to scientific or technical organizations in recognition of significant developments and contributions to the engineering and technological aspects of television. Generally, the NATAS's Technology & Engineering Emmys ceremony is held in January, while the ATAS's Primetime Engineering Emmys are presented in October.\n\nEach academy has its own separate panel of highly qualified, experienced engineers in the television industry to determine their respective award recipients. Among the ATAS's Engineering Emmy Award repertoire is the Philo T. Farnsworth Award, given to honor companies who have significantly affected the state of television and broadcast engineering over a long period of time.\n\nThere are 20 regional chapters located across the United States that each conduct regional awards to recognize excellence in all the regional television markets, including state to state programming as well as local news and locally produced shows. Nineteen of the regional chapters are affiliated with the NATAS, while the Los Angeles-based ATAS acts as the regional chapter serving the Los Angeles area.\n\nIn general, a show is considered regional if it does not reach more than 50 percent of U.S. households; programs that reach more than 50 percent of the country must enter into one of the national Emmy competitions instead.\n\nThe Regional Emmys are essential in helping NATAS and ATAS honor the works of deserving individuals in local TV through a regional outreach. Like the national awards, each region goes through their own rigorous nomination and voting procedures. Committees are formed to review entries for eligibility and high standards. Once accepted, each entry goes before different review committees, and their votes are cast to determine the final nominees. The final votes are then calculated by certified accounting firms within each region. Regardless of winning on a national or regional level, all recipients are Emmy Award winners.\n\nOriginally, each Regional Emmy Awards ceremony primarily focused on only honoring individuals in local news programming. The regionals have since been expanded to encompass all locally and state to state-produced shows that receive less than fifty percent of the country's viewing audience.\n\nThe International Emmy Awards recognizes excellence in TV programming that is produced initially outside the United States. They have been presented annually by the IATAS since 1973. The award ceremony generally takes place in November in New York City.\n\nAny non-U.S. organization or individual (i.e. a network, a local or regional television station, producer, director, or writer) may submit a program (unless the show qualifies for the Non-English Language U.S. Primetime Program categories). Organizations or individuals who do not hold copyright ownership of a program must obtain consent from the rights owner before presenting a submission. This process is independent from membership.\n\nThe College Television Awards are presented by the ATAS in recognition of excellence in college student-produced works. College students nationwide can submit productions and receive recognition in such categories as Comedy, Documentary, Drama, Music, Newscasts, and Series. Entries are first judged by members of the ATAS specializing in each respective field. Winners are then selected by Blue Ribbon Panels. Any work submitted must include a form signed from a faculty advisor to verify that it was produced for a school related group, project, or class.\n\nSimilarly, the National Student Production Awards are presented by the NATAS in recognition of excellence in high school student-produced works. High school students nationwide can submit productions and receive recognition in news, craft and programming categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "13135", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=13135", "title": "Game show", "text": "Game show\n\nA game show is a type of radio, television, or stage show in which contestants, individually or as teams, play a game which involves answering questions or solving puzzles, usually for money or prizes. Alternatively, a \"gameshow\" can be a demonstrative program about a game [while usually retaining the spirit of an awards ceremony]. In the former, contestants may be invited from a pool of public applicants. Game shows often reward players with prizes such as cash, trips and goods and services provided by the show's sponsor prize suppliers.\n\nGame shows began to appear on radio and television in the late 1930s. The very first television game show, \"Spelling Bee\", as well as the first radio game show, \"Information Please\", were both broadcast in 1938; the first major success in the game show genre was \"Dr. I.Q.\", a radio quiz show that began in 1939. \"Truth or Consequences\" was the first game show to air on commercially licensed television; the \"CBS Television Quiz\" followed shortly thereafter. Its first episode aired in 1941 as an experimental broadcast. Over the course of the 1950s, as television began to pervade the popular culture, game shows quickly became a fixture. Daytime game shows would be played for lower stakes to target stay-at-home housewives. Higher-stakes programs would air in primetime. During the late 1950s, high-stakes games such as \"Twenty-One\" and \"The $64,000 Question\" began a rapid rise in popularity. However, the rise of quiz shows proved to be short-lived. In 1959, many of the higher stakes game shows were discovered to be rigged and ratings declines led to most of the primetime games being canceled.\n\nAn early variant of the game show, the panel game, survived the quiz show scandals. On shows like \"What's My Line?\", \"I've Got A Secret\", and \"To Tell the Truth\", panels of celebrities would interview a guest in an effort to determine some fact about them; in others, celebrities would answer questions. Panel games had success in primetime until the late 1960s, when they were collectively dropped from television because of their perceived low budget nature. Panel games made a comeback in American daytime television (where the lower budgets were tolerated) in the 1970s through comedy-driven shows such as \"Match Game\" and \"Hollywood Squares\". In the UK, commercial demographic pressures were not as prominent, and restrictions on game shows made in the wake of the scandals limited the style of games that could be played and the amount of money that could be awarded. Panel shows there were kept in primetime and have continued to thrive; they have transformed into showcases for the nation's top stand-up comedians on shows such as \"Have I Got News for You\", \"Would I Lie to You?\", \"Mock the Week\", \"QI\", and \"8 Out of 10 Cats\", all of which put a heavy emphasis on comedy, leaving the points as mere formalities. The focus on quick-witted comedians has resulted in strong ratings, which, combined with low costs of production, have only spurred growth in the UK panel show phenomenon.\n\nGame shows remained a fixture of US daytime television through the 1960s after the quiz show scandals. Lower-stakes games made a slight comeback in daytime in the early 1960s; examples include \"Jeopardy!\" which began in 1964 and the original version of \"The Match Game\" first aired in 1962. \"Let's Make a Deal\" began in 1963 and the 1960s also marked the debut of \"Hollywood Squares\", \"Password\", \"The Dating Game\", and \"The Newlywed Game\".\n\nThough CBS gave up on daytime game shows in 1968, the other networks did not follow suit. Color television was introduced to the game show genre in the late 1960s on all three networks. The 1970s saw a renaissance of the game show as new games and massive upgrades to existing games made debuts on the major networks. \"The New Price Is Right\", an update of the 1950s-era game show \"The Price Is Right\", debuted in 1972 and marked CBS's return to the game show format in its effort to draw wealthier, suburban viewers. \"The Match Game\" became \"Big Money\" \"Match Game 73\", which proved popular enough to prompt a spin-off, \"Family Feud\", on ABC in 1976. \"The $10,000 Pyramid\" and its numerous higher-stakes derivatives also debuted in 1973, while the 1970s also saw the return of formerly disgraced producer and host Jack Barry, who debuted \"The Joker's Wild\" and a clean version of the previously rigged \"Tic-Tac-Dough\" in the 1970s. \"Wheel of Fortune\" debuted on NBC in 1975. The Prime Time Access Rule, which took effect in 1971, barred networks from broadcasting in the 7–8 p.m. time slot immediately preceding prime time, opening up time slots for syndicated programming. Most of the syndicated programs were \"nighttime\" adaptations of network daytime game shows. These game shows originally aired once a week, but by the late 1970s and early 1980s most of the games had transitioned to five days a week.\n\nGame shows were the lowest priority of television networks and were rotated out every thirteen weeks if unsuccessful. Most tapes were destroyed until the early 1980s. Over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s, as fewer new hits (e.g. \"Press Your Luck\", \"Sale of the Century\", and \"Card Sharks\") were produced, game shows lost their permanent place in the daytime lineup. ABC transitioned out of the daytime game show format in the mid-1980s (briefly returning to the format for one season in 1990 with a \"Match Game\" revival). NBC's game block also lasted until 1991, but the network attempted to bring them back in 1993 before cancelling its game show block again in 1994. CBS phased out most of its game shows, except for \"The Price Is Right\", by 1993. To the benefit of the genre, the moves of \"Wheel of Fortune\" and a modernized revival of \"Jeopardy!\" to syndication in 1983 and 1984, respectively, was and remains highly successful; the two are, to this day, fixtures in the prime time \"access period\".\n\nCable television also allowed for the debut of game shows such as \"Supermarket Sweep\" and \"Debt\" (Lifetime), \"Trivial Pursuit\" and \"Family Challenge\" (Family Channel), and \"Double Dare\" (Nickelodeon). It also opened up a previously underdeveloped market for game show reruns. General interest networks such as CBN Cable Network and USA Network had popular blocks for game show reruns from the mid-1980s to the mid-'90s before that niche was overtaken by Game Show Network in 1994.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, game shows have had a more steady and permanent place in the television lineup and never lost popularity in the 1990s as they did in the United States, due in part to the fact that game shows were highly regulated by the Independent Broadcasting Authority in the 1980s and that those restrictions were lifted in the 1990s, allowing for higher-stakes games to be played.\n\nAfter the popularity of game shows hit a nadir in the mid-1990s United States (at which point \"The Price Is Right\" was the only game show still on daytime network television and numerous game shows designed for cable television were canceled), the British game show \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\" began distribution around the globe. Upon the show's American debut in 1999, it was a hit and became a regular part of ABC's primetime lineup until 2002; that show would eventually air in syndication for seventeen years afterward. Several shorter-lived high-stakes games were attempted around the time of the millennium, both in the United States and the United Kingdom, such as \"Winning Lines\", \"The Chair\", \"Greed\", \"Paranoia\", and \"Shafted\", leading to some dubbing this period as \"The Million-Dollar Game Show Craze\". The boom quickly went bust, as by July 2000, almost all of the imitator million-dollar shows were canceled (one of those exceptions was \"Winning Lines\", which continued to air in the United Kingdom until 2004 even though it was canceled in the United States in early 2000); these higher stakes contests nevertheless opened the door to reality television contests such as \"Survivor\" and \"Big Brother\", in which contestants win large sums of money for outlasting their peers in a given environment. Several game shows returned to daytime in syndication during this time as well, such as \"Family Feud\", \"Hollywood Squares\", and \"Millionaire\".\n\nIn the U.S., CBS is currently the only major network airing daily national game shows. It still airs \"The Price Is Right\" and, as of 2009, is also airing a revival of \"Let's Make a Deal\". \"Deal\" airs on weekdays at a time chosen by each CBS affiliate, while \"Price\" airs weekdays at 10 am or 11 am in most markets. The oldest, continually aired radio quiz show in the United States was \"Simply Trivia\", which aired on public radio station WYSO in Yellow Springs, Ohio. It ran from 1972 through 2014.\n\n\"Wheel of Fortune\", \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Family Feud\" have continued in syndication. To keep pace with the prime-time quiz shows, \"Jeopardy!\" doubled its question values in 2001 and lifted its winnings limit in 2003, which one year later allowed Ken Jennings to become the show's first multi-million dollar winner; it has also increased the stakes of its tournaments and put a larger focus on contestants with strong personalities. The show has since produced two more millionaires, tournament winner Brad Rutter and recent champion James Holzhauer. \"Family Feud\" revived in popularity with a change in tone under host Steve Harvey to include more suggestive humor. \n\nIn 2009, actress and comedienne Kim Coles became the first black woman to host a prime time game show, \"Pay It Off\".\n\nThe rise of digital television in the United States opened up a large market for rerun programs. Buzzr was established by FremantleMedia North America, owners of numerous classic U.S. game shows, as a broadcast outlet for its archived holdings in June 2015. There has also been a rise of live game shows at festivals and public venues, where the general audience can participate in the show, such as the science-inspired \"Geek Out Game Show\" or the \"Yuck Show\".\n\nSince the latter half of the 2000s, several game shows were conducted in a tournament format; examples included \"PokerFace\" (which never aired in North America), \"Duel\", \"The Million Second Quiz\", \"500 Questions\", \"The American Bible Challenge\", and \"Mental Samurai\". Most game shows conducted in this manner only lasted for one season.\n\nA boom in prime time revivals of classic daytime game shows began to emerge in the mid-2010s. In 2016, ABC packaged the existing \"Celebrity Family Feud\", which had returned in 2015, with new versions of \"To Tell the Truth,\" \"The $100,000 Pyramid\", and \"Match Game\" in 2016; new versions of \"Press Your Luck\" and \"Card Sharks\" would follow in 2019. TBS launched a marijuana-themed revival of \"The Joker's Wild\", hosted by Snoop Dogg, in October 2017. This is in addition to a number of original game concepts that appeared near the same time, including \"Awake\", \"Deal or No Deal\" (which originally aired in 2005), \"Child Support\", \"Hollywood Game Night\", \"1 vs. 100\", \"Minute to Win It\" (which originally aired in 2010), and \"The Wall\", and a string of music-themed games such as \"Don't Forget the Lyrics!\", \"The Singing Bee\", and \"Beat Shazam\".\n\nThe popularity of game shows in the United States was closely paralleled around the world. Reg Grundy Organisation, for instance, would buy the international rights for American game shows and reproduce them in other countries, especially in Grundy's native Australia. Most game show formats that are popular in one country are franchised to others.\n\nGame shows have had an inconsistent place in Canadian television, with most homegrown game shows there being made for the French-speaking Quebecois market and the majority of English-language game shows in the country being rebroadcast from, or made with the express intent of export to, the United States. There have been exceptions to this (see, for instance, the long-running \"Definition\"). Unlike reality television franchises, international game show franchises generally only see Canadian adaptations in a series of specials, based heavily on the American versions but usually with a Canadian host to allow for Canadian content credits (one of those exceptions was \"Le Banquier\", a Quebec French-language version of \"Deal or No Deal\" which aired on TVA from 2008 to 2015). The smaller markets and lower revenue opportunities for Canadian shows in general also affect game shows there, with Canadian games (especially Quebecois ones) often having very low budgets for prizes, unless the series is made for export. Canadian contestants are generally allowed to participate on American game shows, and there have been at least two Canadian game show hosts – Monty Hall and Alex Trebek – who have gone on to long careers hosting American series, while Jim Perry, an American host, was prominent as a host of Canadian shows.\n\nAmerican game shows have a tendency to hire stronger contestants than their British or Australian counterparts. Many of the most successful game show contestants in America would likely never be cast in a British or Australian game show for fear of having them dominate the game, according to Mark Labbett, who appeared in all three countries on the game show \"The Chase\".\n\nMany of the prizes awarded on game shows are provided through product placement, but in some cases they are provided by private organizations or purchased at either the full price or at a discount by the show. There is the widespread use of \"promotional consideration\", in which a game show receives a subsidy from an advertiser in return for awarding that manufacturer's product as a prize or consolation prize. Some products supplied by manufacturers may not be intended to be awarded at all and are instead just used as part of the gameplay (such as the low-priced items used in several pricing games of \"The Price Is Right\").\n\nFor high-stakes games, a network may purchase prize indemnity insurance to avoid paying the cost of a rare but expensive prize out of pocket. If the said prize is won too often, the insurance company may refuse to insure a show; this was a factor in the discontinuation of \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" series of prime-time specials. In April 2008, three of the contestants on \"The Price Is Right $1,000,000 Spectacular\" won the top prize in a five-episode span after fifteen episodes without a winner, due in large part to a change in the rules. The insurance companies had made it extremely difficult to get further insurance for the remaining episodes. A network or syndicator may also opt to distribute large cash prizes in the form of an annuity, spreading the cost of the prize out over several years or decades.\n\nFrom about 1960 through the rest of the 20th century, American networks placed restrictions on the amount of money that could be given away on a game show, in an effort to avoid a repeat of the scandals of the 1950s. This usually took the form of an earnings cap that forced a player to retire once they had won a certain amount of money or a limit on how many episodes, usually five, on which a player could appear on a show. The introduction of syndicated games, particularly in the 1980s, eventually allowed for more valuable prizes and extended runs on a particular show. British television was under even stricter regulations on prizes until the 1990s, seriously restricting the value of prizes that could be given and disallowing games of chance to have an influence on the results of the game. (Thus, the British version of \"The Price Is Right\" at first did not include the American version's \"Showcase Showdown\", in which contestants spun a large wheel to determine who would advance to the Showcase bonus round.) In Canada, prizes were limited not by bureaucracy but necessity, as the much smaller population limited the audience of shows marketed toward that country. The lifting of these restrictions in the 1990s was a major factor in the explosion of high-stakes game shows in the later part of that decade in both the U.S. and Britain and, subsequently, around the world.\n\nA bonus round (also known as a bonus game or an end game) usually follows a main game as a bonus to the winner of that game. In the bonus round, the stakes are higher and the game is considered to be tougher.\n\nThe game play of a bonus round usually varies from the standard game play of the front game, and there are often borrowed or related elements of the main game in the bonus round to ensure the entire show has a unified premise. Though some end games are referred to as \"bonus rounds\", many are not specifically referred to as such in games but fit the same general role.\n\nThere is no one formula for the format of a bonus round. There are differences in almost every bonus round, though there are many recurring elements from show to show. The bonus round is often played for the show's top prize.\n\nUntil the 1960s, most game shows did not offer a bonus round. In traditional two-player formats, the winner – if a game show's rules provided for this – became the champion and simply played a new challenger either on the next show or after the commercial break.\n\nOne of the earliest forms of bonus rounds was the Jackpot Round of the original series \"Beat the Clock\". After two rounds of performing stunts, the wife of the contestant couple would perform at a jackpot board for a prize. The contestant was shown a famous quotation or common phrase, and the words were scrambled. To win the announced bonus, the contestant had to unscramble the words within 20 seconds. The contestant received a consolation gift worth over $200 if she was unsuccessful.\n\nAnother early bonus round ended each episode of \"You Bet Your Life\" with the team who won the most money answering one final question for a jackpot which started at $1,000 and increased $500 each week until won.\n\nAnother early example was the Lightning Round on the word game \"Password\", starting in 1961. The contestant who won the front game played a quick-fire series of passwords within 60 seconds, netting $50 per correctly guessed word, for a maximum bonus prize of $250.\n\nThe bonus round came about after game show producer Mark Goodson was first presented \"Password\", contending that it was not enough to merely guess passwords during the show. \"We needed something more, and that's how the Lightning Round was invited,\" said Howard Felsher, who produced \"Password\" and \"Family Feud\". \"From that point on every game show had to have an end round. You'd bring a show to a network and they'd say, 'What's the endgame?' as if they had thought of it themselves.\"\n\nThe end game of \"Match Game\", hosted for most of its run by Gene Rayburn, served as the impetus for a completely new game show. The first part of \"Match Game\"s \"Super-Match\" bonus round, called the \"Audience Match\", asked contestants to guess how a studio audience responded to a question. In 1975, with then regular panelist Richard Dawson becoming restless and progressively less cooperative, Goodson decided that this line of questioning would make a good game show of its own, and the concept eventually became \"Family Feud\", as whose inaugural host Dawson was hired.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "20913980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20913980", "title": "Sitcom", "text": "Sitcom\n\nA sitcom, clipping for situational comedy (situation comedy in the U.S.), is a genre of comedy centered on a fixed set of characters who carry over from episode to episode. Sitcoms can be contrasted with sketch comedy, where a troupe may use new characters in each sketch, and stand-up comedy, where a comedian tells jokes and stories to an audience. Sitcoms originated in radio, but today are found mostly on television as one of its dominant narrative forms. This form can also include mockumentaries.\n\nA situational comedy television programme may be recorded in front of a studio audience, depending on the programme’s production format. The effect of a live studio audience can be imitated or enhanced by the use of a laugh track. During filming productions, the laugh track is usually pre-recorded.\n\nCritics disagree over the utility of the term \"sitcom\" in classifying shows that have come into existence since the turn of the century. Many contemporary American sitcoms use the single-camera setup and do not feature a laugh track, thus often resembling the dramedy shows of the 1980s and 1990s rather than the traditional sitcom. Other topics of debate have included whether or not cartoons, such as \"The Simpsons\" or \"Family Guy\", can be classified as sitcoms.\n\nThe terms \"situational comedy\" or \"sitcom\" were not commonly used until the 1950s. There were prior examples on radio, but the first television sitcom is said to be \"Pinwright's Progress\", ten episodes being broadcast on the BBC in the United Kingdom between 1946 and 1947. In the United States, director and producer William Asher has been credited with being the \"man who invented the sitcom\", having directed over two dozen of the leading sitcoms, including \"I Love Lucy,\" from the 1950s through the 1970s.\n\nThere have been few long-running Australian-made sitcoms, but many US and UK sitcoms have been successful there. UK sitcoms are a staple of government broadcaster Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC); in the 1970s and 1980s many UK sitcoms also screened on the Seven Network. By 1986, UK comedies \"Bless This House\" and \"Are You Being Served?\" had been repeated by ABC Television several times, and were then acquired and screened by the Seven Network, in prime time.\n\nIn 1981, \"Daily at Dawn\" was the first Australian comedy series to feature a regular gay character (Terry Bader as journalist Leslie).\n\nIn 1987, \"Mother and Son\" was winner of the Television Drama Award presented by the Australian Human Rights Commission.\n\nIn 2007, \"Kath & Kim\"'s first episode of series four attracted an Australian audience of 2.521 million nationally, the highest rating ever for a first episode in the history of Australian television, until the series premiere of \"\" in 2009 with 2.58 million viewers.\n\nIn 2013, \"Please Like Me\" received an invitation to screen at the Series Mania Television Festival in Paris, was praised by critics and has garnered numerous awards and nominations.\nAlso in 2013, \"At Home With Julia\" was criticised by several social commentators as inappropriately disrespectful to the office of Prime Minister,\nthe show nevertheless proved very popular both with television audiences — becoming the most watched Australian scripted comedy series of 2011 — and with television critics. Nominated to the 2012 Australian Academy of Cinema and Television Arts Awards for Best Television Comedy Series.\n\nAlthough there have been a number of notable exceptions, Canadian television networks have generally fared poorly with their sitcom offerings, with relatively few Canadian sitcoms attaining notable success in Canada or internationally. According to television critic Bill Brioux, there are a number of structural reasons for this: the shorter seasons, typical of Canadian television production, make it harder for audiences to connect with a program before its season has concluded, and put even successful shows at risk of losing their audience between seasons because of the longer waiting time before a show returns with new episodes; the more limited marketing budgets available to Canadian television networks mean that audiences are less likely to be aware that the show exists in the first place; and the shows tend to resemble American sitcoms, in the hope of securing a lucrative sale to an American television network, even though by and large the Canadian sitcoms that have been successful have been ones, such as \"Corner Gas\" or \"King of Kensington\", that had a more distinctively Canadian flavour. Conversely, however, Canadian television has had much greater success with sketch comedy and dramedy series.\n\nThe popular show \"King of Kensington\" aired from 1975 to 1980, drawing 1.5 to 1.8 million viewers weekly at its peak.\n\n\"Corner Gas\", which ran for six seasons from 2004 to 2009, became an instant hit, averaging a million viewers per episode. It has been the recipient of six Gemini Awards, and has been nominated almost 70 times for various awards.\n\nOther noteworthy recent sitcoms have included \"Call Me Fitz\", \"Schitt's Creek\", \"Letterkenny\" and \"Kim's Convenience\", all of which have been winners of the Canadian Screen Award for Best Comedy Series.\n\nSitcoms started appearing on Indian television in the 1980s, with serials like \"Yeh Jo Hai Zindagi\" (1984) and \"Wagle Ki Duniya\" (1988) on the state-run Doordarshan channel. Gradually, as private channels were allowed, many more sitcoms followed in the 1990s, such as \"Dekh Bhai Dekh\" (1993), \"Zabaan Sambhalke\" (1993), \"Shrimaan Shrimati\" (1995), \"Office Office\" (2001), Ramani Vs Ramani (2001), \"Amrutham (Telugu serial)\", \"Khichdi\" (2002), \"Sarabhai vs Sarabhai\" (2005) to \"F.I.R.\" (2006–2015), \"Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah,\" (2008–present),\"Uppum Mulakum\" (2015–Present) , and the present most successful \"Bhabiji Ghar Par Hain\" (2015-present).SAB TV is one of the leading channels of India dedicated entirely to Sitcoms.\n\n\"El Chavo del Ocho\", which ran from 1971 to 1980, was the most watched show in the Mexican television and had a Latin American audience of 350 million viewers per episode at its peak of popularity during the mid-1970s. The show continues to be popular in Hispanic America as well as in Brazil, Spain, United States and other countries, with syndicated episodes averaging 91 million daily viewers in all of the markets where it is distributed in the Americas. Since it ceased production in 1992, the show has earned an estimated billion in syndication fees alone for Televisa.\n\n\"Gliding On\", a popular sit-com in New Zealand in the early 1980s, won multiple awards over the course of its run, including Best Comedy, Best Drama and Best Direction at the Feltex Awards.\n\nThe first Russian sitcom series was \"Strawberry\" (resembled \"Duty Pharmacy\" in Spanish format), which was aired in 1996–1997 on the RTR channel. However, the \"boom\" of Russian sitcoms began only in the 2000s — when in 2004, the STS started very successful sitcom \"My Fair Nanny\" (an adaptation of the American sitcom \"The Nanny\"). Since that time sitcoms in Russia were produced by the two largest entertainment channels of the country — STS and TNT. In 2007 the STS released the first original domestic sitcom — \"Daddy's Daughters\" (there were only adaptation before), and in 2010 TNT released \"Interns (sitcom)\" — the first sitcom, filmed as a comedy (unlike dominated \"conveyor\" sitcoms).\n\nAlthough styles of sitcom have changed over the years they tend to be based on a family, workplace or other institution, where the same group of contrasting characters is brought together in each episode. British sitcoms are typically produced in one or more series of six episodes. Most such series are conceived and developed by one or two writers.\nThe majority of British sitcoms are 30 minutes long and are recorded on studio sets in a multiple-camera setup. A subset of British comedy consciously avoids traditional situation comedy themes and storylines to branch out into more unusual topics or narrative methods. \"Blackadder\" (1983–89) and \"Yes Minister/Yes Prime Minister\" (1980–88, 2013) moved what is often a domestic or workplace genre into the corridors of power. A later development was the mockumentary in such series as \"The Office\" (2001–03).\n\nMost American sitcoms generally include episodes of 20 to 30 minutes in length, where the story is written to run a total of 22 minutes in length, leaving eight minutes for advertisements.\n\nSome popular British shows have been successfully adapted for the US.\n\nThe sitcom format was born in January 1926 with the initial broadcast of \"Sam 'n' Henry\" on WGN radio in Chicago, Illinois. The 15-minute daily program was revamped in 1928, moved to another station, renamed \"Amos 'n' Andy\", and became one of the most successful sitcoms of the period. It was also one of the earliest examples of radio syndication. Like many radio programs of the time, the two programs continued the American entertainment traditions of vaudeville and the minstrel show. Early sitcoms took the forms of recurring comedy sketches with running characters, which on national network shows often took the form of a broader variety show with vocal and instrumental music performances padding out a half-hour time slot.\n\n\"The Jack Benny Program\", a radio-TV comedy series that ran for more than three decades, is generally regarded as a high-water mark in 20th-century American comedy.\n\n\"Fibber McGee and Molly\" was one of radio's most popular sitcoms of the 1940s. The weekly half-hour domestic sitcom starring real-life husband and wife Jim Jordan and Marian Driscoll ran from 1935 to 1956 on NBC.\n\n\"Mary Kay and Johnny\", aired from 1947 to 1950, was the first sitcom broadcast on a network television in the United States and was the first program to show a couple sharing a bed, and the first series to show a woman's pregnancy on television.\n\n\"I Love Lucy\", which originally ran from 1951 to 1957 on CBS, was the most watched show in the United States in four of its six seasons, and was the first to end its run at the top of the Nielsen ratings (an accomplishment later matched only by \"The Andy Griffith Show\" in 1968 and \"Seinfeld\" in 1998). The show is still syndicated in dozens of languages across the world, and remains popular, with an American audience of 40 million each year. Colourised edits of episodes from the original series have aired semi-annually on the network since 2013, six decades after the series aired. It is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential sitcoms in history. In 2012, it was voted the 'Best TV Show of All Time' in a survey conducted by ABC News and \"People Magazine\".\n\n\"The Honeymooners\" debuted as a half-hour series on 1955 and was originally aired on the DuMont network's \"Cavalcade of Stars\" and subsequently on the CBS network's \"The Jackie Gleason Show\", which was filmed in front of a live audience. Although initially a ratings success—becoming the #2 show in the United States during its first season—it faced stiff competition from \"The Perry Como Show\", and eventually dropped to #19, ending its production after only 39 episodes (now referred to as the \"Classic 39\"). The final episode of \"The Honeymooners\" aired on September 22, 1956. Creator/producer Jackie Gleason revived \"The Honeymooners\" sporadically until 1978. \"The Honeymooners\" was one of the first U.S. television shows to portray working-class married couples in a gritty, non-idyllic manner (the show is set mostly in the Kramdens' kitchen, in a neglected Brooklyn apartment building). Steven Sheehan explains the popularity of \"The Honeymooners\" as the embodiment of working-class masculinity in the character of Ralph Kramden, and postwar ideals in American society regarding work, housing, consumerism, and consumer satisfaction. The series demonstrated visually the burdens of material obligations and participation in consumer culture, as well as the common use of threats of domestic violence in working class households. Art Carney won five Emmy Awards for his portrayal of Ed Norton — two for the original \"Jackie Gleason Show\", one for \"The Honeymooners\", and two for the final version of \"The Jackie Gleason Show\". He was nominated for another two (1957, 1966) but lost. Gleason and Audrey Meadows were both nominated in 1956 for their work on \"The Honeymooners\". Meadows was also nominated for Emmys for her portrayal of Alice Kramden in 1954 and 1957. In 1997, the episodes \"The $99,000 Answer\" and \"TV or Not TV\" were respectively ranked #6 and #26 on \"TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\" and in 1999, \"TV Guide\" published a list titled \"TV's 100 Greatest Characters Ever!\" Ed Norton was #20, and Ralph Kramden was #2. In 2002, \"The Honeymooners\" was listed at #3 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and #13 on their list of the \"60 Greatest Shows of All Time\" in 2013.\n\n\"The Andy Griffith Show\", first televised on CBS between 1960 and 1968, was consistently placed in the top ten during its run. The show is one of only three shows to have its final season be the number one ranked show on television, the other two being \"I Love Lucy\" and \"Seinfeld\". In 1998, more than 5 million people a day watched the show's re-runs on 120 stations.\n\n\"The Dick Van Dyke Show\", initially aired on CBS from 1961 to 1966, won 15 Emmy Awards. In 1997, the episodes \"Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth\" and \"It May Look Like a Walnut\" were ranked at 8 and 15 respectively on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. In 2002, it was ranked at 13 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and in 2013, it was ranked at 20 on their list of the 60 Best Series.\n\n\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" ran from 1970 to 1977, winning 29 Emmy Awards. MTM Enterprises, the studio formed to produce it, would produce dozens of sitcoms from the 1970s through the 1990s.\n\nThe series \"M*A*S*H\", aired in the U.S. from 1972 to 1983, and was honoured with a Peabody Award in 1976 and was ranked number 25 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time in 2002. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the fifth-best written TV series ever and \"TV Guide\" ranked it as the eighth-greatest show of all time. The episodes \"Abyssinia, Henry\" and \"The Interview\" were ranked number 20 and number 80, respectively, on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time in 1997. And the finale, \"Goodbye, Farewell and Amen\", became the most-watched and highest-rated single television episode in the U.S. television history at the time, with a record-breaking of 125 million viewers (60.2 rating and 77 share), according to \"The New York Times\".\n\n\"Sanford and Son\", which ran from 1972 to 1977, was included on the \"Time\" magazine's list of the \"100 Best TV Shows of All Time\" in 2007.\n\n\"All in the Family\", premiered on January 1971, is often regarded in the United States as one of the greatest television series of all time. Following a lackluster first season, the show became the most watched show in the United States during summer re-runs and afterwards ranked number one in the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It became the first television series to reach the milestone of having topped the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive years. The episode \"Sammy's Visit\" was ranked number 13 on \"TV Guide's\" 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. \"TV Guide's \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time ranked \"All in the Family\" as number four. \"Bravo\" also named the show's protagonist, Archie Bunker, TV's greatest character of all time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked \"All in the Family\" the fourth-best written TV series ever, and \"TV Guide\" ranked it as the fourth-greatest show of all time.\n\n\"One Day at a Time\" is a situation comedy developed by Norman Lear. The show aired on CBS and ran from December, 1975 until May, 1984. It followed a recently divorced mother and her two daughters as they dealt with the problems and situations that come with growing up, and raising kids in a single parent household. It is the first show to feature Valerie Bertinelli, and emphasised her character as the show progressed.\n\n\"Cheers,\" which ran for eleven seasons, was one of the most successful sitcoms in the 80s, airing from 1982 to 1993. It was followed by a spin-off sitcom in the 90s, \"Frasier\". During its run, \"Cheers\" became one of the most popular series of all time and has received critical acclaim. In 1997, the episodes \"Thanksgiving Orphans\" and \"Home Is the Sailor\", aired originally in 1987, were respectively ranked No. 7 and No. 45 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. In 2002, \"Cheers\" was ranked No. 18 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked it as the eighth best written TV series and \"TV Guide\" ranked it #11 on their list of the 60 Greatest Shows of All Time.\n\n\"The Cosby Show\", airing from 1984 until 1992, spent five consecutive seasons as the number one rated show on television. \"The Cosby Show\" and \"All in the Family\" are the only sitcoms in the history of the Nielsen ratings, to be the number one show for five seasons. It spent all eight of its seasons in the Top 20. According to \"TV Guide\", the show \"was TV's biggest hit in the 1980s, and almost single handedly revived the sitcom genre and NBC's ratings fortunes.\" \"TV Guide\" also ranked it 28th on their list of \"50 Greatest Shows\". In addition, Cliff Huxtable was named as the \"Greatest Television Dad\". In May 1992, \"Entertainment Weekly\" stated that \"The Cosby Show\" helped to make possible a larger variety of shows with a predominantly African-American cast, from \"In Living Color\" to \"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\".\n\n\"Seinfeld\", which originally ran for nine seasons on NBC from 1989 to 1998, led the Nielsen ratings in seasons six and nine, and finished among the top two (with NBC's \"ER\") every year from 1994 to 1998. In 2002, \"TV Guide\" named \"Seinfeld\" the greatest television program of all time. In 1997, the episodes \"The Boyfriend\" and \"The Parking Garage\" were respectively ranked numbers 4 and 33 on \"TV Guide\"'s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time, and in 2009, \"The Contest\" was ranked #1 on the same magazine's list of TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time. E! named it the \"number 1 reason the '90s ruled.\" In 2013, the Writers Guild of America named \"Seinfeld\" the No. 2 Best Written TV Series of All Time (second to \"The Sopranos\"). That same year, \"Entertainment Weekly\" named it the No. 3 best TV series of all time and TV Guide ranked it at No. 2. Another popular sitcom from this decade was \"Roseanne\", which ran from 1988 to 1997.\n\n\"The Nanny\", aired on CBS from 1993 to 1999, earned a Rose d'Or and one Emmy Award, out of a total of twelve nominations. The sitcom was the first new show delivered to CBS for the 1993 season and the highest-tested pilot at the network in years. The series was also hugely successful internationally, especially in Australia.\n\n\"The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\" was a sitcom which ran from 1990 to 1996. The series stars Will Smith as a fictionalised version of himself, a street-smart teenager from West Philadelphia who is sent to move in with his wealthy aunt and uncle in their Bel Air mansion after getting into a fight on a local basketball court. It became one of the popular sitcoms during the 1990s, despite only one Emmy nomination and moderately positive critical reception.\n\n\"Friends\", which originally aired on NBC from 1994 to 2004, received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time.

The show ranked no. 21 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and no. 5 on \"Empire\" magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 1997, the episode \"The One with the Prom Video\" was ranked no. 100 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. In 2013, \"Friends\" ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time and no. 28 on TV Guide's 60 Best TV Series of All Time. In 2014, the series was ranked by \"Mundo Estranho\" the Best TV Series of All Time.\n\n\"Frasier\", with five wins in its first five seasons, set the record for most consecutive Emmy awards for Outstanding Comedy Series, a record that has since been matched by \"Modern Family\". The series holds the record for most total Emmy wins, 37, shattering the record of 29 which had been set by \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\". Frasier is considered the most successful spin-off series in television history, beginning its run one season after \"Cheers\" went off the air, where the character of Frasier Crane had been appearing for nine years. \"Frasier\" ran from 1993 to 2004.\n\nIn early 2000s, \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" premiered on HBO. The series was created by Larry David, who stars as a semi-fictionalized version of himself following his life after the end of his work in Seinfeld. \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has received high critical acclaim and has grown in popularity since its debut. It has been nominated for 38 Primetime Emmy Awards, and Robert B. Weide received an Emmy for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series for the episode \"Krazee Eyez Killa\".

In 2007, \"Time\" listed the show among its \"All-TIME 100 TV Shows\"; in 2008, it was ranked 16th on \"Entertainment Weekly\" \"New TV Classics\" list. In 2011, IGN named \"Arrested Development\" the \"funniest show of all time\". Its humour has been cited as a key influence on later single-camera sitcoms such as \"30 Rock\" and \"Community\".\n\n\"The Office\" is a sitcom that aired on NBC from 24 March 2005 to 16 May 2013. It is an adaptation of the BBC series of the same name. The first season of \"The Office\" was met with mixed reviews, but the following four seasons received widespread acclaim from television critics. These seasons were included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several awards including four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy Series in 2006. While later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality, earlier writers oversaw the final season and ended the show's run with a positive reception.\n\n\"How I Met Your Mother\" was a sitcom which aired from 2005 to 2014 on CBS, lasting 9 series.

In June 2019, the series was revived by Pop TV, making it the first cancelled Netflix/streaming TV series to be revived for a cable network, rather than the other way around as usual.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "27009", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=27009", "title": "Soap opera", "text": "Soap opera\n\nA soap opera is a radio or television serial dealing especially with domestic situations and frequently characterized by melodrama and sentimentality. The term \"soap opera\" originated from radio dramas being sponsored by soap manufacturers.\n\nBBC Radio's \"The Archers\", first broadcast in 1950, is the world's longest-running radio soap opera; the world's longest-running television soap opera is \"Coronation Street\", first broadcast on ITV in 1960.\n\nA crucial element that defines the soap opera is the open-ended serial nature of the narrative, with stories spanning several episodes. One of the defining features that makes a television program a soap opera, according to Albert Moran, is \"that form of television that works with a continuous open narrative. Each episode ends with a promise that the storyline is to be continued in another episode\". In 2012, \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Robert Lloyd wrote of daily dramas,\n\nAlthough melodramatically eventful, soap operas such as this also have a luxury of space that makes them seem more naturalistic; indeed, the economics of the form demand long scenes, and conversations that a 22-episodes-per-season weekly series might dispense with in half a dozen lines of dialogue may be drawn out, as here, for pages. You spend more time even with the minor characters; the apparent villains grow less apparently villainous.\n\nSoap opera storylines run concurrently, intersect and lead into further developments. An individual episode of a soap opera will generally switch between several different concurrent narrative threads that may at times interconnect and affect one another or may run entirely independent to each other. Episodes may feature some of the show's current storylines, but not always all of them. Especially in daytime serials and those that are broadcast each weekday, there is some rotation of both storyline and actors so any given storyline or actor will appear in some but usually not all of a week's worth of episodes. Soap operas rarely bring all the current storylines to a conclusion at the same time. When one storyline ends, there are several other story threads at differing stages of development. Soap opera episodes typically end on some sort of cliffhanger, and the season finale (if a soap incorporates a break between seasons) ends in the same way, only to be resolved when the show returns for the start of a new yearly broadcast.\n\nEvening soap operas and those that air at a rate of one episode per week are more likely to feature the entire cast in each episode, and to represent all current storylines in each episode. Evening soap operas and serials that run for only part of the year tend to bring things to a dramatic end-of-season cliffhanger.\n\nIn 1976, \"Time\" magazine described American daytime television as \"TV's richest market\", noting the loyalty of the soap opera fan base and the expansion of several half-hour series into hour-long broadcasts in order to maximize ad revenues. The article explained that at that time, many prime time series lost money, while daytime serials earned profits several times more than their production costs. The issue's cover notably featured its first daytime soap stars, Bill Hayes and Susan Seaforth Hayes of \"Days of Our Lives\", a married couple whose onscreen and real-life romance was widely covered by both the soap opera magazines and the mainstream press at large.\n\nThe first serial considered to be a \"soap opera\" was \"Painted Dreams\", which debuted on October 20, 1930 on Chicago radio station WGN. Early radio series such as \"Painted Dreams\" were broadcast in weekday daytime slots, usually five days a week. Most of the listeners would be housewives, thus, the shows were aimed at and consumed by, a predominantly female audience. The first nationally broadcast radio soap opera was \"Clara, Lu, and Em\", which aired on the NBC Blue Network at 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on January 27, 1931.\n\nThe main characteristics that define soap operas are \"an emphasis on family life, personal relationships, sexual dramas, emotional and moral conflicts; some coverage of topical issues; set in familiar domestic interiors with only occasional excursions into new locations\". Fitting in with these characteristics, most soap operas follow the lives of a group of characters who live or work in a particular place, or focus on a large extended family. The storylines follow the day-to-day activities and personal relationships of these characters. \"Soap narratives, like those of film melodramas, are marked by what Steve Neale has described as 'chance happenings, coincidences, missed meetings, sudden conversions, last-minute rescues and revelations, deus ex machina endings.'\" These elements may be found across the gamut of soap operas, from \"EastEnders\" to \"Dallas\".\n\nIn many soap operas, in particular daytime serials in the US, the characters are frequently attractive, seductive, glamorous and wealthy. Soap operas from the United Kingdom and Australia tend to focus on more everyday characters and situations, and are frequently set in working-class environments. Many of the soaps produced in those two countries explore social realist storylines such as family discord, marriage breakdown or financial problems. Both UK and Australian soap operas feature comedic elements, often affectionate comic stereotypes such as the gossip or the grumpy old man, presented as a comic foil to the emotional turmoil that surrounds them. This diverges from US soap operas where such comedy is rare. UK soap operas frequently make a claim to presenting \"reality\" or purport to have a \"realistic\" style. UK soap operas also frequently foreground their geographic location as a key defining feature of the show while depicting and capitalising on the exotic appeal of the stereotypes connected to the location. As examples, \"EastEnders\" focuses on the tough and grim life in the east end of London; \"Coronation Street\" and its characters exhibit the stereotypical characteristic of \"northern straight talking\".\n\nRomance, secret relationships, extramarital affairs, and genuine hate have been the basis for many soap opera storylines. In US daytime serials, the most popular soap opera characters, and the most popular storylines, often involved a romance of the sort presented in paperback romance novels. Soap opera storylines weave intricate, convoluted and sometimes confusing tales of characters who have affairs, meet mysterious strangers and fall in love, and who commit adultery, all of which keeps audiences hooked on the unfolding story. Crimes such as kidnapping, rape, and even murder may go unpunished if the perpetrator is to be retained in the ongoing story.\n\nAustralian and UK soap operas also feature a significant proportion of romance storylines. In Russia, most popular serials explore the \"romantic quality\" of criminal and/or oligarch life.\n\nIn soap opera storylines, previously unknown children, siblings and twins (including the evil variety) of established characters often emerge to upset and reinvigorate the set of relationships examined by the series. Unexpected calamities disrupt weddings, childbirths, and other major life events with unusual frequency.\n\nAs in comic books – another popular form of linear storytelling pioneered in the US during the 20th century – a character's death is not guaranteed to be permanent. On \"The Bold and the Beautiful\", Taylor Forrester (Hunter Tylo) was shown to flatline and have a funeral. When Tylo reprised the character in 2005, a retcon explained that Taylor had actually gone into a coma.\n\nStunts and complex physical action are largely absent, especially from daytime serials. Such story events often take place off screen and are referred to in dialogue instead of being shown. This is because stunts or action scenes are difficult to adequately depict without complex movements, multiple takes, and post production editing. When episodes were broadcast live, post production work was impossible. Though all serials have long switched to being taped, extensive post production work and multiple takes, while possible, are not feasible due to the tight taping schedules and low budgets.\n\nThe first daytime TV soap opera in the United States was \"These Are My Children\" in 1949, though earlier melodramas had aired in the evenings as once-a-week programs. Soap operas quickly became a fixture of American daytime television in the early 1950s, joined by game shows, sitcom reruns and talk shows.\n\nIn 1988, H. Wesley Kenney, who at the time served as the executive producer of \"General Hospital\", said to \"The New York Times\":\nMany long-running US soap operas established particular environments for their stories. \"The Doctors\" and \"General Hospital\", in the beginning, told stories almost exclusively from inside the confines of a hospital. \"As the World Turns\" dealt heavily with Chris Hughes' law practice and the travails of his wife Nancy who, tired of being \"the loyal housewife\" in the 1970s, became one of the first older women on the American serials to enter the workforce. \"Guiding Light\" dealt with Bert Bauer (Charita Bauer) and her alcoholic husband Bill, and their endless marital troubles. When Bert's status shifted to caring mother and town matriarch, her children's marital troubles were showcased. \"Search for Tomorrow\" mostly told its story through the eyes of Joanne Gardner (Mary Stuart). Even when stories revolved around other characters, Joanne was frequently a key player in their storylines. \"Days of Our Lives\" initially focused on Dr. Tom Horton and his steadfast wife Alice. The show later branched out to focus more on their five children. \"The Edge of Night\" featured as its central character Mike Karr, a police detective (later an attorney), and largely dealt with organized crime. \"The Young and the Restless\" first focused on two families, the prosperous Brooks family with four daughters, and the working class Foster family of a single working mother with three children. Its storylines explored realistic problems including cancer, mental illness, poverty, and infidelity.\n\nIn contrast, \"Dark Shadows\" (1966–1971), \"Port Charles\" (1997–2003) and \"Passions\" (1999-2008) featured supernatural characters and dealt with fantasy and horror storylines. Their characters included vampires, witches, ghosts, goblins, and angels.\n\nThe American soap opera \"Guiding Light\" (originally titled \"The Guiding Light\" until 1975) started as a radio drama in January 1937 and subsequently transferred to television in June 1952. With the exception of several years in the late 1940s, during which creator Irna Phillips was involved in a dispute with Procter & Gamble, \"Guiding Light\" was heard or seen nearly every weekday from 1937 until 2009, making it the longest story ever told in a broadcast medium.\n\nOriginally serials were broadcast as fifteen-minute installments each weekday in daytime slots. In 1956, \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Edge of Night\", both produced by Procter & Gamble Productions, debuted as the first half-hour soap operas on the CBS television network. All soap operas broadcast half-hour episodes by the end of the 1960s. With increased popularity in the 1970s, most soap operas had expanded to an hour in length by the end of the decade (\"Another World\" even expanded to 90 minutes for a short time). More than half of the serials had expanded to one-hour episodes by 1980. As of 2012, three of the four US serials air one-hour episodes each weekday; only \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" airs 30-minute episodes.\n\nSoap operas were originally broadcast live from the studio, creating what many at the time regarded as a feeling similar to that of a stage play. As nearly all soap operas were originated at that time in New York City, a number of soap actors were also accomplished stage actors who performed live theatre during breaks from their soap roles. In the 1960s and 1970s, new serials such as \"General Hospital\", \"Days of our Lives\" and \"The Young and the Restless\" were produced in Los Angeles. Their success made the West Coast a viable alternative to New York-produced soap operas, which were becoming more costly to perform. By the early 1970s, nearly all soap operas had transitioned to being taped. \"As the World Turns\" and \"The Edge of Night\" were the last to make the switch, in 1975.\n\n\"Port Charles\" used the practice of running 13-week \"story arcs,\" in which the main events of the arc are played out and wrapped up over the 13 weeks, although some storylines did continue over more than one arc. According to the 2006 Preview issue of \"Soap Opera Digest\", it was briefly discussed that all ABC shows might do telenovela arcs, but this was rejected.\n\nThough U.S. daytime soap operas are not generally rerun by their networks, occasionally they are rebroadcast elsewhere; CBS and ABC have made exceptions to this, airing older episodes (either those aired earlier in the current season or those aired years prior) on major holidays when special event programming is not scheduled. Early episodes of \"Dark Shadows\" were rerun on PBS member stations in the early 1970s after the show's cancellation, and the entire series (except for a single missing episode) was rerun on the Sci-Fi Channel in the 1990s. After \"The Edge of Night\"s 1984 cancellation, reruns of the show's final five years were shown late nights on USA Network from 1985 to 1989. On January 20, 2000, a digital cable and satellite network dedicated to the genre, SOAPnet, began re-airing soaps that originally aired on ABC, NBC and CBS.\n\nNewer broadcast networks since the late 1980s, such as Fox and cable television networks, have largely eschewed soap operas in their daytime schedules, instead running syndicated programming and reruns. No cable television outlet has produced its own daytime serial, although DirecTV's The 101 Network took over existing serial \"Passions\", continuing production for one season; while TBS and CBN Cable Network respectively aired their own soap operas, \"The Catlins\" (a primetime soap that utilized the daily episode format of its daytime counterparts) and \"Another Life\" (a soap that combined standard serial drama with religious overtones), during the 1980s. Fox, the fourth \"major network,\" carried a short lived daytime soap \"Tribes\" in 1990. Yet other than this and a couple of pilot attempts, Fox mainly stayed away from daytime soaps, and has not attempted them since their ascension to major-network status in 1994 (it did later attempt a series of daily prime time soaps, which aired on newly created sister network MyNetworkTV, but the experiment was largely a failure).\n\nDue to the masses of episodes produced for a series, release of soap operas to DVD (a popular venue for distribution of current and vintage television series) is considered impractical. With the exception of occasional specials, daytime soap operas are notable by their absence from DVD release schedules (an exception being the supernatural soap opera, \"Dark Shadows\", which did receive an essentially complete release on both VHS and DVD; the single lost episode #1219 is reconstructed by means of an off-the-air audio recording, still images, and recap material from adjacent episodes).\n\nDue to the longevity of these shows, it is not uncommon for a single character to be played by multiple actors. The key character of Mike Karr on \"The Edge of Night\" was played by three different actors.\n\nConversely, several actors have remained playing the same character for many years, or decades even. Helen Wagner played Hughes family matriarch Nancy Hughes on American soap \"As the World Turns\" from its April 2, 1956 debut through her death in May 2010. She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the actor with the longest uninterrupted performance in a single role. A number of performers played roles for twenty years or longer, occasionally on more than one show. Rachel Ames played Audrey Hardy on both \"General Hospital\" and \"Port Charles\" from 1964 until 2007, and returned in 2009. Susan Lucci played Erica Kane in \"All My Children\" from the show's debut in January 1970 until it ended its network television run on ABC on September 23, 2011. Erika Slezak played Victoria Lord #3 on \"One Life to Live\" from 1971 until the show ended its network television run on ABC on January 13, 2012 and resumed the role in its short-lived online revival on April 29, 2013.\n\nOther actors have played several characters on different shows. Millette Alexander, Bernard Barrow, Doris Belack, David Canary, Judith Chapman, Jordan Charney, Joan Copeland, Nicolas Coster, Jacqueline Courtney, Louis Edmonds, Dan Hamilton, Don Hastings, Vincent Irizarry, Lenore Kasdorf, Teri Keane, Lois Kibbee, John Loprieno, Maeve McGuire, James Mitchell, Christopher Pennock, Antony Ponzini, William Prince, Louise Shaffer, and Diana van der Vlis, among many others, have all played multiple soap roles.\n\nFor several decades, most daytime soap operas concentrated on family and marital discord, legal drama and romance. The action rarely left interior settings, and many shows were set in fictional, medium-sized Midwestern towns.\n\nExterior shots were slowly incorporated into the series \"The Edge of Night\" and \"Dark Shadows\". Unlike many earlier serials that were set in fictional towns, \"The Best of Everything\" and \"Ryan's Hope\" were set in a real-world location, New York City.\n\nThe first exotic location shoot was made by \"All My Children\", to St. Croix in 1978. Many other soap operas planned lavish storylines after the success of the \"All My Children\" shoot. Soap operas \"Another World\" and \"Guiding Light\" both went to St. Croix in 1980, the former show culminating a long-running storyline between popular characters Mac, Rachel and Janice, and the latter to serve as an exotic setting for Alan Spaulding and Rita Bauer's torrid affair. \"Search for Tomorrow\" taped for two weeks in Hong Kong in 1981. Later that year, some of the cast and crew ventured to Jamaica to tape a love consummation storyline between the characters of Garth and Kathy.\n\nDuring the 1980s, perhaps as a reaction to the evening drama series that were gaining high ratings, daytime serials began to incorporate action and adventure storylines, more big-business intrigue, and an increased emphasis on youthful romance.\n\nOne of the first and most popular couples was Luke Spencer and Laura Webber on \"General Hospital\". Luke and Laura helped to attract both male and female fans. Even actress Elizabeth Taylor was a fan and at her own request was given a guest role in Luke and Laura's wedding episode. Luke and Laura's popularity led to other soap producers striving to reproduce this success by attempting to create supercouples of their own.\n\nWith increasingly bizarre action storylines coming into vogue, Luke and Laura saved the world from being frozen, brought a mobster down by finding his black book in a Left-Handed Boy Statue, and helped a Princess find her Aztec Treasure in Mexico. Other soap operas attempted similar adventure storylines, often featuring footage shot on location – frequently in exotic locales.\n\nDuring the 1990s, the mob, action and adventure stories fell out of favor with producers, due to generally declining ratings for daytime soap operas at the time, and the resultant budget cuts. In addition, soap operas were no longer able to go on expensive location shoots overseas as they were able to do in the 1980s. During that decade, soap operas increasingly focused on younger characters and social issues, such as Erica Kane's drug addiction on \"All My Children\", the re-emergence of Viki Lord's multiple personality disorder on \"One Life to Live\", and Stuart Chandler dealing with his wife Cindy dying of AIDS on \"All My Children\". Other social issues included cancer, rape, abortion, homophobia, and racism.\n\nSome shows during the 2000s incorporated supernatural and science fiction elements into their storylines. One of the main characters on the earlier soap opera \"Dark Shadows\" was Barnabas Collins, a vampire, and \"One Life to Live\" featured an angel named Virgil. Both shows featured characters who traveled to and from the past.\n\nModern U.S. daytime soap operas largely stay true to the original soap opera format. The duration and format of storylines and the visual grammar employed by U.S. daytime serials set them apart from soap operas in other countries and from evening soap operas. Stylistically, UK and Australian soap operas, which are usually produced for early evening timeslots, fall somewhere in between U.S. daytime and evening soap operas. Similar to U.S. daytime soap operas, UK and Australian serials are shot on videotape, and the cast and storylines are rotated across the week's episodes so that each cast member will appear in some but not all episodes. UK and Australian soap operas move through storylines at a faster rate than daytime serials, making them closer to U.S. evening soap operas in this regard.\n\nAmerican daytime soap operas feature stylistic elements that set them apart from other shows:\n\nSoap opera ratings have significantly fallen in the U.S. since the 2000s. No new major daytime soap opera has been created since \"Passions\" in 1999, while many have been cancelled. Since January 2012, four daytime soap operas – \"General Hospital\", \"Days of Our Lives\", \"The Young and the Restless\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" – continue to air on the three major networks, down from a total of 12 during the 1990–91 season and a high of 19 in the 1969–70 season. This marks the first time since 1953 that there have been only four soap operas airing on broadcast television. \"The Young and the Restless\", the highest-rated soap opera from 1988 to the present, had fewer than 5 million daily viewers as of February 2012, a number exceeded by several non-scripted programs such as \"Judge Judy\". Circulations of soap opera magazines have decreased and some have even ceased publication. SOAPnet, which largely aired soap opera reruns, began to be phased out in 2012 and fully ceased operations the following year. The Daytime Emmy Awards, which honor soap operas and other daytime shows, moved from primetime network television to smaller cable channels in 2012, then failed to get any TV broadcast at all in 2014, 2016, and 2017.\n\nSeveral of the U.S.’s most established soaps ended between 2009 and 2012. The longest-running drama in television and radio history, \"Guiding Light\", barely reached 2.1 million daily viewers in 2009 and ended on September 18 of that year, after a 72-year run. \"As the World Turns\" aired its final episode on September 17, 2010 after a 54-year run. \"As the World Turns\" was the last of 20 soap operas produced by Procter & Gamble, the soap and consumer goods company from which the genre got its name. \"As The World Turns\" and \"Guiding Light\" were also among the last of the soaps that originated from New York City. \"All My Children\", another New York-based soap, moved its production out to Los Angeles in an effort to reduce costs and raise sagging ratings; however, both it and \"One Life to Live\", each with a four-decade-plus run, were cancelled in 2011. \"All My Children\" aired its network finale in September 2011 with \"One Life to Live\" following suit in January 2012. Both \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" were briefly revived online in 2013, before being canceled again that same year. In 2019, \"Days of Our Lives\" was put on \"indefinite hiatus\" and all of the cast's contracts were terminated.\n\nAs women increasingly worked outside of the home, daytime television viewing declined. New generations of potential viewers were not raised watching soap operas with their mothers, leaving the shows' long and complex storylines foreign to younger audiences. Now, as viewers age, ratings continue to drop among young adult women, the demographic group that soap opera advertisers pay the most for. Those who might watch in workplace breakrooms are not counted, as Nielsen does not track television viewing outside the home. The rise of cable and the internet has also provided new sources of entertainment during the day. The genre's decline has additionally been attributed to reality television displacing soap operas as TV's dominant form of melodrama. An early term for the reality TV genre was \"docu-soap\". A precursor to reality TV, the televised 1994–95 O. J. Simpson murder case, both preempted and competed with an entire season of soaps, transforming viewing habits and leaving soap operas with 10 percent fewer viewers after the trial ended.\n\nDaytime programming alternatives such as talk shows, game shows, and court shows cost up to 50% less to produce than scripted dramas, making those formats more profitable and attractive to networks, even if they receive the same or slightly lower ratings than soap operas. A network may even prefer to return a timeslot to its local stations to keeping a soap opera with disappointing ratings on the air, as was the case with \"Sunset Beach\" and \"Port Charles\". Compounding the financial pressure on scripted programming in the 2007–2010 period was a decline in advertising during the Great Recession, which led shows to reduce their budgets and cast sizes. In addition to these external factors, a litany of production decisions has been cited by soap opera fans as contributing to the genre's decline, such as cliched plots, a lack of diversity that narrowed audience appeal, and the elimination of core families.\n\nSerials produced for primetime slots have also found success. The first primetime soap opera was \"Faraway Hill\" (1946), which aired on October 2, 1946, on the now-defunct DuMont Television Network. \"Faraway Hill\" ran for 12 episodes and was primarily broadcast live, interspersed with short pre-recorded film clips and still photos to remind the audience of the previous week's episode.\n\nThe first long-running prime time soap opera was \"Peyton Place\" (1964–1969) on ABC. It was based in part on the eponymous 1957 film (which, in turn, was based on the 1956 novel).\n\nThe popularity of \"Peyton Place\" prompted the CBS network to spin-off popular \"As the World Turns\" character Lisa Miller into her own evening soap opera, \"Our Private World\" (originally titled \"The Woman Lisa\" in its planning stages). \"Our Private World\" was broadcast from May to September 1965. The character of Lisa (and her portrayer Eileen Fulton) returned to \"As The World Turns\" after the series ended.\n\nThe structure of \"Peyton Place\", with its episodic plots and long-running story arcs, set the mold for the primetime serials of the 1980s when the format reached its pinnacle.\n\nThe successful primetime serials of the 1980s included \"Dallas\", \"Dynasty\", \"Knots Landing\" and \"Falcon Crest\". These shows frequently dealt with wealthy families, and their personal and big-business travails. Common characteristics were sumptuous sets and costumes, complex storylines examining business schemes and intrigue, and spectacular disaster cliffhanger situations. Each of these series featured a wealthy, domineering, promiscuous, and passionate antagonist as a key character in the storyline – respectively, J. R. Ewing, Alexis Colby, Abby Cunningham and Angela Channing. These villainous schemers became immensely popular figures that audiences \"loved to hate\".\n\nUnlike daytime serials, which are shot on video in a studio using the multi-camera setup, these evening series were shot on film using a single camera setup, and featured substantial location-shot footage, often in picturesque locales. \"Dallas\", its spin-off \"Knots Landing\", and \"Falcon Crest\" all initially featured episodes with self-contained stories and specific guest stars who appeared in just that episode. Each story was completely resolved by the end of the episode, and there were no end-of-episode cliffhangers. After the first couple of seasons, all three shows changed their story format to that of a pure soap opera, with interwoven ongoing narratives that ran over several episodes. \"Dynasty\" featured this format throughout its run.\n\nThe soap opera's distinctive open plot structure and complex continuity was increasingly incorporated into American primetime television programs of the period. The first significant drama series to do this was \"Hill Street Blues\". This series, produced by Steven Bochco, featured many elements borrowed from soap operas, such as an ensemble cast, multi-episode storylines, and extensive character development over the course of the series. It and the later \"Cagney & Lacey\" overlaid the police series formula with ongoing narratives exploring the personal lives and interpersonal relationships of the regular characters. The success of these series prompted other drama series, such as \"St. Elsewhere\" and situation comedy series, to incorporate serialized stories and story structure to varying degrees.\n\nThe primetime soap operas and drama series of the 1990s, such as \"Beverly Hills, 90210\", \"Melrose Place\", \"Party of Five\", \"The OC\", and \"Dawson's Creek\", focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as \"Desperate Housewives\", \"Grey's Anatomy\", \"Brothers & Sisters\", \"Ugly Betty\", \"Private Practice\", and more recently \"Revenge\", \"Nashville\", \"Scandal\", \"Mistresses\", and formerly \"Ringer\", which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including \"Heroes\" and \"Friday Night Lights\". The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line of primetime telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.\n\nOn June 13, 2012, \"Dallas\", a continuation of the 1978 original series premiered on the cable network, TNT. The revived series, which was canceled after three seasons in 2014, delivered solid ratings for the channel, only losing viewership after the show's most established star, Larry Hagman, died midway through the series. In 2012, Nick at Nite debuted a primetime soap opera, \"Hollywood Heights\", which aired episodes five nights a week (on Monday through Fridays) in a manner similar to a daytime soap opera, instead of the once-a-week episode output common of other primetime soaps. The series, which was an adaptation of the Mexican telenovela \"Alcanzar una estrella\", suffered from low ratings (generally receiving less than one million viewers) and was later moved to sister cable channel TeenNick halfway through its run to burn off the remaining episodes.\n\nIn 2015, Fox debuted \"Empire\", a primetime musical serial centering on the power struggle between family members within the titular recording company. Created by Lee Daniels and Danny Strong and led by Oscar nominees Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson, the drama premiered to high ratings. The show is strongly influenced by other works such as William Shakespeare's \"King Lear\", James Goldman's \"The Lion in Winter\" and the 1980s soap opera \"Dynasty\". Also in 2015, E! introduced \"The Royals\", a series following the life and drama of a fictional English Royal family, which was also inspired by \"Dynasty\" (even featuring Joan Collins as the Queen's mother). In addition, ABC debuted a primetime soap opera \"Blood & Oil\", following a young couple looking to make money off the modern-day Williston oil boom, premiering on September 27, 2015 during the 2015-16 TV season.\n\nThe telenovela, a shorter-form format of serial melodrama, shares some thematic and especially stylistic similarity to the soap opera, enough that the colloquialism \"Spanish soap opera\" has arisen to describe the format. The chief difference between the two is length of series; while soap operas usually have indefinite runs, telenovelas typically have a central story arc with a prescribed ending within a year or two of the show's launch, requiring more concise storytelling.\n\nSpanish-language networks, chiefly Univision and Telemundo, have found success airing telenovelas for the growing U.S. Hispanic market. Both originally produced and imported Latin American dramas are popular features of the networks' daytime and primetime lineups, sometimes beating English-language networks in the ratings.\n\nSome web series are soap operas, such as \"\" or \"\". In 2013, production company Prospect Park revived \"All My Children\" and \"One Life to Live\" for the web, retaining original creator Agnes Nixon as a consultant and keeping many of the same actors (Prospect Park purchased the rights to both series months after their cancellations by ABC in 2011, although it initially suspended plans to relaunch the soaps later that same year due to issues receiving approval from acting and production unions). Each show initially produced four half-hour episodes a week, but quickly cut back to two half-hour episodes each. In the midst of (though not directly related to) a lawsuit between Prospect Park and ABC, the experiment ended that same year, with both shows being canceled again.\n\nAs of 2017, Turkey is the second largest exporter of television soap operas. In 2016, Turkish TV exports earned $350 million, making it the second largest drama exporter in the world behind the United States. Turkish soap operas have a large following across Asia, the Balkans, Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nSoap operas in the UK began on radio and consequently were associated with the BBC. It had resisted soaps as antithetical to its quality image, but began broadcasting \"Front Line Family\" in April 1941 on its North American shortwave service to encourage American intervention on Britain's behalf in World War II. The BBC continues to broadcast the world's longest-running radio soap, \"The Archers\", which first aired in May 1950, and has been running nationally since 1951. It is currently broadcast on BBC Radio 4 and continues to attract over five million listeners, or roughly 25% of the radio listening population of the UK at that time of the evening.\n\nIn the UK, soap operas are one of the most popular genres, with most being broadcast during prime time. Most UK soap operas focus on everyday, working-class communities, influenced by the conventions of the kitchen sink drama. The most popular British soap operas are \"EastEnders\", \"Coronation Street\", \"Emmerdale\", \"Hollyoaks\", \"Doctors\", and the Australian produced \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\". The first three of these are consistently among the highest-rated shows on British television. Such is the magnitude of the popularity of the soap genre in the UK that all television serials in the country are reputedly enjoyed by members of the British Royal Family, including Elizabeth II herself. Major events in British culture are often mentioned in the storyline, such as England's participation at the World Cup, and the death of Princess Diana. Since 1999, The British Soap Awards has been televised on ITV.\n\nThe 1986 Christmas Day episode of \"EastEnders\" is often referred to as the highest-rated UK soap opera episode ever, with 30.15 million viewers (more than half the population at the time). The figure of 30.15 million was actually a combination of the original broadcast, which had just over 19 million viewers, and the Sunday omnibus edition with 10 million viewers. The combined 30.15 million audience figure makes the aforementioned Christmas Day 1986 episode of \"EastEnders\" the highest-rated single-channel broadcast in the history of UK television. Overall it ranks third behind the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final (32.3 million viewers) and Princess Diana's funeral in 1997 (32.1 million viewers) which were transmitted on both BBC One and ITV.\n\nAn early television serial was \"The Grove Family\" on the BBC, which produced 148 episodes from 1954 to 1957. The programme was broadcast live and only a handful of recordings were retained in the archives. The UK's first twice-weekly serial was ITV's \"Emergency - Ward 10\", running from 1957 until 1967.\n\nIn the 1960s, \"Coronation Street\" revolutionised UK television and quickly became a British institution. On 17 September 2010, it became the world's longest-running television soap opera and was listed in \"Guinness World Records\". The BBC also produced several serials: \"Compact\" was about the staff of a women's magazine; \"The Newcomers\" was about the upheaval caused by a large firm setting up a plant in a small town; \"United!\" contained 147 episodes and focused on a football team; \"199 Park Lane\" (1965) was an upper class serial, which ran for only 18 episodes. None of these serials came close to making the same impact as \"Coronation Street\". Indeed, most of the 1960s BBC serials were largely wiped.\n\nDuring the 1960s, \"Coronation Street\"s main rival was \"Crossroads\", a daily serial that began in 1964 and aired on ITV in the early evening. \"Crossroads\" was set in a Birmingham motel and, although the program was popular, its purported low technical standard and bad acting were much mocked. By the 1980s, its ratings had begun to decline. Several attempts to revamp the program through cast changes and, later, expanding the focus from the motel to the surrounding community were unsuccessful. \"Crossroads\" was cancelled in 1988 (a new version of \"Crossroads\" was later produced, running from 2001 until 2003).\n\nA later rival to \"Coronation Street\" was ITV's \"Emmerdale Farm\" (later renamed \"Emmerdale\"), which began in 1972 in a daytime slot and was set in rural Yorkshire. Increased viewership resulted in \"Emmerdale\" being moved to a prime-time slot in the 1980s.\n\n\"Pobol y Cwm\" (\"People of the Valley\") is a Welsh language serial that has been produced by the BBC since October 1974, and is the longest-running television soap opera produced by the broadcaster. \"Pobol y Cwm\" was originally broadcast on BBC Wales television from 1974 to 1982; it was then moved to the Welsh-language television station S4C when it opened in November 1982. The program was occasionally shown on BBC1 in London during periods of regional optout in the mid- to late 1970s. \"Pobol y Cwm\" was briefly shown in the rest of the UK in 1994 on BBC2, with English subtitles; it is consistently the most watched programme each week on S4C.\n\nDaytime soap operas were non-existent until the 1970s because there was virtually no daytime television in the UK. ITV introduced \"General Hospital\", which later moved to a prime time slot. In 1980, Scottish Television debuted \"Take the High Road\", which lasted for over twenty years. Later, daytime slots were filled with an influx of Australian soap operas such as \"The Sullivans\" (aired on ITV from 1977), \"The Young Doctors\" (from 1982), \"Sons and Daughters\" (from 1983), \"A Country Practice\" (from 1982), \"Richmond Hill\" (from 1988 to 1989) and eventually, \"Neighbours\" was acquired by the BBC in 1986, and \"Home and Away\" aired on ITV beginning in 1989. These achieved significant levels of popularity; \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" were moved to early-evening slots, helping begin the UK soap opera boom in the late 1980s.\n\nThe day Channel 4 began operations in 1982 it launched its own soap, the Liverpool-based \"Brookside\", which would redefine soaps over the next decade. The focus of \"Brookside\" was different from earlier soap operas in the UK; it was set in a middle-class new-build cul-de-sac, unlike \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale Farm\", which were set in established working-class communities. The characters in \"Brookside\" were generally either people who had advanced themselves from inner-city council estates, or the upper middle-class who had fallen on hard times. Though \"Brookside\" was still broadcast in a pre-watershed slot (8.00 p.m. and 8.30 p.m. on weekdays, around 5.00 p.m. for the omnibus on Saturdays), it was more liberal than other soaps of the time: the dialogue regularly included expletives. This stemmed from the overall more liberal policy of the channel during that period. The soap was also heavily politicised. Bobby Grant (Ricky Tomlinson), a militant trade-unionist anti-hero, was the most overtly political character. Storylines were often more sensationalist than on other soaps (throughout the soap's history, there were two armed sieges on the street) and were staged with more violence (particularly, rape) often being featured.\n\nIn 1985, the BBC's \"EastEnders\" debuted and became a near instant success with viewers and critics alike, with the first episode attracting over 17 million viewers. The Christmas Day 1986 episode was watched by 30.15 million viewers and contained a scene in which divorce papers were served to Angie Watts (Anita Dobson) by her husband, Queen Vic landlord Den (Leslie Grantham).\n\nA notable success in pioneering late-night broadcasting, in October 1984, Yorkshire Television began airing the cult Australian soap opera \"Prisoner\", which originally ran from 1979 to 1986. It was eventually broadcast on all regions of the UK in differing slots, usually around 23:00 (but never before 22:30 in any region), under the title \"Prisoner: Cell Block H\". It was probably most popular in the Midlands where Central Television consistently broadcast the serial three times a week from 1987 to 1991. Its airing in the UK was staggered, so different regions of the country saw it at a different pace. The program was immensely successful, regularly achieving 10 million viewers when all regions' ratings per episode were added together. Central bowed to fan pressure to repeat the soap, of which the first 95 episodes aired. Then, rival station Channel 5 also acquired rights to repeat the entire rerun of the program, starting in 1997. All 692 episodes have since been released on DVD in the UK.\n\nIn 1992, the BBC made \"Eldorado\" to daily alternate with \"EastEnders\". The programme was heavily criticised and only lasted one year. Nevertheless, soap operas gained increasing prominence on UK television schedules. In 1995, Channel 4 premiered \"Hollyoaks\", a soap with a youth focus. When Channel 5 launched in March 1997, it debuted the soap opera \"Family Affairs\", which was formatted as a week-daily soap, airing Monday through Fridays.\n\n\"Brookside\"s premise evolved during the 1990s, phasing out the politicised stories of the 1980s and shifting the emphasis to controversial and sensationalist stories such as child rape, sibling incest, religious cults and drug addiction, including the infamous 'body under the patio' storyline that ran from 1993 to 1995, and gave the serial its highest ratings ever with 9 million viewers.\n\n\"Coronation Street\" and \"Brookside\" began releasing straight-to-video features. The \"Coronation Street\" releases generally kept the pace and style of conventional programs episodes with the action set in foreign locations. The \"Brookside\" releases were set in the usual locations, but featured stories with adult content not allowed on television pre-watershed, with these releases given '18' certificates.\n\n\"Emmerdale Farm\" was renamed \"Emmerdale\" in 1989. The series was revamped in 1993 with many changes executed via the crash of a passenger jet that partially destroyed the village and killed several characters. This attracted criticism as it was broadcast near the fifth anniversary of the Lockerbie bombing. The storyline drew the soap its highest ever audience of 18 million viewers. The revamp was a success and \"Emmerdale\" grew in popularity.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, \"Brookside\", \"Coronation Street\", \"EastEnders\" and \"Emmerdale\" continued to flourish. Each increased the number of episodes that aired on a weekly basis by at least one, further defining soap operas as the leading genre in British television.\n\nSince 2000, new soap operas have continued to be developed. Daytime drama \"Doctors\" began in March 2000, preceding \"Neighbours\" on BBC One. In 2002, as ratings for the Scottish serial \"High Road\" (formerly \"Take The High Road\") continued to decline, BBC Scotland launched \"River City\", which proved popular and effectively replaced \"High Road\" when it was cancelled in 2003. The long-running serial \"Brookside\" ended in November 2003 after 21 years on the air, leaving \"Hollyoaks\" as Channel 4's flagship serial.\n\nA new version of \"Crossroads\" featuring a mostly new cast was produced by Carlton Television for ITV in 2001. It did not achieve high ratings and was cancelled in 2003. In 2001, ITV also launched a new early-evening serial entitled \"Night and Day\". This program too attracted low viewership and, after being shifted to a late night time slot, was cancelled in 2003. \"Family Affairs\", which was broadcast opposite the racier \"Hollyoaks\", never achieved significantly high ratings leading to several dramatic casting revamps and marked changes in style and even location over its run. By 2004, \"Family Affairs\" had a larger fan base and won its first awards, but was cancelled in late 2005.\n\nIn 2008, ITV premiered \"The Royal Today\", a daily spin-off of popular 1960s-based drama \"The Royal\", which had been running in a primetime slot since 2002. Just days later, soap opera parody programs \"Echo Beach\" premiered alongside its sister show, the comedy \"Moving Wallpaper\". Both \"Echo Beach\" and \"The Royal Today\" ended after just one series due to low ratings. Radio soap opera \"Silver Street\" debuted on the BBC Asian Network in 2004. Poor ratings and criticism of the program led to its cancellation in 2010.\n\nUK soap operas for many years usually only aired two nights a week. The exception was the original \"Crossroads\", which began as a week-daily soap opera in the 1960s, but later had its number of weekly broadcasts reduced.\n\nIn 1989 \"Coronation Street\" began airing three times a week. In 1996 it expanded to four episodes a week.\n\n\"Brookside\" premiered in 1982 with two episodes a week. In 1990 it expanded to three episodes a week.\n\n\"EastEnders\" increased its number of episode a week in 1994 and \"Emmerdale\" did so in 1997.\n\n\"Family Affairs\" debuted as a weekdaily soap in 1997, producing five episodes a week its entire run.\n\nIn 2004, \"Emmerdale\" began airing six episodes a week.\n\nIn a January 2008 overhaul of the ITV network, the Sunday episodes of \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" were moved out of their slots. \"Coronation Street\" added a second episode on Friday evenings at 8:30 p.m. \"Emmerdale\"s Tuesday edition was extended to an hour, putting it in direct competition with \"EastEnders\". In July 2009, the schedules of these serials were changed again. On 23 July 2009, \"Coronation Street\" moved from the Wednesday slot it held for 49 years, to Thursday evenings. \"Emmerdale\" reverted to running just one 30-minute episode on Tuesday evenings and the other 30-minute installment was moved to Thursday evenings. \"Coronation Street\" later returned to a Wednesday slot, to air Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 19:30 and 20:30. \"Emmerdale\" airs at 19:00 every weeknight, and 20:00 on Thursdays.\n\nLater, \"Coronation Street\" (which began airing two episodes on Monday nights in 2002) produced five episodes a week.\n\nIt was announced in June 2016 that starting late 2017, Coronation Street would air six episodes a week.\n\n\"Doctors\" airs five episodes a week, and is the only soap without a weekend omnibus repeat screening. \"Hollyoaks\" produces five episodes a week. The imported \"Neighbours\" screens as five new episodes a week. As of 2019, \"EastEnders\" produces four episode a week.\n\nUK soap operas are shot on videotape in the studio using a multi-camera setup. In their early years \"Coronation Street\" and \"Emmerdale\" used 16 mm film for footage shot on location. Since the 1980s UK soap opera have routinely featured scenes shot outdoors in each episode. This footage is shot on videotape on a purpose-built outdoor set that represents the community that the soap focuses on.\n\n\"Hollyoaks\" and \"Family Affairs\" were taped on high-definition video, and used the filmizing process.\n\nAustralia has had quite a number of well-known soap operas, some of which have gained cult followings in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and other countries. The majority of Australian television soap operas are produced for early evening or evening timeslots. They usually produce two or two-and-a-half hours of new material each week, either arranged as four or five half-hour episodes a week, or as two one-hour episodes.\n\nStylistically, these series most closely resemble UK soap operas in that they are nearly always shot on videotape, are mainly recorded in a studio and use a multi-camera setup. The original Australian serials were shot entirely in-studio. During the 1970s occasional filmed inserts were used to incorporate sequences shot outdoors. Outdoor shooting later became commonplace and starting in the late 1970s, it became standard practice for some on-location footage to be featured in each episode of any Australian soap opera, often to capitalise on the attractiveness and exotic nature of these locations for international audiences. Most Australian soap operas focus on a mixed age range of middle-class characters and will regularly feature a range of locations where the various, disparate characters can meet and interact, such as the café, the surf club, the wine bar or the school.\n\nThe genre began in Australia on radio, as it had in the United States and the United Kingdom. One such radio serial, \"Big Sister\", featured actress Thelma Scott in the cast and aired nationally for five years beginning in 1942. Probably the best known Australian radio serial was the long-running soap opera \"Blue Hills\", which was created by Gwen Meredith and ran from 1949 to 1976. With the advent of Australian television in 1956, daytime television serials followed. The first Australian television soap opera was \"Autumn Affair\" (1958) featuring radio personality and \"Blue Hills\" star Queenie Ashton making the transition to television. Each episode of this serial ran for 15 minutes and aired each weekday on the Seven Network. \"Autumn Affair\" failed to secure a sponsor and ended in 1959 after 156 episodes. It was followed by \"The Story of Peter Grey\" (1961), another Seven Network weekday series aired in a daytime slot in 15-minute installments. \"The Story of Peter Grey\" ran for 164 episodes.\n\nThe first successful wave of Australian evening television soap operas started in 1967 with \"Bellbird\", produced by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This rural-based serial screened in an early evening slot in 15-minute installments as a lead-in to the evening news. \"Bellbird\" was a moderate success but built-up a consistent and loyal viewer base, especially in rural areas, and enjoyed a ten-year run. \"Motel\" (1968) was Australia's first half-hour soap opera; the daytime soap had a short run of 132 episodes.\n\nThe first major soap opera hit in Australia was the sex-melodrama \"Number 96\", a nighttime series produced by Cash Harmon Television for Network Ten, which debuted March 1972. The program dealt with such topics as homosexuality, adultery, drug use, rape-within-marriage and racism, which had rarely been explored on Australian television programs before. The series became famous for its sex scenes and nudity and for its comedic characters, many of whom became cult heroes in Australia. By 1973, \"Number 96\" had become Australia's highest-rated show. In 1974, the sexed-up antics of \"Number 96\" prompted the creation of \"The Box\", which rivaled it in terms of nudity and sexual situations and was scheduled in a nighttime slot. Produced by Crawford Productions, many critics considered \"The Box\" to be a more slickly produced and better written show than \"Number 96\". \"The Box\" also aired on the Ten Network, programmed to run right after \"Number 96\". For 1974 \"Number 96\" was again the highest rating show on Australian television, and that year \"The Box\" occupied the number two spot.\n\nAlso in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created its first soap opera, and significantly Australia's first \"teen\" soap opera, \"Class of '74\". With its attempts to hint at the sex and sin shown more openly on \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", its high school setting and early evening timeslot, \"Class of '74\" came under intense scrutiny from the Broadcasting Control Board, who vetted scripts and altered entire storylines.\n\nBy 1975, both \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", perhaps as a reaction to declining ratings for both shows, de-emphasised the sex and nudity shifting more towards comedic plots. \"Class of '74\" was renamed \"Class of '75\" and also added more slapstick comedy for its second year, but the revamped show's ratings declined, resulting in its cancellation in mid-1975. That year Cash Harmon's newly launched second soap \"The Unisexers\" failed in its early evening slot and was cancelled after three weeks; the Reg Grundy Organisation's second soap \"Until Tomorrow\" ran in a daytime slot for 180 episodes.\n\nA feature film version of \"Bellbird\" entitled \"Country Town\" was produced in 1971 by two of the show's stars, Gary Gray and Terry McDermott, without production involvement by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" also released feature film versions, both of which had the same title as the series, released in 1974 and 1975 respectively. As Australian television had broadcast in black and white until 1975, these theatrical releases all had the novelty of being in colour. The film versions of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" also allowed more explicit nudity than could be shown on television at that time.\n\nIn November 1976 \"The Young Doctors\" debuted on the Nine Network. This Grundy Organization series eschewed the adult drama of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", focusing more on relationship drama and romance. It became a popular success but received few critical accolades. A week later \"The Sullivans\", a carefully produced period serial chronicling the effects of World War II on a Melbourne family, also debuted on Nine. Produced by Crawford Productions, \"The Sullivans\" became a ratings success, attracted many positive reviews, and won television awards. During this period \"Number 96\" re-introduced nudity into its episodes, with several much-publicised full-frontal nude scenes, a cast revamp and a new range of shock storylines designed to boost the show's declining ratings. \"Bellbird\" experienced changes to its broadcast pattern with episodes screening in 60 minute blocks, and later in 30 minute installments.\n\"Bellbird\", \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\", which had been experiencing declining ratings, were cancelled in 1977. Various attempts to revamp each of the shows with cast reshuffles or spectacular disaster storylines had proved only temporarily successful. \"The Young Doctors\" and \"The Sullivans\" continued to be popular. November 1977 saw the launch of successful soap opera/police procedural series \"Cop Shop\" (1977–1984) produced by Crawford Productions for Channel Seven. In early December 1977 Channel Ten debuted the Reg Grundy Organisation produced \"The Restless Years\" (1977–1981), a more standard soap drama focusing on several young school leavers.\n\nThe Seven Network, achieving success with \"Cop Shop\" produced by Crawford Productions, had Crawfords produce \"Skyways\", a series with a similar format but set in an airport, to compete with the Nine Network's popular talk show \"The Don Lane Show\". \"Skyways\", which debuted in July 1979, emphasised adult situations including homosexuality, marriage problems, adultery, prostitution, drug use and smuggling, crime, suicide, political intrigue, and murder, and featured some nudity. Despite this, the program achieved only moderate ratings and was cancelled in mid-1981.\n\nThe Reg Grundy Organisation found major success with the women's-prison drama \"Prisoner\" (1979–1986) on Network Ten, and melodramatic family saga \"Sons and Daughters\" (1982–1987) on the Seven Network. Both shows achieved high ratings in their original runs, and unusually, found success in repeats after the programs ended.\n\nGrundy soap \"The Young Doctors\" and Crawford Productions' \"The Sullivans\" continued on the Nine Network until late 1982. Thereafter Nine attempted many new replacement soap operas produced by the Reg Grundy Organisation: \"Taurus Rising\" (1982), \"Waterloo Station\" (1983), \"Starting Out\" (1983) and \"Possession\" (1985), along with \"Prime Time\" (1986) produced by Crawford Productions. None of these programs were successful and most were cancelled after only a few months. The Reg Grundy Organisation also created \"Neighbours\", a suburban-based daily serial devised as a sedate family drama with some comedic and lightweight situations, for the Seven Network in 1985.\n\nProduced in Melbourne at the studios of HSV-7, \"Neighbours\" achieved high ratings in Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide, but not in Sydney, where it aired at 5.30 p.m. placing it against the hit dating game show \"Perfect Match\" on Channel 10. The Seven Network's Sydney station ATN-7 quickly lost interest in \"Neighbours\" as a result of the low ratings in Sydney. HSV-7 in Melbourne lobbied heavily to keep \"Neighbours\" on the air, but ATN-7 managed to convince the rest of the network to cancel the show and instead keep ATN-7's own Sydney-based dramas \"A Country Practice\" and \"Sons and Daughters\".\n\nAfter the network cancelled \"Neighbours\", it was immediately picked up by Channel Ten, which revamped the cast and scripts slightly and aired the series in the 7.00 p.m. slot starting 20 January 1986. It initially attracted low audiences, however after a concerted publicity drive, Ten managed to transform the series into a major success, turning several of its actors into major international stars. The show's popularity eventually declined and it was moved to the 6.30 p.m. slot in 1992. In January 2011 it moved to Eleven and is Australia's longest-running soap opera.\n\nThe success of \"Neighbours\" in the 1980s prompted the creation of somewhat similar suburban and family or teen-oriented soap operas such as \"Home and Away\" (1988–present) on Channel Seven and \"Richmond Hill\" (1988) on Channel Ten. Both proved popular, however \"Richmond Hill\" emerged as only a moderate success and was cancelled after one year to be replaced on Ten by \"E Street\" (1989–1993).\n\nNine continued trying to establish a successful new soap opera, without success. After the failure of family drama \"Family and Friends\" in 1990, it launched the raunchier and more extreme \"Chances\" in 1991, which resurrected the sex and melodrama of \"Number 96\" and \"The Box\" in an attempt to attract attention. \"Chances\" achieved only moderate ratings, and was moved to a late-night timeslot. It underwent several revamps that removed much of the original cast, and refocused the storylines to incorporate science-fiction and fantasy elements. The series continued in a late night slot until 1992, when it was cancelled due to low ratings despite the much-discussed fantasy storylines.\n\nSeveral Australian soap operas have also found significant international success. In the UK, starting in the mid-1980s, daytime broadcasts of \"The Young Doctors\", \"The Sullivans\", \"Sons and Daughters\" and \"Neighbours\" (which itself was subsequently moved to an early-evening slot) achieved significant success. Grundy's \"Prisoner\" began airing in the United States in 1979 and achieved high ratings in many regions there, however the show ended its run in that country three years into its run. \"Prisoner\" also aired in late-night timeslots in the UK beginning in the late 1980s, achieving enduring cult success there. The show became so popular in that country that it prompted the creation of two stage plays and a stage musical based on the show, all of which toured the UK, among many other spin-offs. In the late 1990s, Channel 5 repeated \"Prisoner\" in the UK. Between 1998 and 2005, Channel 5 ran late-night repeats of \"Sons and Daughters\". During the 1980s, the Australian attempts to emulate big-budget U.S. soap operas such as \"Dallas\" and \"Dynasty\" had resulted in the debuts of \"Taurus Rising\" and \"Return to Eden\", two slick soap opera dramas with big budgets that were shot entirely on film. Though their middling Australian ratings resulted in the shows running only for a single season, both programs were successfully sold internationally.\n\nOther shows to achieve varying levels of international success include \"Richmond Hill\", \"E Street\", \"Paradise Beach\" (1993–1994), and \"Pacific Drive\" (1995–1997). Indeed, these last two series were designed specifically for international distribution. Channel Seven's \"Home and Away\", a teen soap developed as a rival to \"Neighbours\", has also achieved significant and enduring success on UK television.\n\n\"Something in the Air\", a serial examining a range of characters in a small country town ran on the ABC from 2000 to 2002.\n\nAttempts to replicate the success of daily teen-oriented serials \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" saw the creation of \"Echo Point\" (1995) and \"Breakers\" (1999) on Network Ten. These programs foregrounded youthful attractive casts and appealing locations but the programs were not long-running successes and \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" remained the most visible and consistently successful Australian soap operas in production. In their home country, they both attracted respectable although not spectacular ratings in the early 2000s. By 2004, \"Neighbours\" was regularly attracting just under a million viewers per episode – considered at that time a low figure for Australian prime time television. By March 2007, the Australian audience for \"Neighbours\" had fallen to fewer than 700,000 a night. This prompted a revamp of the show's cast, its visual presentation, and a move away from the recently added action-oriented emphasis to refocus the show on the domestic storylines it is traditionally known for. During this period \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" continued to achieve significant ratings in the UK. This and other lucrative overseas markets, along with Australian broadcasting laws that enforce a minimum amount of domestic drama production on commercial television networks, help ensure that both programs remain in production. Both shows get higher total ratings in the UK than in Australia (the UK has three times the total population of Australia) and the UK channels make a major contribution to the production costs.\n\nIt has been suggested that with their emphasis on the younger, attractive and charismatic characters, \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" have found success in the middle ground between glamorous, fantastic U.S. soaps with their wealthy but tragic heroes and the more grim, naturalistic UK soap operas populated by older, unglamorous characters. The casts of \"Neighbours\" and \"Home and Away\" are predominantly younger and more attractive than the casts of UK soaps, and without excessive wealth and glamour of the U.S. daytime serial, a middle-ground in which they have found their lucrative niche.\n\n\"Neighbours\" was carried in the United States on the Oxygen cable channel in March 2004; however it attracted few viewers, perhaps in part due to its scheduling opposite well-established and highly popular U.S. soap operas such as \"All My Children\" and \"The Young and the Restless\", and was dropped by the network shortly afterwards due to low ratings.\n\n\"headLand\" made its debut on Channel Seven in November 2005, the series arose out of a proposed spinoff of \"Home and Away\" that was to have been produced in conjunction with \"Home and Away\"s UK broadcaster, Five. The idea for the spin-off was scuttled after Five pulled out of the deal, which meant that the show could potentially air on a rival channel in the UK; as such, Five requested that the new show be developed as a standalone series and not be spun off from a series that it owned a stake in. The series premiered in Australia on November 15, 2005, but was not a ratings success and was cancelled two months later on January 23, 2006. The series broadcast on E4 and Channel 4 in the UK. Nickelodeon's \"\" appeared on July 2006 on Network Ten. Since Connie considered this mention as a torrid soap opera, this was mentioned in the Steven Universe episode \"Love Letters\".\n\nAfter losing the UK television rights to \"Neighbours\" to Five, the BBC commissioned a replacement serial \"Out of the Blue\", which was produced in Australia. It debuted as part of BBC One's weekday afternoon schedule on 28 April 2008 but low ratings prompted its move to BBC Two on 19 May 2008. The series was cancelled after its first season.\n\n\"Neighbours\"' continued low ratings in Australia resulted in it being moved to Ten's new digital channel, Eleven on January 11, 2011. However, it continues to achieve reasonable ratings on Channel 5 in the United Kingdom, and as of March 2013 still reportedly achieved significant international sales.\n\nPioneering series \"Pukemanu\" aired over two years (1971–72) and was the NZBC's first continuing drama. It followed the goings-on of a North Island timber town.\n\"Close to Home\" is a New Zealand television soap opera that ran on TVNZ 1 from 1975 to 1983. At its peak in 1977 nearly one million viewers tuned in twice weekly to watch the series co-created by Michael Noonan and Tony Isaac (who had initially only agreed to make the show on the condition they would get to make \"The Governor\"). \"Gloss\" is a television drama series that screened from 1987 to 1990. The series is about a fictional publishing empire run by the Redfern family. Gloss was NZ's answer to US soap \"Dynasty\", with the Carrington oil scions replaced by the wealthy Redferns and their Auckland magazine empire. It was a starting point for many actors who went on to many productions in New Zealand, Australia and around the world including Temuera Morrison, Miranda Harcourt, Peter Elliott, Lisa Chappell, Danielle Cormack and Kevin Smith. Many of them would go on to star in \"Shortland Street\", which has been New Zealand's most popular soap since its debut in 1992. It airs on TVNZ 2.\n\nRadio New Zealand began airing its first radio soap \"You Me Now\" in September 2010. It is available for podcast on its website.\n\nRelatively few daily soap operas have been produced on English Canadian television, with most Canadian stations and networks that carry soap operas airing those imported from the United States or the United Kingdom. Notable daily soaps that did exist included \"Family Passions\", \"Scarlett Hill\", \"Strange Paradise\", \"Metropia\", \"Train 48\" and the international co-production \"Foreign Affairs\". \"Family Passions\" was an hour-long program, as is typical of American daytime soaps; all of the others ran half-hour episodes. Unlike American or British soap operas, the most influential of which have run for years or even decades, even daily Canadian soap operas have run for a few seasons at most. Short-run soaps, including \"49th & Main\" and \"North/South\", have also aired. Many of these were produced in an effort to comply with Canadian content regulations, which require a percentage of programming on Canadian television to originate from Canada.\n\nNotable prime time soap operas in Canada have included \"Riverdale\", \"House of Pride\", \"Paradise Falls\", \"Lance et Compte\" (\"He Shoots, He Scores\"), \"Loving Friends and Perfect Couples\" and \"The City\". The \"Degrassi\" franchise of youth dramas also incorporated some elements of the soap opera format.\n\nOn French-language television in Quebec, the \"téléroman\" has been a popular mainstay of network programming since the 1950s. Notable téléromans have included \"Rue des Pignons\", \"Les Belles Histoires des pays d'en haut\", \"Diva\", \"La famille Plouffe\", and the soap opera parody \"Le Cœur a ses raisons\".\n\nUnlike the season based production in most countries, most of Indian television fiction tends to be regular-broadcasting soap opera. These started in the 1980s, as more and more people began to purchase television sets. At the beginning of the 21st century, soap operas became an integral part of Indian culture. Indian soap operas mostly concentrate on the conflict between love and arranged marriages occurring in India, and many includes family melodrama. Indian soap operas have multilingual production.\n\nMany soap operas produced in India are also broadcast overseas in the UK, Canada, the United States, and some parts of Europe, South Africa, Australia and South East Asia. They are often mass-produced under large production banners, with companies like Balaji Telefilms running different language versions of the same serial on different television networks or channels.\n\nThe Australian serial \"The Restless Years\" was remade in the Netherlands as \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" (which debuted in 1990) and in Germany as \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" (which has aired since 1992): both titles translate to \"good times, bad times\". These remakes are still airing, but have long since diverged from the original Australian storylines. The two shows are the highest-rated soap operas in their respective countries.\n\nA later Australian serial, \"Sons and Daughters\", has inspired five remakes produced under license from the original producers and based, initially, on original story and character outlines. These are \"Verbotene Liebe\" (Germany, 1995–2015); \"Skilda världar\" (Sweden, 1996–2002); \"Apagorevmeni agapi\" (Greece, 1998); \"Cuori Rubati\" (Italy, 2002–2003) and \"Zabranjena ljubav\" (Croatia, 2004–2008). Both \"The Restless Years\" and \"Sons and Daughters\" were created and produced in Australia by the Reg Grundy Organisation.\n\nThe Norwegian soap opera \"Hotel Cæsar\" aired on TV 2 from 1998 to 2017, and is the longest-running television drama in Scandinavia. Popular foreign soaps in the country include \"Days of Our Lives\" (broadcast on TV6 (Norway), \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" (TNT (Norway) and \"Home and Away\" (TV 2), all of which are subtitled.\n\nSerials have included \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" (1990–present), \"Onderweg naar Morgen\" (1994–2010) and \"Goudkust\" (1996–2001). In 2016 \"Goede tijden, slechte tijden\" spin-off \"Nieuwe Tijden\" started airing. U.S. daytime serials \"As The World Turns\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" have aired in the Netherlands; \"As the World Turns\" began airing in the country in 1990, with Dutch subtitles.\n\nIn the 1980s, West German networks successfully added American daytime and primetime soap operas to their schedule before Das Erste introduced its first self-produced weekly soap with \"Lindenstraße\", which was seen as a German counterpart to \"Coronation Street\". Like in other countries, the soap opera met with negative reviews, but eventually proved critics wrong with nearly 13 million viewers tuning in each week. Even though the format proved successful, it was not until 1992 before \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" became the first German daily soap opera. Early ratings were bad as were the reviews, but the RTL network was willing to give its first soap opera a chance; ratings would improve, climbing to 7 million viewers by 2002. Not long after \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\", Das Erste introduced \"Marienhof\", which aired twice a week.\n\nAfter successfully creating the first German daily soap, production company Grundy Ufa wanted to produce another soap for RTL. Like \"GZSZ\", the format was based on an Australian soap opera from Reg Watson. But RTL did not like the plot idea about separated twins who meet each other for the first time after 20 years and fall in love without knowing that they are related. The project was then taken to Das Erste, which commissioned the program, titled \"Verbotene Liebe\", which premiered on January 2, 1995. With the premiere of \"Verbotene Liebe\", the network turned \"Marienhof\" into a daily soap as well. In the meanwhile, RTL debuted the Grundy Ufa-produced \"Unter uns\" in late 1994.\n\nZDF started a business venture with Canada and co-produced the short-lived series \"Family Passions\", starring actors such as Gordon Thomson, Roscoe Born, Dietmar Schönherr and a young Hayden Christensen. The daytime serial premiered on December 5, 1994, lasting 130 episodes. After its cancellation, the network debuted \"Jede Menge Leben\". Even after a crossover with three soaps, \"Freunde fürs Leben\", \"Forsthaus Falkenau\" and \"Unser Lehrer Doktor Specht\", the soap was canceled after 313 episodes. Sat.1 tried to get into the soap business as well, after successfully airing the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\", which was dropped in 1995 due to the talk show phenomenon that took over most of the daytime schedules of German networks. The network first tried to tell a family saga with \"So ist das Leben! Die Wagenfelds\", before failing with \"Geliebte Schwestern\". RTL II made its own short-lived attempt with \"Alle zusammen – jeder für sich\".\n\nThe teen soap opera \"Schloss Einstein\" debuted on September 4, 1998, focusing on the life of a group of teenagers at the fictional titular boarding school near Berlin. As of July 2014, the series has produced over 815 episodes during the course of 17 seasons, a milestone in German television programming, and was renewed for an 18th season to debut in 2015.\n\nIn 1999, after the lasting success of \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\", \"Marienhof\", \"Unter uns\" and \"Verbotene Liebe\", ProSieben aired \"Mallorca – Suche nach dem Paradies\", set on the Spanish island with the same name. After nine months, the network canceled the program due to low viewership and high production costs. Even though ratings had improved, the show ended its run in a morning timeslot. The soap opera became something of a cult classic, as its 200-episode run was repeated several times on free-to-air and pay television.\n\nIn 2006, \"Alles was zählt\" became the last successful daily soap to make its debut, airing as a lead-in to \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\" and also produced by Grundy Ufa. Since Germany started to produce its own telenovelas, all soap operas faced declines in ratings. \"Unter uns\" was in danger of cancellation in 2009, but escaped such a fate due to budget cuts imposed by the show's producers and the firing of original cast member Holger Franke, whose firing and the death of his character outraged fans, resulting in a ratings spike in early 2010. After \"Unter uns\" was saved, Das Erste planned to make changes to its soap lineup. \"Marienhof\" had to deal with multiple issues in its storytelling, as well as in producing a successful half-hour show. Several changes were made within months, however \"Marienhof\" was canceled in June 2011. \"Verbotene Liebe\" was in danger of being cancelled as well, but convinced the network to renew it with changes that it made in both 2010 and 2011; the soap was later expanded to 45 minutes after \"Marienhof\" was canceled, and the network tried to decide on whether to revamp its lineup.\n\nWhile \"Gute Zeiten, schlechte Zeiten\", \"Unter uns\" and \"Alles was zählt\" are currently the only daily soaps on the air after \"Verbotene Liebe\" has been cancelled and aired its last episode in June, 2015 due to low ratings, the telenovelas \"Sturm der Liebe\" and \"Rote Rosen\" are considered soaps by the press as well, thanks to the changing protagonists every season.\n\nIn Belgium, the two major soap operas are \"Thuis\" (\"Home\") and \"Familie\" (\"Family\"). Soap operas have been very popular in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium. \"Familie\" debuted in late 1991, and with nearly 6,000 half-hour episodes, it has the highest episode total of any soap in Europe outside of the United Kingdom. The highest-rated soap opera is \"Thuis\", which has aired on \"één\" since late 1995. \"Thuis\" is often one of the five most-watched Belgian shows and regularly garners over one million viewers (with 6.3 million Flemmings in total).\n\nDuring the 1990s, foreign soap operas such as \"Neighbours\" and \"The Bold and the Beautiful\" were extremely popular, the latter having achieved a cult status in Belgium and airing in the middle of the decade during prime time. Both soaps still air today, along with other foreign soaps such as \"Days of Our Lives\", Australia's \"Home and Away\" and Germany's \"Sturm der Liebe\". Vitaya unsuccessful attempted to air the Dutch soap opera \"Goede Tijden, Slechte Tijden\" in 2010. Other foreign soaps that previously aired on Belgian television include \"The Young and the Restless\", \"EastEnders\" (both on VTM), \"Port Charles\" (at één, then known as TV1) and \"Coronation Street\" (on Vitaya). \"Santa Barbara\" aired during the 1990s on VTM for its entire run.\n\nThe only teen soap opera on Belgian television was \"Spring\" (\"Jump\" in English), which aired on the youth-oriented Ketnet and produced over 600 15-minute episodes from late 2002 until 2009, when it was cancelled after a steady decline in ratings following the departures of many of its original characters.\n\nThe most successful soap opera in Italy is the evening series \"Un posto al sole\" (\"A Place Under the Sun\"), which had aired on Rai 3 since 1996 (whose format is based on the Australian soap opera \"Neighbours\"). Several other Italian soaps have been produced such as \"Ricominciare\" (\"Starting Over\"), \"Cuori rubati\" (\"Stolen Hearts\"), \"Vivere\" (\"Living\"), \"Sottocasa\" (\"Downstairs\"), \"Agrodolce\" (\"Bittersweet\") and \"Centovetrine\" (\"Hundred Shop Windows\").\n\nThe most popular Italian prime-time soap opera, \"Incantesimo\" (\"Enchantment\"), which ran from 1998 to 2008, became a daytime soap opera for the final two years of its run, airing five days a week on Rai 1. The same happened with \"Il paradiso delle signore\" (\"Woman’s Paradise\"), a period drama, which ran from 2015 to 2017 in prime-time, and became a daytime period soap opera from 2018.\n\nIn the early years of RTÉ, the network produced several dramas but had not come close to launching a long-running serial. RTÉ's first television soap was \"Tolka Row\", which was set in urban Dublin. For several years, both \"Tolka Row\" and \"The Riordans\" were produced by RTÉ; however, the urban soap was soon dropped in favor of the more popular rural soap opera \"The Riordans\", which premiered in 1965. Executives from Yorkshire Television visited during on-location shoots for \"The Riordans\" in the early 1970s and in 1972, debuted \"Emmerdale Farm\" (now \"Emmerdale\"), based on the successful format of the Irish soap opera. In the late 1970s, \"The Riordans\" was controversially dropped. The creator of that series would then go on to produce the second of his \"Agri-soap\" trilogy \"Bracken\", starring Gabriel Byrne, whose character had appeared in the last few seasons of \"The Riordans\". Bracken was soon replaced by the third \"Agri-soap\" \"Glenroe\", which ran until 2001. As RTÉ wanted a drama series for its Sunday night lineup rather than a soap opera, \"On Home Ground\" (2001–2002), \"The Clinic\" (2002–2009) and \"RAW\" (2010–2013) replaced the agri-soaps of the previous decades.\n\nIn 1989, RTÉ decided to produce its first Dublin-based soap opera since the 1960s. \"Fair City\", which is set in the fictional city of Carrickstown, initially aired one night a week during the 1989-90 season, and similar to its rural soaps, much of the footage was filmed on location – in a suburb of Dublin City. In 1992, RTÉ made a major investment into the series by copying the houses used in the on-location shoots for an on-site set in RTÉ's Headquarters in Dublin 4. By the early 1990s, it was airing two nights a week for 35 weeks a year. With competition from the UK soap operas, RTÉ expanded \"Fair City\" to three nights a week for most of the year and one night a week during the summer in 1996, later expanding to four nights a week and two nights during the summer. Until the early 2000s, the series produced four episodes a week, airing all 52 weeks of the year. \"Fair City\" airs Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8.00 p.m. GMT on RTÉ One; however, after rival network TV3 moved \"Coronation Street\" to Thursday night, the Wednesday night episode of \"Fair City\" began airing at 7:30 p.m. each week.\n\nTG4 produce the Irish language soap \"Ros na Rún\" (\"Headland of the Secrets\" or \"Headland of the Sweethearts\"); set in the fictional village of \"Ros Na Rún\", located outside Galway and near Spiddal, it centres on the domestic and professional lives of the town's residents. It is modeled on an average village in the West of Ireland, but with its own distinct personality – with a diverse population that share secrets, romances and friendships among other things. While the core community has remained the same, the look and feel of \"Ros Na Rún\" has changed and evolved over the years to incorporate the changing face of rural Ireland. It has an established a place not only in the hearts and minds of the Irish speaking public, but also the wider Irish audience. The program has dealt with many topics, including domestic violence, infidelity, theft, arson, abortion, homosexuality, adoption, murder, rape, drugs, teen pregnancy and paedophilia. It runs twice a week for 35 weeks of the year, currently airing Tuesday and Thursday nights. \"Ros na Rún\" is the single largest independent production commissioned in the history of Irish broadcasting. Prior to TG4's launch, it originally aired on RTÉ One in the early 1990s.\n\nAlthough Ireland has access to international soaps (such as \"Coronation Street\", \"Emmerdale\", \"EastEnders\", \"Home and Away\", \"Hollyoaks\" and \"Neighbours\"), \"Fair City\" continues to outperform them all, and is Ireland's most popular soap opera, with the show peaking at over 700,000 viewers.\n\nJanuary 2015 \"Red Rock\" has broadcast on TV3. Red Rock airs twice a week on Wednesday and Thursday nights. The series is base in a fishing village in Dublin. The soaps centres around the local Garda station but also includes stories from the village.\n\nRTÉ Radio produced its first radio soap, \"Kennedys of Castleross\", which ran from April 13, 1955 to 1975. In 1979 RTÉ long running TV soap The Riordans moved to Radio until December 24, 1985. In the mid-1980s, RTÉ debuted a new radio soap, \"Harbour Hotel\", which ran until the mid-1990s. The network later ran two short-lived radio soaps, \"Konvenience Korner\" and \"Riverrun\", which were followed in 2004 by \"Driftwood\". RTÉ does not run any radio soaps, however RTÉ Radio 1 continues to air radio dramas as part of its nighttime schedule.\n\n\nIn Greece, there have been several soap operas.\n\nAn early serial was \"Sti skia tou hrimatos\" (\"Money Shadows\"), which ran from 1990 to 1991. September 1991 saw the debut of \"Lampsi\" (\"the Shining\"), from creator Nicos Foskolos. The series would become Greece's longest-running soap opera. After the success of \"Lampsi\" came the short lived \"To galazio diamandi\" (\"Blue Diamond\") and \"Simphonia siopis\" (\"Omertà\"). \"Lampsi\" was canceled in June 2005 due to declining ratings. It was replaced by \"Erotas\" (\"Love\"), a soap that ran from 2005 to 2008. After that series ended, ANT1 abandoned the soap opera genre and focused on comedy series and weekly dramas.\n\nGreece's second longest-running soap is \"Kalimera Zoi\" (\"Goodmorning Life\"), which ran from September 1993 until its cancellation in June 2006 due to low ratings.\n\nMega Channel began producing soap operas in 1990 with the prime time serial \"I Dipsa\" (\"The Thirst\"), which ran for 102 episodes. Other daytime soaps have included \"Paralliloi dromoi\" (1992–1994) and its successor \"Haravgi\" (\"Daylight\", 1994–1995), both of which were cancelled due to low viewership; as well as the serials \"Apagorevmeni Agapi\" (\"Forbidden Love\"), which ran from 1998 to 2006; \"Gia mia thesi ston Ilio\" (\"A Spot Under the Sun\"), which ran from 1998 to 2002; \"Filodoxies\" (\"Expectations\"), which ran from 2002 to 2006; and \"Vera Sto Deksi\" (\"Ring on the Right Hand\"), which ran from 2004 to 2006 and proved to be a successful competitor to \"Lampsi\", causing that show's ratings to decline.\n\n\"Ta Mistika Tis Edem\" (\"Edem Secrets\"), which was created by the producers of \"Vera Sto Deksi\", debuted in 2008 and has eclipsed that show's success. Its ratings place it consistently among the three highest-rated daytime programs.\n\nIENED (which was renamed ERT2 in 1982) was responsible for the first Greek soap operas \"I Kravgi Ton Likon\" and \"Megistanes\". ERT also produced the long-running soap \"O Simvoleografos\". Since 2000 and with the introduction of private television, ERT produced additional daily soap operas, which included \"Pathos\" (\"Passion\"), \"Erotika tis Edem\" (\"Loving in Eden\") and \"Ta ftera tou erota\" (\"The Wings of Love\"). These failed to achieve high ratings and were canceled shortly after their premiere.\n\nAlpha produced \"Kato apo tin Acropoli\" (\"Under the Acropolis\"), which ran for 2½ years.\n\nThe first daytime soap opera produced by a Cyprus channel was LOGOs TV's \"Odos Den Ksehno\" (\"'Don't Forget' Street\"), which ran from January to December 1996. It was followed by \"To Serial\", which also ran for one year from September 1997 to June 1998. CyBC created the third weekdaily soap, \"Anemi Tou Pathous\" (\"Passion Winds\"), running from January 2000 to June 2004, which was replaced by \"I Platia\" (\"The Square\") from September 2004 to July 2006. \"Epikindini Zoni\" ran from 2009 to 2010, and was cancelled after 120 episodes. \"Vimata Stin Ammo\" made its debut in September 2010.\n\nSigma TV first commissioned the weekdaily comedic soap \"Sto Para Pente\", which aired from September 1998 to June 2004, and first held the distinction of being the longest weekday show in Cyprus television history, before it was surpassed by \"Se Fonto Kokkino\", which ran from September 2008 to July 2012. Other Sigma TV weekday shows include \"Akti Oniron\" (which ran from 1999 to 2001), \"Vourate Geitonoi\" (which ran from 2001 to 2005, and was the most successful weekdaily series, achieving ratings shares of up to 70% of all television households in the country), \"Oi Takkoi\" (which ran from 2002 to 2005), \"S' Agapo\" (which ran from 2001 to 2002), \"Vasiliki\" (which ran from 2005 to 2006), \"Vendetta\" (which ran from September 2005 to December 2006), \"30 kai Kati\" (which ran from 2006 to 2007) and \"Mila Mou\" (which ran from September 2007 to January 2009).\n\nANT1 Cyprus aired the soap \"I Goitia Tis Amartias\" in 2002, which was soon canceled. \"Dikse Mou To Filo Sou\" followed from 2006 to 2009, along with \"Gia Tin Agapi Sou\", which ran from 2008 to 2009 and itself was followed by \"Panselinos\", which has aired since 2009.\n\nThe longest-running weekly show on Cyprus television is \"Istories Tou Horkou\" (\"Villages Stories\", which premiered on CyBC in March 1996 and ran until its cancellation in June 2006; it was revived in September 2010 but was cancelled again in March 2011 due to very low ratings), followed by \"Manolis Ke Katina\" (\"Manolis and Katina\", which ran from 1995 to 2004). The most controversial of these series was \"To Kafenio\" (\"The Coffee Shop\"), which premiered on CyBC on 1993 as a weekly series, before moving to MEGA Channel Cyprus six years later in 1999 as a weekdaily show and then moved to ANT1 Cyprus on 2000, which canceled the show one year later. There were plans to move the show back to CyBC as a weekly series in 2001, with the original cast, however this plan was never realised. The most successful weekly shows in Cyprus currently are ANT1's \"Eleni I Porni\" (\"Eleni, The Whore\"), which premiered in October 2010 and CyBC's \"Stin Akri Tu Paradisou\" (\"At The Heaven's Edge\"), which premiered in 2007. The most successful weekdaily soap was \"Aigia Fuxia\", which aired on ANT1 Cyprus from 2008 to 2010.\n\nThe only daily Finnish soap opera so far is \"Salatut elämät\" (\"Secret Lives\"), which has achieved popularity in Finland since its 1999 debut on MTV3. It focuses on the lives of people along the imaginary Pihlajakatu street in Helsinki. The show has also spawned several Internet spin-off series and a film based on the show that was released in 2012.\n\nOther soap-like shows in Finland are YLE shows \"Uusi päivä\" (which has aired since 2009) and \"Kotikatu\" (which ran from 1995 to 2012), however these programs do not adhere to a five-episode-a-week schedule.\n\nWith the advent of internet television and mobile phones, several soap operas have also been produced specifically for these platforms, including \"\", a spin-off of the established \"EastEnders\". For those produced only for the mobile phone, episodes may generally consist of about six or seven pictures and accompanying text.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, TG4 launched a new 10-part online series titled, \"Na Rúin\" (an Internet spin-off of \"Ros na Rún\"). The miniseries took on the theme of a mystery; the viewer had to read Rachel and Lorcán's blogs as well as watch video diaries detailing each character's thoughts to solve the mystery of missing teenage character Ciara.\n\nIn motion pictures, the 1982 comedy \"Tootsie\" has the lead character impersonating a woman in order to gain acting work on a long running television soap opera. Several scenes parody the production of soaps, their outrageous storylines and idiosyncratic stylistic elements.\n\nThe 1991 comedy \"Soapdish\" stars Sally Field as an aging soap opera actress on fictional series \"The Sun Also Sets\" who pines over her own neuroses and misfortunes such as her live-in boyfriend who leaves her to go back to his wife, and the incidents of backstabbing and scheming behind the scenes, some of which are more interesting than the stories on the program.\n\nAnother 1991 comedy, Delirious, stars John Candy as a soap opera writer who, after a head injury, has a dream experience of being in his own creation. The dream experience is an increasingly outrageous exaggeration of soap opera plot elements.\n\nOn television, several soap opera parodies have been produced:\n\n"}
{"id": "19508643", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19508643", "title": "Television show", "text": "Television show\n\nA television show (often simply TV show) is any content produced for broadcast via over-the-air, satellite, cable, or internet and typically viewed on a television set, excluding breaking news, advertisements, or trailers that are typically placed between shows. Television shows are most often scheduled well ahead of time and appear on electronic guides or other TV listings.\n\nA television show might also be called a television program (), especially if it lacks a narrative structure. A television series is usually released in episodes that follow a narrative, and are usually divided into \"seasons\" (US and Canada) or \"series\" (UK) – yearly or semiannual sets of new episodes. A show with a limited number of episodes may be called a miniseries, serial, or limited series. A one-time show may be called a \"special\". A television film (\"made-for-TV movie\" or \"television movie\") is a film that is initially broadcast on television rather than released in theaters or direct-to-video.\n\nTelevision shows can be viewed as they are broadcast in real time (live), be recorded on home video or a digital video recorder for later viewing, or be viewed on demand via a set-top box or streamed over the internet.\n\nThe first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s. Televised events such as the 1936 Summer Olympics in Germany, the 1937 coronation of King George VI in the UK, and David Sarnoff's famous introduction at the 1939 New York World's Fair in the US spurred a growth in the medium, but World War II put a halt to development until after the war. The 1947 World Series inspired many Americans to buy their first television set and then in 1948, the popular radio show \"Texaco Star Theater\" made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show, earning host Milton Berle the name \"Mr Television\" and demonstrating that the medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment which could attract advertisers. The first national live television broadcast in the US took place on September 4, 1951 when President Harry Truman's speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over AT&T's transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets.\n\nThe first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) in the US occurred on January 1, 1954. During the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. A color transition was announced for the fall of 1965, during which over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color. The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network shows converted to color, resulting in the first completely all-color network season.\n\nTelevision shows are more varied than most other forms of media due to the wide variety of formats and genres that can be presented. A show may be fictional (as in comedies and dramas), or non-fictional (as in documentary, news, and reality television). It may be topical (as in the case of a local newscast and some made-for-television films), or historical (as in the case of many documentaries and fictional series). They could be primarily instructional or educational, or entertaining as is the case in situation comedy and game shows.\n\nA drama program usually features a set of actors playing characters in a historical or contemporary setting. The program follows their lives and adventures. Before the 1980s, shows (except for soap opera-type serials) typically remained static without story arcs, and the main characters and premise changed little. If some change happened to the characters' lives during the episode, it was usually undone by the end. Because of this, the episodes could be broadcast in any order. Since the 1980s, many series feature progressive change in the plot, the characters, or both. For instance, \"Hill Street Blues\" and \"St. Elsewhere\" were two of the first American prime time drama television series to have this kind of dramatic structure, while the later series \"Babylon 5\" further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended five-season run.\n\nIn 2012, it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies' revenues than film. Some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs. In 2012, Academy-Award-winning film director Steven Soderbergh, commenting on ambiguity and complexity of character and narrative, stated: \"I think those qualities are now being seen on television and that people who want to see stories that have those kinds of qualities are watching television.\"\n\nWhen a person or company decides to create a new series, they develop the show's elements, consisting of the concept, the characters, the crew, and cast. Then they often \"pitch\" it to the various networks in an attempt to find one interested enough to order a prototype first episode of the series, known as a \"pilot.\" Eric Coleman, an animation executive at Disney, told an interviewer, \"One misconception is that it's very difficult to get in and pitch your show, when the truth is that development executives at networks want very much to hear ideas. They want very much to get the word out on what types of shows they're looking for.\"\n\nTo create the pilot, the structure and team of the whole series must be put together. If audiences respond well to the pilot, the network will pick up the show to air it the next season (usually Fall). Sometimes they save it for mid-season, or request rewrites and additional review (known in the industry as \"development hell\"). Other times, they \"pass\" entirely, forcing the show's creator to \"shop it around\" to other networks. Many shows never make it past the pilot stage.\n\nThe show hires a stable of writers, who usually work in parallel: the first writer works on the first episode, the second on the second episode, etc. When all the writers have been used, episode assignment starts again with the first writer. On other shows, however, the writers work as a team. Sometimes they develop story ideas individually, and pitch them to the show's creator, who folds them together into a script and rewrites them.\n\nIf the show is picked up, the network orders a \"run\" of episodes—usually only six or 13 episodes at first, though a season typically consists of at least 22 episodes. The midseason seven and last nine episodes are sometimes called the \"mid-seven\" and \"back nine\"—borrowing the colloquial terms from bowling and golf.\n\nThe method of \"team writing\" is employed on some longer dramatic series (usually running up to a maximum of around 13 episodes). The idea for such a program may be generated \"in-house\" by one of the networks; it could originate from an independent production company (sometimes a product of both). For example, the BBC's long-running soap opera \"EastEnders\" is wholly a BBC production, whereas its popular drama \"Life on Mars\" was developed by Kudos in association with the broadcaster.\n\nThere are still a significant number of programs (usually sitcoms), however, that are built by just one or two writers and a small, close-knit production team. These are \"pitched\" in the traditional way, but since the creators handle all the writing requirements, there is a run of six or seven episodes per series once approval has been given. Many of the most popular British comedies have been made this way, including \"Monty Python's Flying Circus\" (albeit with an exclusive team of six writer-performers), \"Fawlty Towers\", \"Blackadder\" and \"The Office\".\n\nThe production company is often separate from the broadcaster. The executive producer, often the show's creator, is in charge of running the show. They pick the crew and help cast the actors, approve and sometimes write series plots—some even write or direct major episodes—while various other producers help to ensure that the show runs smoothly. Very occasionally, the executive producer will cast themselves in the show. As with filmmaking or other electronic media production, producing of an individual episode can be divided into three parts: pre-production, principal photography, and post-production.\n\nPre-production begins when a script is approved. A director is chosen to plan the episode's final look.\n\nPre-production tasks include storyboarding; construction of sets, props, and costumes; casting guest stars; budgeting; acquiring resources like lighting, special effects, stunts, etc. Once the show is planned, it must then be scheduled: scenes are often filmed out of sequence, guest actors or even regulars may only be available at certain times. Sometimes the principal photography of different episodes must be done at the same time, complicating the schedule (a guest star might shoot scenes from two episodes on the same afternoon). Complex scenes are translated from storyboard to animatics to further clarify the action. Scripts are adjusted to meet altering requirements.\n\nSome shows have a small stable of directors, but also usually rely on outside directors. Given the time constraints of broadcasting, a single show might have two or three episodes in pre-production, one or two episodes in principal photography, and a few more in various stages of post-production. The task of directing is complex enough that a single director can usually not work on more than one episode or show at a time, hence the need for multiple directors.\n\nPrincipal photography is the actual filming of the episode. Director, actors and crew gather at a television studio or on location for filming or videoing a scene. A scene is further divided into shots, which should be planned during pre-production. Depending on scheduling, a scene may be shot in non-sequential order of the story. Conversations may be filmed twice from different camera angles, often using stand-ins, so one actor might perform all their lines in one set of shots, and then the other side of the conversation is filmed from the opposite perspective. To complete a production on time, a second unit may be filming a different scene on another set or location at the same time, using a different set of actors, an assistant director, and a second unit crew. A director of photography supervises the lighting of each shot to ensure consistency.\n\nLive events are usually covered by Outside Broadcast crews using mobile television studios, known as scanners or OB trucks. Although varying greatly depending on the era and subject covered, these trucks were normally crewed by up to 15 skilled operators and production personnel. In the UK for most of the 20th century, the BBC was the preeminent provider of outside broadcast coverage. BBC crews worked on almost every major event, including Royal weddings and funerals, major political and sporting events, and even drama programmes.\n\nOnce principal photography is complete, producers coordinate tasks to begin the video editing. Visual and digital video effects are added to the film; this is often outsourced to companies specializing in these areas. Often music is performed with the conductor using the film as a time reference (other musical elements may be previously recorded). An editor cuts the various pieces of film together, adds the musical score and effects, determines scene transitions, and assembles the completed show.\n\nMost television networks throughout the world are 'commercial', dependent on selling advertising time or acquiring sponsors. Broadcasting executives' main concern over their programming is on audience size. Once the number of 'free to air' stations was restricted by the availability of channel frequencies, but cable TV (outside the United States, satellite television) technology has allowed an expansion in the number of channels available to viewers (sometimes at premium rates) in a much more competitive environment.\n\nIn the United States, the average broadcast network drama costs $3million an episode to produce, while cable dramas cost $2million on average. The pilot episode may be more expensive than a regular episode. In 2004, \"Lost\"'s two-hour pilot cost $10 to$14million, in 2008 \"Fringe\"'s two-hour pilot cost $10million, and in 2010, \"Boardwalk Empire\" was $18million for the first episode. In 2011, \"Game of Thrones\" was $5 to $10million, \"Pan Am\" cost an estimated $10million, while \"Terra Nova\"'s two-hour pilot was between $10 to $20million.\n\nMany scripted network television shows in the United States are financed through deficit financing: a studio finances the production cost of a show and a network pays a license fee to the studio for the right to air the show. This license fee does not cover the show's production costs, leading to the deficit. Although the studio does not make its money back in the original airing of the show, it retains ownership of the show. This ownership retention allows the studio to make its money back and earn a profit through syndication and sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs. This system places most of the financial risk on the studios, however a show that is a hit in the syndication and home video markets can more than make up for the misses. Although the deficit financing system places minimal financial risk on the networks, they lose out on the future profits of big hits since they are only licensing the shows.\n\nCosts are recouped mainly by advertising revenues for broadcast networks and some cable channels, while other cable channels depend on subscription revenues. In general, advertisers, and consequently networks that depend on advertising revenues, are more interested in the number of viewers within the 18–49 age range than the total number of viewers. Advertisers are willing to pay more to advertise on shows successful with young adults because they watch less television and are harder to reach than older adults. According to \"Advertising Age\", during the 2007–08 season, \"Grey's Anatomy\" was able to charge $419,000 per commercial, compared to only $248,000 for a commercial during \"\", despite CSI having almost five million more viewers on average. Due to its strength in young demos, \"Friends\" was able to charge almost three times as much for a commercial as \"Murder, She Wrote\", even though the two series had similar total viewer numbers during the seasons they were on the air together. \"Glee\" and \"The Office\" drew fewer total viewers than \"NCIS\" during the 2009–10 season, but earned an average of $272,694 and $213,617 respectively, compared to $150,708 for NCIS.\n\nAfter production, the show is handed over to the television network, which sends it out to its affiliate stations, which broadcast it in the specified broadcast programming time slot. If the Nielsen ratings are good, the show is kept alive as long as possible. If not, the show is usually canceled. The show's creators are then left to shop around remaining episodes, and the possibility of future episodes, to other networks. On especially successful series, the producers sometimes call a halt to a series on their own like \"Seinfeld\", \"The Cosby Show\", \"Corner Gas\", and \"M*A*S*H\" and end it with a concluding episode, which sometimes is a big series finale.\n\nOn rare occasions, a series that has not attracted particularly high ratings and has been canceled can be given a reprieve if home video viewership has been particularly strong. This has happened in the cases of \"Family Guy\" in the US and \"Peep Show\" in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, if the show is popular or lucrative, and a minimum number of episodes (usually 100) have been made, it can go into broadcast syndication, where rights to broadcast the program are then resold for cash or put into a barter exchange (offered to an outlet for free in exchange for airing additional commercials elsewhere in the station's broadcast day).\n\nThe terminology used to define a set of episodes produced by a television series varies from country to country.\n\nIn North American television, a series is a connected set of television program episodes that run under the same title, possibly spanning many seasons. Since the late 1960s, this broadcast programming schedule typically includes between 20 and 26 episodes. Before then, a regular television season could average at least 30 episodes, and some TV series may have had as many as 39 episodes in a season.\n\nUntil the 1980s, most (but certainly not all) new programs for the American broadcast networks debuted in the \"fall season\", which ran from September through March and nominally contained from 24 to 26 episodes. These episodes were rebroadcast during the spring (or summer) season, from April through August. Because of cable television and the Nielsen sweeps, the \"fall\" season now normally extends to May. Thus, a \"full season\" on a broadcast network now usually runs from September through May for at least 22 episodes.\n\nA full season is sometimes split into two separate units with a hiatus around the end of the calendar year, such as the first season of \"Jericho\" on CBS. When this split occurs, the last half of the episodes sometimes are referred to with the letter B as in \"The last nine episodes (of \"The Sopranos\") will be part of what is being called either \"Season 6, Part 2\" or \"Season 6B\", or in \"\"Futurama\" is splitting its seasons similar to how \"South Park\" does, doing half a season at a time, so this is season 6B for them.\" Since the 1990s, these shorter seasons also have been referred to as \".5\" or half seasons, where the run of shows between September and December is labeled \"Season X\", and the second run between January and May labeled \"Season X.5\". Examples of this include the 2004 incarnation of \"Battlestar Galactica\", ABC's \"FlashForward\", and ABC Family's \"Make It or Break It\".\n\nSince at least the 2000s, new broadcast television series are often ordered (funded) for just the first 10 to 13 episodes, to gauge audience interest. If a series is popular, the network places a \"back nine order\" and the season is completed to the regular 20 to 26 episodes. An established series which is already popular, however, will typically receive an immediate full-season order at the outset of the season. A midseason replacement is a less-expensive short-run show of generally 10 to 13 episodes designed to take the place of an original series that failed to garner an audience and has not been picked up. A \"series finale\" is the last show of the series before the show is no longer produced. (In the UK, it means the end of a season, what is known in the United States as a \"\"season\" finale\").\n\nA standard television season in the United States runs predominantly across the fall and winter, from late September to May. During the summer months of June through roughly mid-September, network schedules typically feature reruns of their flagship programs, first-run series with lower ratings expectations, and other specials. First-run scripted series are typically shorter and of a lower profile than those aired during the main season and can also include limited series events. Reality and game shows have also been a fixture of the schedule.\n\nIn Canada, the commercial networks air most US programming in tandem with the US television season, but their original Canadian shows follow a model closer to British than American television production. Due to the smaller production budgets available in Canada, a Canadian show's season normally runs to a maximum of 13 episodes rather than 20 or more, although an exceptionally popular series such as \"Corner Gas\" or \"Murdoch Mysteries\" might receive 20-episode orders in later seasons. Canadian shows do not normally receive \"back nine\" extensions within the same season, however; even a popular series simply ends for the year when the original production order has finished airing, and an expanded order of more than 13 episodes is applied to the next season's renewal order rather than an extension of the current season. Only the public CBC Television normally schedules Canadian-produced programming throughout the year; the commercial networks typically now avoid scheduling Canadian productions to air in the fall, as such shows commonly get lost amid the publicity onslaught of the US fall season. Instead, Canadian-produced shows on the commercial networks typically air either in the winter as mid-season replacements for cancelled US shows or in the summer (which may also improve their chances of being picked up by a US network for a summer run).\n\nWhile network orders for 13- or 22-episode seasons are still pervasive in the television industry, several shows have deviated from this traditional trend. Written to be closed-ended and of shorter length than other shows, they are marketed with a variety of terms.\n\n\nIn India, the shows are particularly referred to as \"serials\", wherein the production is complex as well. The shows usually amount to at least 200 episodes, of 20 to25 minutes each. On special episodes, referred to as \"Maha-Episodes\", the duration last up to about 45 to 50 minutes. The show airs till the TRP (television rating point) is a little less than decent. The rating points depend on various criteria. Usually, shows which fail to attract TRP for a long time are shut down.\n\nIn the United Kingdom and other countries, these sets of episodes are referred to as a \"series\". In Australia, the broadcasting may be different from North American usage. The terms \"series\" and \"season\" are both used and are the same. For example, \"Battlestar Galactica\" has an original series as well as a remake, both are considered a different series each with their own number of individual seasons.\n\nAustralian television does not follow \"seasons\" in the way that US television does; for example, there is no \"fall season\" or \"fall schedule\". For many years, popular night-time dramas in Australia would run for much of the year, and would only go into recess during the summer period (December to February, as Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere), when ratings are not taken. Therefore, popular dramas would usually run from February through November each year. This schedule was used in the 1970s for popular dramas including \"Number 96\". Many drama series, such as \"McLeod's Daughters\", have received between 22 and 32 episodes per season. Typically, soap operas, which have always run in season format in Australia, such as \"Home and Away\", would usually begin a new season in late January, while the season finale would air in late November, as the show is off air for two months, or sometimes longer, depending on the schedule. In recent years, a new season would begin in early February, and the season finale would broadcast in early December. Since \"Home and Away\"s inception, it normally receives 230 episodes per season. Some seasons have seen between 205 and 235 episodes commissioned. During the Olympics, \"Home and Away\" would often go on hiatus, which was referred to as an \"Olympic cliffhanger\". Therefore, the number of episodes would decrease. Australian situation comedy series' seasons are approximately 13 episodes long and premiere any time between February and November.\n\nBritish shows have tended toward shorter series in recent years. For example, the first series of long-running science fiction show \"Doctor Who\" in 1963 featured forty-two 25‑minute episodes, this dropped to twenty-five by 1970 to accommodate changes in production and continued to 1984. For 1985 fewer but longer episodes were shown, but even after a return to shorter episodes in 1986, lack of support within the BBC meant fewer episodes were commissioned leading to only fourteen 25‑minute episodes up to those in 1989 after which it was cancelled. The revival of \"Doctor Who\" from 2005 has comprised thirteen 45‑minute installments. There are some series in the UK that have a larger number of episodes, for example \"Waterloo Road\" started with 8 to 12 episodes, but from series three onward it increased to twenty episodes and series seven will contain 30 episodes. Recently, American non-cable networks have also begun to experiment with shorter series for some programs, particularly reality shows, such as \"Survivor\". They often air two series per year, resulting in roughly the same number of episodes per year as a drama.\n\nThis is a reduction from the 1950s, in which many American shows (e.g. \"Gunsmoke\") had between 29 and 39 episodes per season. Actual storytelling time within a commercial television hour has also gradually reduced over the years, from 50 minutes out of every 60 to the current 44 (and even less on some networks), beginning in the early 21st century.\n\nThe usage of \"season\" and \"series\" differ for DVD and Blu-ray releases in both Australia and the UK. In Australia, many locally produced shows are termed differently on home video releases. For example, a set of the television drama series \"Packed to the Rafters\" or \"Wentworth\" is referred to as \"season\" (\"The Complete First Season\", etc.), whereas drama series such as \"Tangle\" are known as a \"series\" (\"Series 1\", etc.). British-produced shows such as \"Mrs. Brown's Boys\" are referred to as \"season\" in Australia for the DVD and Blu-ray releases.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, most programmes are referred to as 'series' while 'season' is starting to be used for some American and international releases.\n\nIn the United States, dramas produced for hour-long time slots typically are 39 to 42 minutes in length (excluding advertisements), while sitcoms produced for 30-minute time slots typically are 18 to 21 minutes long. There are exceptions as subscription-based TV channels (such as HBO, Starz, Cinemax, and Showtime) have episodes with 45 to 48 minutes of program, similar to Britain.\n\nIn Britain dramas typically run from 46 to 48 minutes on commercial channels, and 57 to 59 minutes on the BBC. Half-hour programmes are around 22 minutes on commercial channels, and around 28 minutes on the BBC. The longer duration on the BBC is due to the lack of advertising breaks.\n\nIn France most television shows (whether dramas, game shows or documentaries) have a duration of 52 minutes. This is the same on nearly all French networks (TF1, France 2, France 5, M6, Canal+, etc.).\n\n\n"}
{"id": "35061", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35061", "title": "60 Minutes", "text": "60 Minutes\n\n60 Minutes is an American news magazine and television program broadcast on the CBS television network. Debuting in 1968, the program was created by Don Hewitt, who chose to set it apart from other news programs by using a unique style of reporter-centered investigation. In 2002, \"60 Minutes\" was ranked at No. 6 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time and in 2013, it was ranked #24 on \"TV Guide\"s 60 Best Series of All Time. \"The New York Times\" has called it \"one of the most esteemed news magazines on American television\".\n\nThe program employed a magazine format, similar to that of the Canadian program \"W5\", which had premiered two years earlier. It pioneered many of the most important investigative journalism procedures and techniques, including re-editing interviews, hidden cameras, and \"gotcha journalism\" visits to the home or office of an investigative subject. Similar programs sprang up in Australia and Canada during the 1970s, as well as on local television news.\n\nInitially, \"60 Minutes\" aired as a bi-weekly show hosted by Harry Reasoner and Mike Wallace, debuting on September 24, 1968, and alternating weeks with other CBS News productions on Tuesday evenings at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The first edition, described by Reasoner in the opening as a \"kind of a magazine for television,\" featured the following segments:\n\nThe first \"magazine-cover\" chroma key was a photo of two helmeted policemen (for the Clark interview segment). Wallace and Reasoner sat in chairs on opposite sides of the set, which had a cream-colored backdrop; the more famous black backdrop (which is still used ) did not appear until the following year. The logo was in Helvetica type with the word \"Minutes\" spelled in all lower-case letters; the logo most associated with the show (rendered in Eurostile type with \"Minutes\" spelled in uppercase) did not appear until about 1974. Further, to extend the magazine motif, the producers added a \"Vol. xx, No. xx\" to the title display on the chroma key; modeled after the volume and issue number identifications featured in print magazines, this was used until about 1971. The trademark stopwatch, however, did not appear on the inaugural broadcast; it would not debut until several episodes later. Alpo dog food was the sole sponsor of the first program.\n\nDon Hewitt, who had been a producer of the \"CBS Evening News\" with Walter Cronkite, sought out Wallace as a stylistic contrast to Reasoner. According to one historian of the show, the idea of the format was to make the hosts the reporters, to always feature stories that were of national importance but focused upon individuals involved with, or in conflict with, those issues, and to limit the reports' airtime to around 13 minutes. However, the initial season was troubled by lack of network confidence, as the program did not garner ratings much higher than that of other CBS News documentaries. As a rule, during that era, news programming during prime time lost money; networks mainly scheduled public affairs programs in prime time in order to bolster the prestige of their news departments, and thus boost ratings for the regular evening newscasts, which were seen by far more people than documentaries and the like. \"60 Minutes\" struggled under that stigma during its first three years.\n\nChanges to \"60 Minutes\" came fairly early in the program's history. When Reasoner left CBS to co-anchor ABC's evening newscast (he would return to CBS and \"60 Minutes\" in 1978), Morley Safer joined the team in 1970, and he took over Reasoner's duties of reporting less aggressive stories. However, when Richard Nixon began targeting press access and reporting, even Safer, formerly the CBS News bureau chief in Saigon and London, began to do \"hard\" investigative reports, and during the 1970–1971 season alone \"60 Minutes\" reported on cluster bombs, the South Vietnamese Army, draft dodgers, Nigeria, the Middle East, and Northern Ireland.\n\nBy 1971, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) introduced the Prime Time Access Rule, which freed local network affiliates in the top 50 markets (in practice, the entire network) to take a half-hour of prime time from the networks on Mondays through Saturdays and one full hour on Sundays. Because nearly all affiliates found production costs for the FCC's intended goal of increased public affairs programming very high and the ratings (and by association, advertising revenues) low, making it mostly unprofitable, the FCC created an exception for network-authored news and public affairs shows. After a six-month hiatus in late 1971, CBS found a prime place for \"60 Minutes\" in a portion of that displaced time, 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern (5:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Central Time) on Sundays in January 1972.\n\nThis proved somewhat less than satisfactory, however, because in order to accommodate CBS' telecasts of late afternoon National Football League (NFL) football games, \"60 Minutes\" went on hiatus during the fall from 1972 to 1975 (and the summer of 1972). This took place because football telecasts were protected contractually from interruptions in the wake of the infamous \"Heidi Bowl\" incident on NBC in November 1968. Despite the irregular scheduling, the program's hard-hitting reports attracted a steadily growing audience, particularly during the waning days of the Vietnam War and the gripping events of the Watergate scandal; at that time, few if any other major network news shows did in-depth investigative reporting to the degree carried out by \"60 Minutes.\" Eventually, during the summers of 1973 through 1975, CBS did allow the program back onto the prime time schedule proper, on Fridays in 1973 and Sundays the two years thereafter, as a replacement for programs aired during the regular television season.\n\nIt was only when the FCC returned an hour to the networks on Sundays (for news or family programming), which had been taken away from them four years earlier, in a 1975 amendment to the Access Rule, that CBS finally found a viable permanent timeslot for \"60 Minutes.\" When a family-oriented drama, \"Three for the Road\", ended after a 12-week run in the fall, the newsmagazine took its place at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time (6:00 p.m. Central) on December 7, 1975. It has aired at that time since for 42 years , making \"60 Minutes\" not only the longest-running prime time program currently in production, but also the television program (excluding daily programs such as evening newscasts or morning news-talk shows) broadcasting for the longest length of time at a single time period each week in U.S. television history.\n\nThis move, and the addition of then-White House correspondent Dan Rather to the reporting team, made the program into a strong ratings hit and, eventually, a general cultural phenomenon. This was no less than a stunning reversal of the historically poor ratings performances of documentary programs on network television. By 1976, \"60 Minutes\" became the top-rated program on Sunday nights in the U.S. By 1979, it had achieved the #1 spot among all television programs in the Nielsen ratings, unheard of before for a news broadcast in prime time. This success translated into great profits for CBS, advertising rates went from $17,000 per 30-second spot in 1975 to $175,000 in 1982.\n\nThe program sometimes does not start until after 7:00 p.m. Eastern, due largely to CBS' live broadcast of NFL games. At the conclusion of an NFL game, \"60 Minutes\" will air in its entirety. However, on the West Coast (and all of the Mountain Time Zone), because the actual end of the live games is much earlier in the afternoon in comparison to the Eastern and Central time zones, \"60 Minutes\" is always able to start at its normal start time of 7:00 p.m. Pacific Time, leaving affiliates free to broadcast local news, the \"CBS Evening News\", and other local or syndicated programming leading up to \"60 Minutes\". The program's success has also led CBS Sports to schedule events (such as the final round of the Masters Tournament and the second round and regional final games of the NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament) leading into \"60 Minutes\" and the rest of the network's primetime lineup, thus (again, except on the West Coast) pre-empting the Sunday editions of the \"CBS Evening News\" and affiliates' local newscasts.\n\nStarting in the 2012–2013 season, in order to accompany a new NFL rule that the second game of an NFL doubleheader start at 4:25 p.m., CBS officially changed the start time of \"60 Minutes\" to 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on Sundays in Eastern and Central Time Zone markets when there is an NFL doubleheader scheduled to air (there are nine doubleheaders during the NFL season – eight during the first 16 weeks of the season, and the final week) to protect against overruns. The start time remains at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time in markets where only a single game is set to air (markets that have only a 1:00 p.m. Eastern time game on single game weeks, and in markets where a home team's NFL game is on Fox at 4:05 p.m., meaning CBS cannot air a doubleheader because of restrictions imposed by the NFL).\n\nThe program has rarely been pre-empted since 1978. Two notable pre-emptions occurred in 1976 and 1977, to make room for the annual telecast of \"The Wizard of Oz\", which had recently returned to CBS after having been shown on NBC for eight years. However, CBS would, in later years, schedule the film so that it would no longer pre-empt \"60 Minutes\". Another exception is on years when CBS airs the Super Bowl or since 2003, alternating, odd-numbered years where the AFC Championship Game has the 6:30 p.m. Eastern start time, which is played into prime-time and followed by a special lead-out program.\n\nOn September 22, 2013, CBS chose to pre-empt \"60 Minutes\" as a result of carrying the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards after an NFL doubleheader.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" is also simulcast on several former CBS Radio flagship stations now owned by Entercom (such as KYW in Philadelphia, WCBS in New York City, WBBM in Chicago, WWJ in Detroit and KCBS in San Francisco) when it airs locally on their sister CBS Television Network affiliate; even in the Central and Eastern time zones, the show is aired at the top of the hour at 7:00 p.m./6:00 p.m. Central (barring local sports play-by-play pre-emptions and breaking news coverage) no matter how long the show is delayed on CBS Television, resulting in radio listeners often hearing the show on those stations ahead of the television broadcast. An audio version of each broadcast without advertising began to be distributed via podcast and the iTunes Store, starting with the September 23, 2007 broadcast. Video from \"60 Minutes\" (including full episodes) is also made available for streaming several hours after the program's initial broadcast on CBSNews.com and CBS All Access.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" consists of three long-form news stories, without superimposed graphics. There is a commercial break between two stories. Each story is introduced from a set with a backdrop resembling pages from a magazine story on the same topic. The program undertakes its own investigations and follows up on investigations instigated by national newspapers and other sources. Unlike its most famous competitor \"20/20\" as well as traditional local and national news programs, the \"60 Minutes\" journalists \"never\" share the screen with (or speak to) other \"60 Minutes\" journalists on camera at \"any\" time. This creates a strong psychological sense of intimacy between the journalist and the television viewer.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" blends the probing journalism of the seminal 1950s CBS series \"See It Now\" with Edward R. Murrow (a show for which Hewitt served as the director for its first few years) and the personality profiles of another Murrow program, \"Person to Person\". In Hewitt's own words, \"60 Minutes\" blends \"higher Murrow\" and \"lower Murrow\".\n\nFor most of the 1970s, the program included \"Point/Counterpoint\", in which a liberal and a conservative commentator debated a particular issue. This segment originally featured James J. Kilpatrick representing the conservative side and Nicholas von Hoffman for the liberal, with Shana Alexander taking over for von Hoffman after he departed in 1974. The segment was an innovation that caught the public imagination as a live version of competing editorials. In 1979, Alexander asked Hewitt to raise the pay of $350 a week, Hewitt declined, and the segment ended.\n\n\"Point/Counterpoint\" was also lampooned by the NBC comedy series \"Saturday Night Live\", which featured Jane Curtin and Dan Aykroyd as debaters, with Aykroyd announcing the topic, Curtin making an opening statement, then Aykroyd typically retorting with, \"Jane, you ignorant slut\" and Curtin with \"Dan, you pompous ass\". In the 1980 film \"Airplane!\", in which the \"faux\" Kilpatrick argues in favor of the plane crashing stating \"they bought their tickets, they knew what they were getting into\"; and in the earlier sketch comedy film, \"The Kentucky Fried Movie\", where the segment was called \"Count/Pointercount\".\n\nA similar concept was revived briefly in March 2003, this time featuring Bob Dole and Bill Clinton, former opponents in the 1996 presidential election. The pair agreed to do ten segments, called \"Clinton/Dole\" and \"Dole/Clinton\" in alternating weeks, but did not continue into the 2003–2004 fall television season. Reports indicated that the segments were considered too gentlemanly, in the style of the earlier \"Point/Counterpoint\", and lacked the feistiness of \"Crossfire\".\n\nFrom 1978 to 2011, the program usually ended with a (usually light-hearted and humorous) commentary by Andy Rooney expounding on topics of wildly varying import, ranging from international politics, to economics, and to personal philosophy on everyday life. One recurring topic was measuring the amount of coffee in coffee cans.\n\nRooney's pieces, particularly one in which he referred to actor Mel Gibson as a \"wacko\", on occasion led to complaints from viewers. In 1990, Rooney was suspended without pay for three months by then-CBS News President David Burke, because of the negative publicity around his saying that \"too much alcohol, too much food, drugs, homosexual unions, cigarettes [are] all known to lead to premature death.\" He wrote an explanatory letter to a gay organization after being ordered not to do so. After only four weeks without Rooney, \"60 Minutes\" lost 20% of its audience. CBS management then decided that it was in the best interest of the network to have Rooney return immediately.\n\nRooney published several books documenting his contributions to the program, including \"Years Of Minutes\" and \"A Few Minutes With Andy Rooney\". Rooney retired from \"60 Minutes\", delivering his final commentary on October 2, 2011, it was his 1,097th commentary over his 34-year career on the program. He died one month later on November 4, 2011. The November 13, 2011 edition of \"60 Minutes\" featured an hour-long tribute to Rooney and his career, and included a rebroadcast of his final commentary segment.\n\nThe opening sequence features a \"60 Minutes\" \"magazine cover\" with the show's trademark, an Aristo stopwatch, intercut with preview clips of the episode's stories. The sequence ends with each of the current correspondents and hosts introducing themselves. The last host who appears (currently Scott Pelley) then says, \"Those stories tonight on \"60 Minutes\"\". When Rooney was a prominent fixture, the final line was \"Those stories and Andy Rooney, tonight on \"60 Minutes\"\". Before that, and whenever Rooney did not appear, the final line was \"Those stories and more, tonight on \"60 Minutes\"\".\n\n\"60 Minutes\" was the first, and remains the only, regularly scheduled program in the U.S. to never have used theme music. The only \"theme\" is the ticking of the stopwatch, which counts off each of the broadcast's titular 60 minutes, starting from zero at the beginning of each show. It is seen during the opening title sequence, before each commercial break, and at the tail-end of the closing credits, and each time it appears it displays (within reasonable accuracy) the elapsed time of the episode to that point.\n\nOn October 29, 2006, the opening sequence changed from a black background, which had been used for over a decade, to white. Also, the gray background for the Aristo stopwatch in the \"cover\" changed to red, the color for the title text changed to white, and the stopwatch itself changed from the diagonal position it had been oriented in for 31 years to an upright position.\n\nVideos and transcripts of \"60 Minutes\" editions, as well as clips that were not included in the broadcast are available on the program's website. In September 2010, the program launched a website called \"60 Minutes Overtime\", in which stories broadcast on-air are discussed in further detail.\n\nCBS Interactive released a mobile app in 2013, \"60 Minutes for iPad\", which allows users to watch \"60 Minutes\" on iPad devices and access some of the show's archival footage.\n\n\n\n\n\nCommentators for \"60 Minutes\" have included:\n\nBased on ratings, \"60 Minutes\" is the most successful program in U.S. television history since it was moved into its present timeslot in 1975. For five of its seasons it has been that year's top program, a feat matched by the sitcoms \"All in the Family\" and \"The Cosby Show\", and surpassed only by the reality competition series \"American Idol\", which had been the #1 show for eight consecutive seasons from the 2003–2004 television season up to the 2010–2011 season. \"60 Minutes\" was a top ten show for 23 seasons in a row (1977–2000), an unsurpassed record, and has made the Top 20 for every season since the 1976–1977 season, except the 2005–2006 season when it finished at #21.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" first broke into the Nielsen Top 20 during the 1976–1977 season. The following season, it was the fourth-most-watched program, and by 1979–1980, it was the number one show. During the 21st century, it remains among the top 20 programs in the Nielsen ratings, and the highest-rated news magazine.\n\nThe November 16, 2008 edition featuring an interview with President-elect Barack Obama, earned a total viewership of 25.1 million viewers.\n\nThe October 6, 2013 edition (which was delayed by 44 minutes that evening due to a Denver Broncos-Dallas Cowboys NFL game) drew 17.94 million viewers; retaining 63% of the 28.32 million viewers of its lead-in, and making it the most watched \"60 Minutes\" broadcast since December 16, 2012.\n\nThe December 1, 2013 edition (delayed 50 minutes due to a Broncos-Kansas City Chiefs game) was watched by 18.09 million viewers, retaining 66% of its NFL lead-in (which earned 28.11 million viewers during the 7:00 p.m. hour).\n\nThe March 25, 2018 edition featuring Stormy Daniels giving details on her alleged affair with President Donald Trump drew 22.1 million viewers, the most since the aforementioned Obama interview in 2008. The broadcast was delayed due to the NCAA men's basketball regional final on CBS between Kansas and Duke going to overtime.\n\n, \"60 Minutes\" had won a total of 138 Emmy Awards, a record unsurpassed by any other primetime program on U.S. television.\n\nThe program has won 20 Peabody Awards for segments including \"All in the Family\", an investigation into abuses by government and military contractors; \"The CIA's Cocaine\", which uncovered CIA involvement in drug smuggling, \"Friendly Fire\", a report on incidents of friendly fire in the Gulf War; \"The Duke Rape Case\", an investigation into accusations of rape at an off campus lacrosse team party in 2006, and \"The Killings in Haditha\", an investigation into the killing of Iraqi civilians by U.S. Marines.\n\nThe show received an Investigative Reporter and Editor medal for their segment \"The Osprey\", documenting a Marine cover-up of deadly flaws in the V-22 Osprey aircraft.\n\nIn 1983, a report by Morley Safer, \"Lenell Geter's in Jail\", helped exonerate a Texas man who was wrongly convicted and imprisoned for armed robbery.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" currently holds the record for the longest continuously running program of any genre scheduled during American network prime time, it has aired at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays since December 7, 1975 (although since 2012, it is officially scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sundays where a CBS affiliate has a late NFL game).\n\nThe longer-running \"Meet the Press\" has also aired in prime time. Debuting in 1947, it has been a daytime program since 1965. The Walt Disney anthology television series, which premiered in 1954, and the \"Hallmark Hall of Fame\", which has aired since 1951, have aired longer than \"60 Minutes\", but none of them has aired in prime time continually, as \"60 Minutes\" has done.\n\nThe show has been praised for landmark journalism and received many awards. However, it has also become embroiled in some controversy, including (in order of appearance):\n\nOn November 23, 1986, \"60 Minutes\" aired a segment greenlit by Hewitt, concerning the Audi 5000 automobile, a popular German luxury car. The story covered a supposed problem of \"unintended acceleration\" when the brake pedal was pushed, with emotional interviews with six people who sued Audi (unsuccessfully) after they crashed their cars, including one woman whose 6-year-old boy had been killed. In the \"60 Minutes\" segment footage was shown of an Audi 5000 with the accelerator \"moving down on its own\", accelerating the car. It later emerged that an expert witness employed by one of the plaintiffs modified the accelerator with a concealed device, causing the \"unintended acceleration\". Independent investigators concluded that this \"unintended acceleration\" was most likely due to driver error, where the driver let their foot slip off the brake and onto the accelerator. Tests by Audi and independent journalists showed that even with the throttle wide open, the car would simply stall if the brakes were actually being used.\n\nThe incident devastated Audi sales in the United States, which did not rebound for 15 years. The initial incidents which prompted the report were found by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada to have been attributable to operator error, where car owners had depressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake pedal. CBS issued a partial retraction, without acknowledging the test results of involved government agencies. Years later, \"Dateline NBC\", a rival to \"60 Minutes\", was found guilty of similar tactics regarding the fuel tank integrity of General Motors pickup trucks.\n\nIn February 1989, \"60 Minutes\" aired a report by the Natural Resources Defense Council claiming that the use of daminozide (Alar) on apples presented an unacceptably high health risk to consumers. Apple sales dropped and CBS was sued unsuccessfully by apple growers. Alar was subsequently banned for use on food crops in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nOn March 3, 1991, \"60 Minutes\" broadcast \"Werner Erhard,\" which dealt with controversies involving Erhard's personal and business life. One year after the \"60 Minutes\" piece aired, Erhard filed a lawsuit against CBS, claiming that the broadcast contained several \"false, misleading and defamatory\" statements about him. One month after filing the lawsuit, Erhard filed for dismissal. Erhard later told Larry King in an interview that he dropped the suit after receiving legal advice telling him that in order to win it, he had to prove not only that CBS knew the allegations were false but also that CBS acted with malice. After numerous independent journalists exposed untruths and factual inaccuracies in the story the segment was removed by CBS from its archives, with a disclaimer: \"This segment has been deleted at the request of CBS News for legal or copyright reasons.\"\n\nIn 1995, former Brown & Williamson Vice President for Research and Development Jeffrey Wigand provided information to \"60 Minutes\" producer Lowell Bergman that B&W had systematically hidden the health risks of their cigarettes (see transcription). Furthermore, it was alleged that B&W had introduced foreign agents (such as fiberglass and ammonia) with the intent of enhancing the effect of nicotine. Bergman began to produce a piece based upon the information, but ran into opposition from Don Hewitt who, along with CBS lawyers, feared a billion dollar lawsuit from Brown and Williamson for tortious interference for encouraging Wigand to violate his non-disclosure agreement. A number of people at CBS would benefit from a sale of CBS to Westinghouse Electric Corporation, including the head of CBS lawyers and CBS News. Also, because of the interview, the son of CBS President Laurence Tisch (who also controlled Lorillard Tobacco) was among the people from the big tobacco companies at risk of being caught having committed perjury. Due to Hewitt's hesitation, \"The Wall Street Journal\" instead broke Wigand's story. The \"60 Minutes\" piece was eventually aired with substantially altered content and minus some of the most damning evidence against B&W. The exposé of the incident was published in an article in \"Vanity Fair\" by Marie Brenner, entitled \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\".\n\n\"The New York Times\" wrote that \"the traditions of Edward R. Murrow and \"60 Minutes\" itself were diluted in the process,\" though the newspaper revised the quote slightly, suggesting that \"60 Minutes\" and CBS had \"betrayed the legacy of Edward R. Murrow\". The incident was turned into a seven-times Oscar-nominated feature film entitled \"The Insider\", directed by Michael Mann and starring Russell Crowe as Wigand, Al Pacino as Bergman, and Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace. Wallace denounced the portrayal of him as inaccurate to his stance on the issue.\n\n\"60 Minutes\" alleged in 1997 that agents of the U.S. Customs Service ignored drug trafficking across the Mexico–United States border at San Diego. The only evidence was a memorandum apparently written by Rudy Camacho, who was the head of the San Diego branch office. Based on this memo, CBS alleged that Camacho had allowed trucks belonging to a particular firm to cross the border unimpeded. Mike Horner, a former Customs Service employee, had passed the memos on to \"60 Minutes\", and even provided a copy with an official stamp. Camacho was not consulted about the piece, and his career was devastated in the immediate term as his own department placed suspicion on him. In the end, it turned out that Horner had forged the documents as an act of revenge for his treatment within the Customs Service. Camacho sued CBS and settled for an undisclosed amount of money in damages. Hewitt was forced to issue an on-air retraction.\n\nA legal battle between archaeologists and the Umatilla tribe over the remains of a skeleton, nicknamed Kennewick Man, was reported by \"60 Minutes\" on October 25, 1998, to which the Umatilla tribe reacted negatively. The tribe considered the segment heavily biased in favor of the scientists, cutting out important arguments, such as explanations of Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. The report focused heavily on the racial politics of the controversy and also added inflammatory arguments, such as questioning the legitimacy of Native American sovereignty – much of the racial focus of the segment was later reported to have been either unfounded and/or misinterpreted.\n\nOn March 12, 2000, \"60 Minutes\" aired an interview with Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. At the time, McVeigh had already been convicted and sentenced to death for the April 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building and subsequent deaths of 168 people. On the program, McVeigh was given the opportunity to vent against the government. Following the program, a federal policy called the Special Confinement Unit Media Policy was enacted prohibiting face-to-face interviews with death row inmates. A federal inmate challenged the policy in \"Hammer v. Ashcroft\", under which the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit upheld the prison policy. In March 2010, the United States Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in the case, and the policy limiting media access to death row inmates remains in place. CBS refuses to show the entire interview, and has stated no reasons.\n\nIn recent years, the program has been accused of promoting books, films, and interviews with celebrities who are published or promoted by sister businesses of media conglomerate Viacom (which owned CBS from 2000 to 2005, and is now owned by National Amusements, which is also the parent of CBS) and publisher Simon & Schuster (which remains a part of CBS Corporation after the 2005 CBS/Viacom split), without disclosing the journalistic conflict-of-interest to viewers.\n\nThe Killian documents controversy involved six documents critical of President George W. Bush's service in the Texas Air National Guard in 1972–1973. Four of these documents were presented as authentic in a \"60 Minutes Wednesday\" broadcast aired by CBS on September 8, 2004, less than two months before the 2004 Presidential Election, but it was later found that CBS had failed to authenticate the documents. Subsequently, several typewriter and typography experts concluded the documents are forgeries, as have some media sources. No forensic document examiners or typography experts authenticated the documents, which may not be possible without original documents. The provider of the documents, Lt. Col. Bill Burkett, claimed to have burned the originals after faxing copies to CBS. The whole incident was turned into a feature-length film entitled \"Truth\".\n\nA segment aired on the March 29, 2009, edition of \"60 Minutes\", \"The Internet Is Infected\", featured an interview with Don Jackson, a data protection professional for SecureWorks. Jackson himself declares in the program that: \"A part of my job is to know the enemy\". However, during the interview, Jackson showed a photo of Finnish upper-level comprehensive school pupils and misidentified them as Russian hackers. In the photo, one of the children is wearing a jacket with the Coat of Arms of Finland on it. Another one is wearing a cap which clearly has the logo of Karjala, a Finnish brand of beer, on it. The principal of the school in Taivalkoski confirmed that the photo was taken at the school about five years before the program was broadcast.\n\nThe photo's exact origins are unknown, but it is widely known in Finland, having been originally posted to a Finnish social networking site, IRC-Galleria, in the early 2000s. It spread all over Finnish internet communities, and even originated a couple of patriotically titled (but intentionally misspelled) mock sites. \"60 Minutes\" later issued a correction and on-air apology.\n\nSubsequent to the 2012 Benghazi attack, \"60 Minutes\" aired a report by correspondent Lara Logan on October 27, 2013, in which British military contractor, Dylan Davies, identified by CBS under the pseudonym \"Morgan Jones,\" described racing to the Benghazi compound several hours after the main assault was over, scaling a 12-foot wall and knocking out a lone fighter with the butt of a rifle. He also claimed to have visited a Benghazi hospital earlier that night where he saw Ambassador Christopher Stevens' body.\n\nIn the days following the report, Davies' personal actions were challenged. The FBI, which had interviewed Davies several times and considered him a credible source, said the account Davies had given them was different than what he told \"60 Minutes\". Davies stood by his story, but the inconsistency ultimately prompted \"60 Minutes\" to conclude it was a mistake to include Davies in their report and a correction was issued.\n\nFollowing the correction, a journalistic review was conducted by Al Ortiz, CBS News' executive director of standards and practices. He determined that red flags about Davies' account were missed. Davies had said to the program and written in his book that he told an alternative version of his actions to his employer, who he said had demanded that he stay inside his Benghazi villa as the attack unfolded. That alternative version was shared with US authorities and 60 Minutes was unable to prove the story Davies had told them was true.\n\nDavies' book, \"The Embassy House\", was published two days after the \"60 Minutes\" report, by Threshold Editions, part of the Simon and Schuster unit of CBS. It was pulled from shelves once \"60 Minutes\" issued its correction.\n\nOn November 26, 2013, Lara Logan was forced to take a leave of absence due to the errors in the Benghazi report.\n\nOn December 15, 2013, \"60 Minutes\" aired a report on the National Security Agency (NSA) that was widely criticized as false and a \"puff piece.\" The story was reported by John Miller, who once worked in the office of the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nOn March 30, 2014, \"60 Minutes\" presented a story on the Tesla Model S luxury electric automobile in a segment, with Scott Pelley conducting an interview with CEO Elon Musk concerning the car brand as well as his SpaceX company. Within a day, the automotive blog site Jalopnik reported that the sounds accompanying footage of the car shown during the story were actually sounds from a traditional gasoline engine dubbed over the footage, when in reality the electric car is much quieter. CBS released a statement explaining that the sound was the result of an audio editing error, and subsequently removed the noise from the online version of the piece. However, several news outlets, as well as Jalopnik itself, have expressed doubt over the authenticity of this explanation, noting the similar scandal involving Tesla Motors and \"The New York Times\" in 2013.\n\nAfter the resignation of CBS news head Les Moonves, an investigation into sexual harassment at CBS, including 60 Minutes, uncovered evidence of long-running sexual harassment issues stemming from behavior of 60 Minutes producers Jeff Fager and Don Hewitt.\n\nThe main \"60 Minutes\" show has created a number of spin-offs over the years.\n\n\"30 Minutes\" was a newsmagazine aimed at children that was patterned after \"60 Minutes\", airing as the final program in CBS's Saturday morning lineup from 1978 to 1982. It was hosted by Christopher Glenn (who also served as the voice-over for the interstitial program \"In the News\" and was an anchor on the CBS Radio Network), along with Betsy Aaron (1978–1980) and Betty Ann Bowser (1980–1982).\n\n\"60 Minutes More\" was a spin-off that ran for one season from 1996 to 1997. The episodes featured popular stories from the past that were expanded with updates on the original story. Each episode featured three of these segments.\n\nIn 1999, a second edition of \"60 Minutes\" was started in the U.S., called \"60 Minutes II\". This edition was later renamed \"60 Minutes\" by CBS for the fall of 2004 in an effort to sell it as a high-quality program, since some had sarcastically referred to it as \"60 Minutes, Jr.\" CBS News president Andrew Heyward said, \"The Roman numeral II created some confusion on the part of the viewers and suggested a watered-down version\". However, a widely known controversy which came to be known as \"Rathergate\", regarding a report that aired September 8, 2004, caused another name change. The program was retitled \"60 Minutes Wednesday\" both to differentiate itself and to avoid tarnishing the Sunday edition, as the editions were editorially independent from one another. It reverted to its original Roman numeral title on July 8, 2005, when the program moved to Fridays in an 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time slot to finish its run. The show's final broadcast was on September 2, 2005.\n\nIn 2011, CNBC began airing a \"60 Minutes\" spin-off of its own, called \"60 Minutes on CNBC\". Hosted by Lesley Stahl and Steve Kroft, it airs updated business-related reports seen on the original broadcasts and offers footage that was not included when the segments first aired.\n\nIn 2013, CBS's sister premium television network Showtime premiered \"60 Minutes Sports\", a monthly spin-off focused on sports-related stories and classic interviews from the show's archives. Personalities from CBS Sports also contributed to the program. The spin-off was considered to be a competitor to HBO's \"Real Sports\", and was cancelled in January 2017.\n\nFor the \"60 Minutes\" 25th anniversary in 1993, Charles Kuralt interviewed Don Hewitt, the active correspondents, some former correspondents, and revisited notable stories and celebrities.\n\nThe Australian version of \"60 Minutes\" premiered on February 11, 1979. It still airs each Sunday night at 7:30 p.m. on the Nine Network and affiliates. Although Nine Network has the rights to the format, , it does not have rights to stories from the U.S. program. Nevertheless, stories from the flagship \"60 Minutes\" program in the U.S. often air on the Australian program by subleasing them from Network Ten. In 1980, \"60 Minutes\" won a Logie Award for their investigation of lethal abuses at the Chelmsford psychiatric hospital in Sydney.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, an edited version (approx. 30 minutes in length) of the U.S. broadcast edition of \"60 Minutes\", entitled \"60 Minutes: CBS im Dritten\" (\"60 Minutes: CBS on Channel 3\") was shown for a time on West German television. This version retained the English-language soundtrack of the original, but also featured German subtitles.\n\nThe New Zealand version of \"60 Minutes\" has aired on national television since 1989, when it was originally launched on TV3. In 1992, the rights were acquired by TVNZ, who began broadcasting it in 1993. The network aired the program for nine years before dropping it in 2002 for its own program, entitled \"Sunday\", which is currently the highest-rated current affairs show broadcast on New Zealand television, followed by \"20/20\". \"60 Minutes\" was broadcast by rival network TV3, before switching to the Sky Television owned Prime channel in 2013, when the contract changed hands.\n\nThe original programs are shown in Portugal on SIC Notícias with introductory and closing remarks by journalist Mário Crespo.\n\nThe news program of National Broadcasting of Chile (TVN), the public television network in that country, was named \"60 Minutos\" (\"60 Minutes\") from 1975 to 1988, but the program had no association with the US version and no investigative reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "163246", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=163246", "title": "All in the Family", "text": "All in the Family\n\nAll in the Family is an American sitcom television series that was originally broadcast on the CBS television network for nine seasons, from January 12, 1971, to April 8, 1979. The following September, it was continued with the spin-off series\" Archie Bunker's Place\", which picked up where \"All in the Family\" had ended and ran for four more seasons through 1983.\n\n\"All in the Family\" was produced by Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin. It starred Carroll O'Connor, Jean Stapleton, Sally Struthers, and Rob Reiner. The show revolves around the life of a working-class father and his family. The show broke ground in its depiction of issues previously considered unsuitable for a U.S. network television comedy, such as racism, antisemitism, infidelity, homosexuality, women's liberation, rape, religion, miscarriages, abortion, breast cancer, the Vietnam War, menopause, and impotence. Through depicting these controversial issues, the series became arguably one of television's most influential comedic programs, as it injected the sitcom format with more dramatic moments and realistic, topical conflicts.\n\n\"All in the Family\" is often regarded in the United States as one of the greatest television series of all time. Following a lackluster first season, the show soon became the most watched show in the United States during summer reruns and afterwards ranked number one in the yearly Nielsen ratings from 1971 to 1976. It became the first television series to reach the milestone of having topped the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive years. The episode \"Sammy's Visit\" was ranked number 13 on \"TV Guide's\" 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time. \"TV Guide's \"50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time ranked \"All in the Family\" as number four. \"Bravo\" also named the show's protagonist, Archie Bunker, TV's greatest character of all time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked \"All in the Family\" the fourth-best written TV series ever.\n\n\"All in the Family\" is about a working-class white family living in Queens, New York. Its patriarch is Archie Bunker (O'Connor), an outspoken, narrow-minded man, seemingly prejudiced against everyone who is not like him or his idea of how people should be. Archie's wife Edith (Jean Stapleton) is sweet and understanding, though somewhat naïve and uneducated; her husband sometimes disparagingly calls her \"dingbat\". Their one child, Gloria (Sally Struthers), is generally kind and good-natured like her mother, but displays traces of her father's stubbornness and temper; unlike them, she's a feminist. Gloria is married to college student Michael Stivic (Reiner)referred to as \"Meathead\" by Archiewhose values are likewise influenced and shaped by the counterculture of the 1960s. The two couples represent the real-life clash of values between the Greatest Generation and Baby Boomers. For much of the series, the Stivics live in the Bunkers' home to save money, providing abundant opportunity for them to irritate each other.\n\nThe show is set in the Astoria section of Queens, with the vast majority of scenes taking place in the Bunkers' home at 704 Hauser Street. Occasional scenes take place in other locations, especially during later seasons, such as Kelsey's Bar, a neighborhood tavern where Archie spends a good deal of time and eventually purchases, and the Stivics' home after Mike and Gloria move out\n\nSupporting characters represent the changing demographics of the neighborhood, especially the Jeffersons, a black family, who live in the house next door in the early seasons.\n\n\n\n\nThe show came about when Norman Lear read an article in \"Variety\" magazine on \"Till Death Us Do Part\" and its success in the United Kingdom. He immediately knew it portrayed a relationship just like the one between his father and himself.\n\nLear bought the rights to the show and incorporated his own family experiences with his father into the show. Lear's father would tell Lear's mother to \"stifle herself\" and she would tell Lear's father \"you are the laziest white man I ever saw\" (two \"Archieisms\" that found their way onto the show).\n\nThe original pilot was titled \"Justice for All\" and was developed for ABC. Tom Bosley, Jack Warden, and Jackie Gleason were all considered for the role of Archie Bunker. In fact, CBS wanted to buy the rights to the original show and retool it specifically for Gleason, who was under contract to them, but producer Lear beat out CBS for the rights and offered the show to ABC. Mickey Rooney was offered the role but turned it down as he felt the character was \"un-American\"\n\nIn the pilot, Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton played Archie and Edith Justice. Kelly Jean Peters played Gloria and Tim McIntire played her husband, Richard. It was taped in October 1968 in New York City. After screening the first pilot, ABC gave the producers more money to shoot a second pilot, titled \"Those Were the Days\", which Lear taped in February 1969 in Hollywood. Candice Azzara played Gloria and Chip Oliver played Richard. D'Urville Martin played Lionel Jefferson in both pilots.\n\nAfter stations' and viewers' complaints caused ABC to cancel \"Turn-On\" after only one episode in February 1969, the network became uneasy about airing a show with a \"foul-mouthed, bigoted lead\" character, and rejected the series at about the time Richard Dreyfuss sought the role of Michael. Rival network CBS was eager to update its image and was looking to replace much of its then popular \"rural\" programming (\"Mayberry R.F.D.\", \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Petticoat Junction\" and \"Green Acres\") with more \"urban\", contemporary series and was interested in Lear's project; by this point, Gleason was no longer under contract to CBS (his own show was among those eliminated), allowing Lear to keep Carroll O'Connor on as the lead. CBS bought the rights from ABC and retitled the show \"All in the Family\". The pilot episode CBS developed had the final cast and was the series' first episode.\n\nLear wanted to shoot in black and white as \"Till Death Us Do Part\" had been. While CBS insisted on color, Lear had the set furnished in neutral tones, keeping everything relatively devoid of color. As costume designer Rita Riggs described in her 2001 Archive of American Television interview, Lear's idea was to create the feeling of sepia tones, in an attempt to make viewers feel as if they were looking at an old family album.\n\n\"All in the Family\" was the first major American series to be videotaped in front of a live studio audience. In the 1960s, most sitcoms had been filmed in the single-camera format without audiences, with a laugh track simulating an audience response. Lear employed the multiple-camera format of shooting in front of an audience, but used tape, whereas previous multiple-camera shows like \"Mary Tyler Moore\" had used film. Due to the success of \"All in the Family\", videotaping sitcoms in front of an audience became a common format for the genre during the 1970s, onward. The use of videotape also gave \"All in the Family\" the look and feel of early live television, including the original live broadcasts of \"The Honeymooners\", to which \"All in the Family\" is sometimes compared.\n\nFor the show's final season, the practice of being taped before a live audience changed to playing the already taped and edited show to an audience and recording their laughter to add to the original sound track, and the voice-over during the end credits were changed from Rob Reiner's voice to Carroll O'Connor's (typically, the audience was gathered for a taping of \"One Day at a Time\", and got to see \"All In the Family\" as a bonus.). Throughout its run, Norman Lear took pride in the fact that canned laughter was never used (mentioning this on many occasions); the laughter heard in the episodes was genuine.\n\nThe series' opening theme song \"Those Were the Days\", was written by Lee Adams (lyrics) and Charles Strouse (music). It was presented in a way that was unique for a 1970s series: Carroll O'Connor and Jean Stapleton were seated at a console or spinet piano (played by Stapleton) and sang the tune together on-camera at the start of every episode, concluding with live-audience applause. (The song dates back to the first \"Justice For All\" pilot filmed in 1968, although on that occasion O'Connor and Stapleton performed the song off-camera and at a faster tempo than the series version.) Six different performances were recorded over the run of the series, including one version that includes additional lyrics. The song is a simple, pentatonic melody (that can be played exclusively with black keys on a piano) in which Archie and Edith wax nostalgic for the simpler days of yesteryear. A longer version of the song was released as a single on Atlantic Records, reaching number 43 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and number 30 on the \"Billboard\" Adult Contemporary chart in early 1972; the additional lyrics in this longer version lend the song a greater sense of sadness, and make poignant reference to social changes taking place in the 1960s and early 1970s.\n\nA few perceptible drifts can be observed when listening to each version chronologically. In the original version, the lyric \"Those Were The Days\" was sung over the tonic (root chord of the song's key), and the piano strikes a dominant 7th passing chord in transition to the next part, which is absent from subsequent versions. Jean Stapleton's screeching high note on the line \"And you knew who you WEEERRE then\" became louder, longer, and more comical, although only in the original version did the line draw a laugh from the audience. Carroll O'Connor's pronunciation of \"welfare state\" gained more of Archie's trademark whining enunciation, and the closing lyrics (especially \"Gee, our old LaSalle ran great\") were sung with increasingly deliberate articulation, as viewers had complained that they could not understand the words. Also in the original version, the camera angle was shot slightly from the right side of the talent as opposed to the straight on angle of the next version. Jean Stapleton performed the theme song without glasses beginning in season 6.\n\nIn addition to O'Connor and Stapleton singing, footage is also shown beginning with aerial shots of Manhattan, and continuing to Queens, progressively zooming in, culminating with a still shot of a lower middle-class semidetached home, presumably representing the Bunkers' house in Astoria. The house shown in the opening credits is actually located at 89–70 Cooper Avenue in the Glendale section of Queens, New York. A notable difference exists, between the Cooper Avenue house and the \"All in the Family\" set: the Cooper Avenue house has no porch, while the Bunkers' home featured a front porch. Since the footage used for the opening had been shot back in 1968 for the series' first pilot, the establishing shot of the Manhattan skyline was completely devoid of the World Trade Center towers, which had not yet been built. When the series aired two years later, the Trade Center towers, although under construction, had still not yet risen high enough to become a prominent feature on the Manhattan skyline (this did not happen until the end of 1971). Despite this change in the Manhattan skyline, the original, somewhat grainy 1968 footage continued to be used for the series opening until the series transitioned into \"Archie Bunker's Place\" in 1979. At that time, a new opening with current shots of the Manhattan skyline were used with the Trade Center towers being seen in the closing credits. This opening format – showing actual footage of the cities and neighborhoods in which the show was set – became the standard for most of Norman Lear's sitcoms, including others in the \"All in the Family\" franchise - \"Maude\", \"Good Times\", and \"The Jeffersons\".\n\nAt the end of the opening, the camera then returns to a few final seconds of O'Connor and Stapleton, as they finish the song. At the end of the original version, Edith smiles at Archie and Archie smiles off at a slight distance. In the longest running version (from season 2 to season 5), Edith smiles blissfully at Archie, and Archie puts a cigar in his mouth and returns a rather cynical, sheepish look to Edith. From season 6 through the season 8, Edith smiles and rests her chin on Archie's shoulder. In the final season, Edith hugs Archie at the conclusion. Additionally, in the first three versions of the opening, Archie is seen wearing his classic trademark white shirt. In the last version of the opening for the series' ninth season, Archie is seen wearing a grey sweater-jacket over his white shirt. In all versions of the opening, the song's conclusion is accompanied by applause from the studio audience.\n\nIn interviews, Norman Lear stated that the idea for the piano song introduction was a cost-cutting measure. After completion of the pilot episode, the budget would not allow an elaborate scene to serve as the sequence played during the show's opening credits. Lear decided to have a simple scene of Archie and Edith singing at the piano.\n\nThe closing theme (an instrumental) was \"Remembering You\" played by Roger Kellaway with lyrics co-written by Carroll O'Connor. It was played over footage of the same row of houses in Queens as in the opening (but moving in the opposite direction down the street), and eventually moving back to aerial shots of Manhattan, suggesting the visit to the Bunkers' home has concluded. O'Connor recorded a vocal version of \"Remembering You\" for a record album, but though he performed it several times on TV appearances, the lyrics (about the end of a romance) were never heard in the actual series.\n\nExcept for some brief instances in the first season, scenes contained no background or transitional music.\n\nThe opening of the animated series \"Family Guy\" is a spoof of this opening, as Peter and Lois Griffin are at the piano in their living room, singing, \"It seems today that all you see/Is violence in movies, and sex on TV/But where are those good old-fashioned values, on which we used to rely?\"\n\nLear and his writers set the series in the Queens neighborhood of Astoria. The location of the Bunkers' house at 704 Hauser Street is fictitious (no Hauser Street exists in Queens). The address is not presented the way addresses are given in Queens: most address numbers are hyphenated, containing the number of the nearest cross street. Nevertheless, many episodes reveal that the Bunkers live near the major thoroughfare Northern Boulevard, which was the location of Kelsey's Bar and later Archie Bunker's Place.\n\nThe façade of the house shown at the show opening is a home located at 89-70 Cooper Avenue, Glendale, Queens, New York, across from St. John Cemetery ().\n\nMany real Queens institutions are mentioned throughout the series. Carroll O’Connor, a Queens native from Forest Hills, said in an interview with the Archive of American Television that he suggested to the writers many of the locations to give the series authenticity. For example, Archie is revealed to have attended Flushing High School, a real high school located in Flushing, Queens (although in the \"Man Of The Year\" episode of \"Archie Bunker's Place\", Archie attended Bryant High School in nearby Long Island City, graduating in 1940). As another example, the 1976 episode \"The Baby Contest\" deals with Archie entering baby Joey in a cutest baby contest sponsored by the \"Long Island Daily Press\", a then-operating local newspaper in Queens and Long Island.\n\nThe writers of \"All in the Family\" continued throughout the series to have the Bunkers and other characters use telephone exchange names when giving a telephone number (most other series at the time, such as \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\", were using the standard fictitious 555 telephone exchange) at a time when the Bell System was trying to discontinue them. At different times throughout the series, the telephone exchanges Ravenswood and Bayside were used for the Bunkers' telephone number. Both exchanges were and still are applicable names for phone numbers in the neighborhoods of Astoria and Bayside. This may have had to do with the fact that at the time many major cities in the United States, such as New York, were resisting the dropping of telephone exchange names in favor of all-number calling, and were still printing their telephone books with exchange names. Actual residents of the Bunkers' age continued using exchange names into the early 1980s. This fact is referred to in the 1979 episode \"The Appendectomy\", when Edith, while dialing a telephone number, uses the Parkview exchange name only to correct herself by saying that she keeps forgetting that it is all-number dialing now. She comes to the conclusion that the number is exactly the same either way.\n\n\"Sammy's Visit,\" first broadcast in February 1972, is a particularly notable episode, whose famous episode-ending scene produced the longest sustained audience laughter in the history of the show. Guest star Sammy Davis, Jr. plays himself. Archie is moonlighting as a cab driver and Davis visits the Bunker home to retrieve a briefcase he left in Archie's cab earlier that day. After hearing Archie's bigoted remarks, Davis asks for a photograph with him. At the moment the picture is taken, Davis suddenly kisses a stunned Archie on the cheek. The ensuing laughter went on for so long that it had to be severely edited for network broadcast, as Carroll O'Connor still had one line (\"Well, what the hell — he said it was in his contract!\") to deliver after the kiss. (The line is usually cut in syndication.)\n\nDuring the show's sixth season, starting on December 1, 1975, CBS began airing reruns on weekdays at 3p.m. (EST), replacing long-running soap opera \"The Edge of Night\", which moved to ABC. The show would later move to 3:30p.m. and in September 1978, 10a.m. This lasted until September 1979, when Viacom distributed the reruns to the off-network market where many stations picked-up the show. In 1991, Columbia Pictures Television began syndicating the show, and Columbia's successor companies have continued to do so.\n\nSince the late 1980s, \"All in the Family\" has been rerun on various cable and satellite networks including TBS (although it held the rights locally in Atlanta, as well), TV Land, Nick at Nite, and Sundance TV. From January 3, 2011, to December 31, 2017, the show aired on Antenna TV. As of January 1, 2018, the show began to air on GetTV.\n\nThe cast forfeited their residual rights for a cash payout early in the production run.\n\n\"All in the Family\" is one of three television shows (\"The Cosby Show\" and \"American Idol\" being the others) that have been number one in the Nielsen ratings for five consecutive TV seasons. The show remained in the top 10 for seven of its nine seasons.\nThe series finale was seen by 40.2 million viewers.\n\nAccording to \"The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present\", \"All in the Family\" has the most spin-offs for a prime-time television series, directly spawning five other shows, three of which were very successful, as well as two of spin-offs each having a spin-off of its own.\n\n\nAt the height of the show's popularity, Henry Fonda hosted a special one-hour retrospective of \"All in the Family\" and its impact on American television. It included clips from the show's most memorable episodes up to that time. It was titled \"The Best of \"All in the Family\"\", and aired on December 21, 1974.\n\nOn February 16, 1991, CBS aired a 90-minute retrospective, \"All in the Family 20th Anniversary Special\", hosted by Norman Lear to commemorate the show's 20th anniversary. It featured a compilation of clips from the show's best moments, and interviews with the four main cast members. The special was so well received by the viewing audience CBS aired reruns of \"All in the Family\" during its summer schedule in 1991, garnering higher ratings than the new series scheduled next to it, Norman Lear's sitcom \"Sunday Dinner\". The latter was Lear's return to TV series producing after a seven-year absence, and was cancelled after the six-week tryout run due to being poorly received by audiences.\n\nOn May 22, 2019, ABC broadcast \"Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons\", produced by Lear and Jimmy Kimmel and starring Woody Harrelson, Marisa Tomei, Jamie Foxx, Wanda Sykes, Ike Barinholtz, Kerry Washington and Ellie Kemper.\n\nA second \"Live in Front of A Studio Audience\" special was announced in early November 2019 to air on Wednesday December 18, this time pairing the show with \"Good Times\".\n\nSony Pictures Home Entertainment (formerly Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment) released the first six seasons of \"All in the Family\" on DVD in Region 1 between 2002 and 2007. No further seasons were released, because the sales figures did not match Sony's expectations.\n\nOn June 23, 2010, Shout! Factory announced that it had acquired the rights to the series, and has since released the remaining three seasons.\n\nOn October 30, 2012, Shout! Factory released \"All in the Family - The Complete Series\" on DVD in Region 1. The 28-disc boxed set features all 208 episodes of the series, as well as bonus features.\n\nOn February 6, 2018, Sony released \"All in the Family- Seasons 1-5\" on DVD in Region 1. The 15-disc set features all episodes from the first five seasons.\n\nAs one of US television's most acclaimed and groundbreaking programs, \"All in the Family\" has been referenced or parodied in countless other forms of media. References on other sitcoms include \"That '70s Show\" and \"The Simpsons\". The animated series \"Family Guy\" pays homage to \"All in the Family\" in the opening sequence which features Peter and Lois Griffin playing the piano and singing a lament on the loss of traditional values, and also paid tribute to the show's closing credits sequence at the end of the season 5 episode \"Stewie Loves Lois\".\n\nPopular T-shirts, buttons, and bumper stickers showing O'Connor's image and farcically promoting \"Archie Bunker for President\" appeared around the time of the 1972 presidential election. In 1998, \"All in the Family\" was honored on a 33-cent stamp by the USPS.\n\nArchie and Edith Bunker's chairs are on display in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The originals had been purchased by the show's set designer for a few dollars at a local Goodwill thrift store, and were given to the Smithsonian (for an exhibit on American television history) in 1978. It cost producers thousands of dollars to create replicas to replace the originals.\n\nThen-US President Richard Nixon can be heard discussing the show (specifically the 1971 episodes \"Writing the President\" and \"Judging Books by Covers\") on one of the infamous Watergate tapes.\n\nRapper Redman has made references to Archie Bunker in a few of his songs, specifically his smoking of large cigars.\n\n\"All in the Family\" is the first of four sitcoms in which all the lead actors (O'Connor, Stapleton, Struthers, and Reiner) won Primetime Emmy Awards. The other three are \"The Golden Girls\", \"The Simpsons\", and \"Will and Grace\".\n\n\n\nIn 2013, the Television Critics Association honored \"All in the Family\" with its Heritage Award for its cultural and social impact on society.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "191890", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=191890", "title": "American Idol", "text": "American Idol\n\nAmerican Idol is an American singing competition television series created by Simon Fuller, produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, and distributed by Fremantle North America. It initially aired on Fox from June 11, 2002, to April 7, 2016, for 15 seasons. It had a hiatus for two years, until March 11, 2018, when a revival of the series aired on ABC.\n\nIt started as an addition to the \"Idols\" format that was based on \"Pop Idol\" from British television, and became one of the most successful shows in the history of American television. The concept of the series involves discovering recording stars from unsigned singing talents, with the winner determined by American viewers using phones, Internet, and SMS text voting. The winners of the first seventeen seasons, as chosen by viewers, are Kelly Clarkson, Ruben Studdard, Fantasia Barrino, Carrie Underwood, Taylor Hicks, Jordin Sparks, David Cook, Kris Allen, Lee DeWyze, Scotty McCreery, Phillip Phillips, Candice Glover, Caleb Johnson, Nick Fradiani, Trent Harmon, Maddie Poppe, and Laine Hardy respectively.\n\n\"American Idol\" employs a panel of vocal judges who critique the contestants' performances. The original judges, for the first through eighth seasons, were record producer and music manager Randy Jackson, singer and choreographer Paula Abdul, and music executive and manager Simon Cowell. The judging panel for the last three seasons on Fox consisted of singers Keith Urban, Jennifer Lopez, and Harry Connick Jr. The sixteenth season brought three new judges: singers Lionel Richie, Katy Perry, and Luke Bryan. The first season was hosted by radio personality Ryan Seacrest and comedian Brian Dunkleman, but Seacrest remained as the sole master of ceremonies for the rest of the series. \n\nThe success of \"American Idol\" has been described as \"unparalleled in broadcasting history\". A rival TV executive said the series was \"the most impactful show in the history of television\". It became a recognized springboard for launching the career of many artists as bona fide stars. According to \"Billboard\" magazine, in its first ten years, \"\"Idol\" has spawned 345 \"Billboard\" chart-toppers and a platoon of pop idols, including Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Chris Daughtry, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, Jennifer Hudson, Clay Aiken, Adam Lambert, and Jordin Sparks while remaining a TV ratings juggernaut.\"\n\nFor an unprecedented eight consecutive years, from the 2003–04 television season through the 2010–11 season, either its performance show or result show was ranked number one in U.S. television ratings.\n\n\"American Idol\" was based on the British show \"Pop Idol\" created by Simon Fuller, which was in turn inspired by the New Zealand television singing competition \"Popstars\". Television producer Nigel Lythgoe saw a version in Australia and helped bring it over to Britain. Fuller was inspired by the idea from \"Popstars\" of employing a panel of judges to select singers in audition. He then added other elements, including telephone voting by the viewing public (which at the time was already in use in shows, such as the \"Eurovision Song Contest\"), the drama of backstories, and real-life soap opera unfolding in real time. \"Pop Idol\" debuted in Britain in 2001 with Lythgoe as showrunnerthe executive producer and production leaderand Simon Cowell as one of the judges, and was successful with the viewing public.\n\nIn 2001, Fuller, Cowell, and TV producer Simon Jones attempted to sell the \"Pop Idol\" format to the United States, but the idea was initially met with poor responses from all the television networks including Fox. However, Rupert Murdoch, head of Fox's parent company, was later persuaded to buy the series by his daughter, Elisabeth, who had seen the British show. Although Fox's executives wanted to change the format, Murdoch insisted that it should remain the same as the British one. One change was nevertheless made due to the presence of multiple time zones in the United States that made it impractical for the country to vote in the same time period, an additional half-hour results show was therefore added the day following the performance show. The show was renamed \"American Idol: The Search for a Superstar\" and debuted in the summer of 2002. Cowell was initially offered the job of showrunner, but turned down the offer; Lythgoe then took over that position. Much to the surprise of Cowell and Fox, it became one of the biggest shows of the summer. With its successful launch in the summer, the show was then moved to January and expanded. The show grew into a phenomenon largely due to its personal engagement with the contestants by prompting the viewers to vote, and the presence of the acid-tongued Cowell as a judge. By 2004, it had become the most-watched show on U.S. television, a position it then held for seven consecutive seasons.\n\nHowever, after a few years of sharp declining ratings starting in 2012, with rating falls of over 20% each season, the fifteenth season would be its last, ending its run in April 2016. In May 2017, ABC acquired the rights to the series and the program returned for the 2017–18 television season. ABC announced in May 2019 that American Idol will be returning for its eighteenth season.\n\nThe show had originally planned on having four judges following the \"Pop Idol\" format; however, only three judges had been found by the time of the audition round in the first season, namely Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Simon Cowell. A fourth judge, radio DJ Stryker, was originally chosen but he dropped out citing \"image concerns\". In the second season, New York radio personality Angie Martinez had been hired as a fourth judge but withdrew only after a few days of auditions due to not being comfortable with giving out criticism. The show decided to continue with the three judges format until the eighth season. All three original judges stayed on the judging panel for eight seasons.\n\nIn the eighth season, Latin Grammy Award-nominated singer-songwriter and record producer Kara DioGuardi was added as a fourth judge. She stayed for two seasons and left the show before the tenth season. Paula Abdul left the show before the ninth season after failing to agree to terms with the show producers. Emmy Award-winning talk show host Ellen DeGeneres replaced Paula Abdul for that season, but left after just one season. On January 11, 2010, Simon Cowell left the show to pursue introducing the American version of his show \"The X Factor\" for 2011.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined the judging panel in the tenth season, but both left after two seasons. They were replaced by three new judges, Mariah Carey, Nicki Minaj and Keith Urban, who joined Randy Jackson in the twelfth season. However both Carey and Minaj left after one season, and Randy Jackson departed the show after twelve seasons as a judge but would return as a mentor. Urban was the only judge from the tweflth season to return in the thirteenth. He was joined by previous judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick Jr. Lopez, Urban and Connick, Jr. all returned as judges for the show's fourteenth and fifteenth seasons.\n\nKaty Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie were the judges on the sixteenth through eighteenth seasons.\n\nGuest judges may occasionally be introduced. In the second season, guest judges such as Lionel Richie and Robin Gibb were used, and in the third season Donna Summer, Quentin Tarantino and some of the mentors also joined as judges to critique the performances in the final rounds. Guest judges were used in the audition rounds, Gene Simmons and LL Cool J in the fourth season, Carole Bayer Sager, Jewel and Olivia Newton-John in the sixth season, Shania Twain in the eighth season, Neil Patrick Harris, Avril Lavigne and Katy Perry in the ninth season and Adam Lambert in the fourteenth season.\n\nThe first season was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman following the format of \"Pop Idol\" of using two presenters. Dunkleman quit thereafter, making Seacrest the sole emcee of the show starting with the second season. Dunkleman did, however, return in the initial series finale on Fox. Seacrest returned for the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth seasons. On April 8, 2019, Bobby Bones subbed for Ryan when he was out sick.\n\nIn a series of steps, the show selected the eventual winner out of many tens of thousands of contestants.\n\nThe eligible age-range for contestants is fifteen to twenty-eight years old. The initial age limit was sixteen to twenty-four in the first three seasons, but the upper limit was raised to twenty-eight in the fourth season, and the lower limit was reduced to fifteen in the tenth season. The contestants have to be legal U.S. residents, can not have advanced to particular stages of the competition in previous seasons, and must not have held a current recording or talent representation contract by the semi-final stage (in previous years by the audition stage).\nContestants went through at least three sets of cuts. The first was a brief audition with a few other contestants in front of selectors which may include one of the show's producers. Although auditions can exceed 10,000 in each city, only a few hundred of these made it past the preliminary round of auditions. Successful contestants then sang in front of producers, where more may be cut. Only then can they proceed to audition in front of the judges, which is the only audition stage shown on television. Those selected by the judges are sent to Hollywood. Between 10–60 people in each city may make it to Hollywood.\n\nOnce in Hollywood, the contestants performed individually or in groups in a series of rounds. Until the tenth season, there were usually three rounds of eliminations in Hollywood. In the first round the contestants emerged in groups but performed individually. For the next round, the contestants put themselves in small groups and performed a song together. In the final round, the contestants performed solo with a song of their choice a cappella or accompanied by a banddepending on the season. In the second and third seasons, contestants were also asked to write original lyrics or melody in an additional round after the first round. In the seventh season, the group round was eliminated and contestants may, after a first solo performance and on judges approval, skip a second solo round and move directly to the final Hollywood round. In the twelfth season, the executive producers split up the females and males and chose the members to form the groups in the group round.\n\nIn the tenth and eleventh seasons, a further round was added in Las Vegas, where the contestants performed in groups based on a theme, followed by one final solo round to determine the semi-finalists. At the end of this stage of the competition, 24 to 36 contestants were selected to move on to the semi-final stage. In the twelfth season the Las Vegas round became a Sudden Death round, where the judges had to choose five guys and five girls each night (four nights) to make the top twenty. In the thirteenth season, the Las Vegas round was eliminated and a new round called \"Hollywood or Home\" was added, where if the judges were uncertain about some contestants, those contestants were required to perform soon after landing in Los Angeles, and those who failed to impress were sent back home before they reached Hollywood. In the fourteenth season, a Showcase round was added, where the contestants performed at a LA nightclub or auditorium for the judges and a live audience, and these performances determine who makes into the Top 24. In the seventeenth season, the showcase round took place in Hawaii.\n\nFrom the semi-finals onward, the fate of the contestants was decided by public vote. During the contestant's performance as well as the recap at the end, a toll-free telephone number for each contestant was displayed on the screen. For a two-hour period after the episode ends (up to four hours for the finale) in each US time zone, viewers may call or send a text message to their preferred contestant's telephone number, and each call or text message was registered as a vote for that contestant. Viewers were allowed to vote as many times as they can within the two-hour voting window. However, the show reserves the right to discard votes by power dialers. One or more of the least popular contestants may be eliminated in successive weeks until a winner emerges. Over 110 million votes were cast in the first season, and by the tenth season the seasonal total had increased to nearly 750 million. Voting via text messaging was made available in the second season when AT&T Wireless joined as a sponsor of the show, and 7.5 million text messages were sent to \"American Idol\" that season. The number of text messages rapidly increased, reaching 178 million texts by the eighth season. Online voting was offered for the first time in the tenth season. The votes are counted and verified by Telescope Inc.\n\nIn the first three seasons, the semi-finalists were split into different groups to perform individually in their respective night. In the first season, there were three groups of ten, with the top three contestants from each group making the finals. In the second and third seasons, there were four groups of eight, and the top two of each selected. These seasons also featured a wildcard round, where contestants who failed to qualify were given another chance. In the first season, only one wildcard contestant was chosen by the judges, giving a total of ten finalists. In the second and third seasons, each of the three judges championed one contestant with the public advancing a fourth into the finals, making 12 finalists in all.\n\nFrom the fourth through seventh and ninth seasons, the twenty-four semi-finalists were divided by gender in order to ensure an equal gender division in the top twelve. The men and women sang separately on consecutive nights, and the bottom two in each groups were eliminated each week until only six of each remained to form the top twelve.\n\nThe wildcard round returned in the eighth season, wherein there were three groups of twelve, with three contestants moving forward – the highest male, the highest female, and the next highest-placed singer – for each night, and four wildcards were chosen by the judges to produce a final 13. Starting in tenth season, the girls and boys perform on separate nights. In the tenth and eleventh seasons, five of each gender were chosen, and three wildcards were chosen by the judges to form a final 13. In the twelfth season, the top twenty semifinalists were split into gender groups, with five of each gender advancing to form the final 10. In the thirteenth season, there were thirty semifinalists, but only twenty semifinalists (ten for each gender) were chosen by the judges to perform on the live shows, with five in each gender based on the vote and three wildcards chosen by the judges composing the final 13. In the fourteenth season, the top 24 performed at The Fillmore Detroit, starting with the 12 males on one night and then the 12 females on the next night. The following week, the same order went for the top 16, with four males eliminated, followed by four females based on the vote. Then, on the first night of finals, a similar sequence from the thirteenth season was used to determine the final 12, with five of each gender based on the vote and two wildcards chosen by the judges. In the fifteenth season, the top 24 performed at Cathedral of Saint Vibiana in Los Angeles and were split into two groups of twelve and performed twice, one being a solo performance and one being a duet with a former Idol contestant. In each group, the judges chose 7 contestants to advance to the top 14 where the judges chose 4 to advance to the top 10 and remaining 6 contestants were chosen based on the vote. In the sixteenth season, the top 24 performed at the Academy in the Heart of LA, and the show repeated the process from the previous season. However, instead of Idol alumnus as duet partners, superstar celebrity singers were used as the duet partners. In the seventeenth season, the show repeated the process again. However, instead of a top 24, it's a top 20, the contestants performed at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, and performed solos in one episode, and performed the duets in two episodes.\n\nThe finals were broadcast in prime time from CBS Television City in Los Angeles, in front of a live studio audience. The finals lasted eight weeks in the first season. From the second to ninth and fourteenth seasons, the finals lasted eleven weeks. The tenth and eleventh seasons lasted for twelve weeks, while the twelfth season lasted for ten weeks. In the thirteenth season, the finals lasted thirteen weeks. The finals lasted seven weeks in the fifteenth season, and six weeks in the sixteenth season. Each finalist performs songs based on a weekly theme which may be a musical genre such as Motown, disco, or big band, songs by artists such as Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley or The Beatles, or more general themes such as \"Billboard\" number-one hits or songs from the contestant's year of birth. Contestants usually worked with a celebrity mentor related to the theme. In the tenth season, Jimmy Iovine was brought in as a mentor for the season. Initially the contestants sang one song each week, but this was increased to two songs from top four or five onwards, then three songs for the top two or three.\n\nThe most popular contestants were usually not revealed in the results show. Instead, typically the three contestants (two in later rounds) who received the lowest number of votes was called to the center of the stage. One of these three was usually sent to safety; however the two remaining were not necessarily the bottom two. The contestant with the fewest votes was then revealed and eliminated from the competition. A montage of the eliminated contestant's time on the show was played and they gave their final performance (from the fourteenth season onward, the montage and the final performance were dropped). However, in the sixth season, during the series' first ever Idol Gives Back episode, no contestant was eliminated, but on the following week, two were sent home. Moreover, starting in eighth season, the judges may overturn viewers' decision with a \"Judges' Save\" if they unanimously agreed to. \"The save\" could only be used once, and only up through the top five. In the eighth to tenth and fourteenth seasons, a double elimination then took place in the week following the activation of the save, but in the eleventh and thirteenth seasons, a regular single elimination took place. The save was not activated in the twelfth season and consequently, a non-elimination took place in the week after its expiration with the votes then carrying over into the following week.\n\nThe \"Fan Save\" was introduced in the fourteenth season. During the finals, viewers were given a five-minute window to vote for the contestants in danger of elimination by using their Twitter account to decide which contestant will move on to the next show, starting with the Top 8.\n\nThe finale was the two-hour last episode of the season, culminating in revealing the winner. For the first, third through sixth and fourteenth through fifteenth seasons it was broadcast from the Dolby Theatre, which has an audience capacity of approximately 3,400. The second-season finale took place at the Gibson Amphitheatre, which had an audience capacity of over 6,000. In the seventh through thirteenth seasons, the venue was at the Nokia Theater, which holds an audience of over 7,000. In the sixteenth and seventeenth seasons, the venue did not change from the Finals.\n\nThe winner received a record deal with a major label, which may be for up to six albums, and secures a management contract with \"American Idol\"-affiliated 19 Management (which has the right of first refusal to sign all contestants), as well as various lucrative contracts. All winners prior to the ninth season reportedly earned at least $1 million in their first year as winner. At first the contract came with a $250,000-plus advance, but dropped to about $62,500 over the Fox years. All the runners-up of the first ten seasons, as well as some of other finalists, had also received record deals with major labels. However, starting in the eleventh season, the runner-up may only be guaranteed a single-only deal. BMG/Sony (first through ninth seasons), UMG (tenth through fifteenth seasons), and Disney Music Group's Hollywood Records (sixteenth season onward) had the right of first refusal to sign contestants for three months after the season's finale. In the fourteenth season, the winner was signed with Big Machine Records as the winner, Trent Harmon, was more country. Prominent music mogul Clive Davis also produced some of the selected contestants' albums, such as Kelly Clarkson, Clay Aiken, Fantasia Barrino and Diana DeGarmo. All top 10 (11 in the tenth and twelfth seasons, 5 in the fourteenth season, and 7 in the sixteenth season) finalists earn the privilege of going on a tour, where the participants may each earn a six-figure sum.\n\nEach season premieres with the audition round, taking place in different cities. The audition episodes typically feature a mix of potential finalists, interesting characters and woefully inadequate contestants. Each successful contestant receives a golden ticket to proceed on to the next round in Hollywood. Based on their performances during the Hollywood round (Las Vegas round from the tenth through twelfth seasons), 24 to 36 contestants are selected by the judges to participate in the semifinals. From the semifinals onward the contestants perform their songs live, with the judges making their critiques after each performance. The contestants are voted for by the viewing public, and the outcome of the public votes is then revealed during a results segment. The results segment feature group performances by the contestants as well as guest performers. The Top-three results also features homecoming events for the Top 3 finalists. The season reaches its climax in a two-hour results finale show, where the winner of the season is revealed.\n\nWith the exception of the first two seasons, the contestants in the semifinals onward perform in front of a studio audience. They perform with a full band in the finals. The current musical director is Kris Pooley, who has been with the show since the sixteenth season. In previous seasons, the \"American Idol\" band was led by Rickey Minor (fourth through ninth and thirteenth through fifteenth seasons) and Ray Chew (tenth through twelfth seasons). Assistance has also been given by vocal coaches and song arrangers, such as Michael Orland and Debra Byrd to contestants behind the scene. Starting with the seventh season, contestants may perform with a musical instrument from the Hollywood rounds onward. In later seasons, the contestants were allowed to perform with a musical instrument in the auditions. During the first nine seasons, performances were usually aired live on Tuesday nights, followed by the results shows on Wednesdays, but moved to Wednesdays and Thursdays from the tenth through thirteenth seasons. From the fourteenth season onward, there were no separate results shows. On the fourteenth season, the show aired on Wednesday nights, and on the fifteenth season, Thursday nights. From the sixteenth season onward, it aired on Sundays and Mondays.\n\nThe first season of \"American Idol\" debuted as a summer replacement show in June 2002 on the Fox network. It was co-hosted by Ryan Seacrest and Brian Dunkleman.\n\nIn the audition rounds, 121 contestants were selected from around 10,000 who attended the auditions. These were cut to 30 for the semifinal, with ten going on to the finals. One semifinalist, Delano Cagnolatti, was disqualified for lying to evade the show's age limit. One of the early favorites, Tamyra Gray, was eliminated at the top four, the first of several such shock eliminations that were to be repeated in later seasons. Christina Christian was hospitalized before the top six result show due to chest pains and palpitations, and she was eliminated while she was in the hospital. Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show; his sexual orientation was revealed on his blog, however it was removed during the competition after a request from the show producers over concerns that it might be unfairly influencing votes.\n\nThe final showdown was between Justin Guarini, one of the early favorites, and Kelly Clarkson. Clarkson was not initially thought of as a contender, but impressed the judges with some good performances in the final rounds, such as her performance of Aretha Franklin's \"Natural Woman\", and Betty Hutton's \"Stuff Like That There\", and eventually won the crown on September 4, 2002.\n\nIn what was to become a tradition, Clarkson performed the coronation song during the finale, and released the song immediately after the season ended. The single, \"A Moment Like This\", went on to break a 38-year-old record held by The Beatles for the biggest leap to number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. Guarini did not release any song immediately after the show and remains the only runner-up not to do so. Both Clarkson and Guarini made a musical film, \"From Justin to Kelly\", which was released in 2003 but was widely panned. Clarkson has since become the most successful \"Idol\" contestant internationally, with worldwide album sales of more than 23 million.\n\nStarting September 30, 2006, this season was repackaged as \"American Idol Rewind\" and syndicated directly to stations in the U.S.\n\nFollowing the success of the first season, the second season was moved up to air in January 2003. The number of episodes increased, as did the show's budget and the charge for commercial spots. Dunkleman left the show, leaving Seacrest as the lone host. Kristin Adams was a correspondent for this season.\n\nCorey Clark was disqualified during the finals for having an undisclosed police record; however, he later alleged that he and Paula Abdul had an affair while on the show and that this contributed to his expulsion. Clark also claimed that Abdul gave him preferential treatment on the show due to their affair. The allegations were dismissed by Fox after an independent investigation. Two semi-finalists were also disqualified that year – Jaered Andrews for an arrest on an assault charge, and Frenchie Davis for having previously modelled for an adult website.\n\nRuben Studdard emerged as the winner, beating Clay Aiken by a small margin. Out of a total of 24 million votes, Studdard finished just 134,000 votes ahead of Aiken. This slim margin of victory was controversial due to the large number of calls that failed to get through. In an interview prior to the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe indicated that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wildcard week onward until the finale.\n\nBoth finalists found success after the show, but Aiken out-performed Studdard's coronation song \"Flying Without Wings\" with his single release from the show \"This Is the Night\", as well as in their subsequent album releases. The fourth-place finisher Josh Gracin also enjoyed some success as a country singer.\n\nThe third season premiered on January 19, 2004. One of the most talked-about contestants during the audition process was William Hung whose off-key rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\" received widespread attention. His exposure on \"Idol\" landed him a record deal and surprisingly he became the third best-selling singer from that season.\n\nMuch media attention on the season had been focused on the three black singers, Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas. All three unexpectedly landed on the bottom three on the top seven result show, with Hudson controversially eliminated. Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes \"incredibly racist\". The prolonged stays of John Stevens and Jasmine Trias in the finals, despite negative comments from the judges, had aroused resentment, so much so that John Stevens reportedly received a death threat, which he dismissed as a joke 'blown out of proportion'.\n\nThe performance of \"Summertime\" by Barrino, later known simply as \"Fantasia\", at Top 8 was widely praised, and Simon Cowell considered it as his favorite \"Idol\" moment in the nine seasons he was on the show. Fantasia and Diana DeGarmo were the last two finalists, and Fantasia was crowned as the winner. Fantasia released as her coronation single \"I Believe\", a song co-written by the first season finalist Tamyra Gray, and DeGarmo released \"Dreams\".\n\nThe fourth season premiered on January 18, 2005; this was the first season of the series to be aired in high definition, although the finale of the third season was also aired in high definition. The number of those attending the auditions by now had increased to over 100,000 from the 10,000 of the first season. The age limit was raised to 28 in this season, and among those who benefited from this new rule were Constantine Maroulis and Bo Bice, the two rockers of the show.\n\nThe top 12 finalists originally included Mario Vazquez, but he dropped out citing 'personal reasons' and was replaced by Nikko Smith. Later, an employee of Freemantle Media, which produces the show, sued the company for wrongful termination, claiming that he was dismissed after complaining about lewd behavior by Vazquez toward him during the show.\n\nDuring the top 11 week, due to a mix-up with the contestants' telephone number, voting was repeated on what was normally the result night, with the result reveal postponed until the following night.\n\nIn May 2005, Carrie Underwood was announced the winner, with Bice the runner-up. Both Underwood and Bice released the coronation song \"Inside Your Heaven\", with Underwood's version of the song making her the first country artist ever to debut at number-one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart. As of 2015, Underwood has become the most successful \"Idol\" contestant in the U.S., selling 16 million albums in the country, while selling a total of 65 million records worldwide.\n\nThe fifth season began on January 17, 2006. It remains the highest-rated season in the show's run so far. Two of the more prominent contestants during the Hollywood round were the Brittenum twins who were later disqualified for identity theft.\n\nChris Daughtry's performance of Fuel's \"Hemorrhage (In My Hands)\" on the show was widely praised and led to an invitation to join the band as Fuel's new lead singer, an invitation he declined. His performance of Live's version of \"I Walk the Line\" was well received by the judges but later criticized in some quarters for not crediting the arrangement to Live. He was eliminated at the top four in a shocking result.\n\nOn May 30, 2006, Taylor Hicks was named \"American Idol\", with Katharine McPhee the runner-up. \"Do I Make You Proud\" was released as Hicks' first single and McPhee's was \"My Destiny\".\n\nDespite being eliminated earlier in the season, Chris Daughtry (as lead of the band Daughtry) became the most successful recording artist from this season. Other contestants, such as Hicks, McPhee, Bucky Covington, Mandisa, Kellie Pickler, and Elliott Yamin have had varying levels of success.\n\nThe sixth season began on Tuesday, January 16, 2007. The premiere drew a massive audience of 37.3 million viewers, peaking in the last half hour with more than 41 million viewers.\n\nTeenager Sanjaya Malakar was the season's most talked-about contestant for his unusual hairdo, and for managing to survive elimination for many weeks due in part to the weblog Vote for the Worst and satellite radio personality Howard Stern, who both encouraged fans to vote for him. However, on the Top 7 results, Sanjaya was voted off.\n\nThis season saw the first \"Idol Gives Back\" telethon-inspired event, which raised more than $76 million in corporate and viewer donations. No contestant was eliminated that week, but two (Phil Stacey and Chris Richardson) were eliminated the next.\n\nIn the May 23 season finale, Jordin Sparks was declared the winner with the runner-up being Blake Lewis. Sparks has had some success as a recording artist post-\"Idol\".\n\nThis season also saw the launch of the \"American Idol\" Songwriter contest which allows fans to vote for the \"coronation song\". Thousands of recordings of original songs were submitted by songwriters, and 20 entries selected for the public vote. The winning song, \"This Is My Now\", was performed by both finalists during the finale and released by Sparks on May 24, 2007.\n\nThe seventh season premiered on January 15, 2008, for a two-day, four-hour premiere. The media focused on the professional status of the seventh season contestants, the so-called 'ringers', many of whom, including Kristy Lee Cook, Brooke White, Michael Johns, and in particular Carly Smithson, had prior recording contracts. Contestant David Hernandez also attracted some attention due to his past employment as a stripper.\n\nFor the finals, \"American Idol\" debuted a new state-of-the-art set and stage on March 11, 2008, along with a new on-air look. David Cook's performance of \"Billie Jean\" on top-ten night was lauded by the judges, but provoked controversy when they apparently mistook the Chris Cornell arrangement to be David Cook's own even though the performance was introduced as Cornell's version. Cornell himself said he was 'flattered' and praised David Cook's performance. David Cook was taken to the hospital after the top-nine performance show due to heart palpitations and high blood pressure.\n\nDavid Archuleta's performance of John Lennon's \"Imagine\" was considered by many as one of the best of the season. Jennifer Lopez, who was brought in as a judge in the tenth season, called it a beautiful song-moment that she will never forget. Jason Castro's semi-final performance of \"Hallelujah\" also received considerable attention, and it propelled Jeff Buckley's version of the song to the top of the \"Billboard\" digital song chart. This was the first season in which contestants' recordings were released onto iTunes after their performances, and although sales information was not released so as not to prejudice the contest, leaked information indicated that contestants' songs frequently reached the top of iTunes sales charts.\n\n\"Idol Gives Back\" returned on April 9, 2008, and raised $64 million for charity.\n\nThe finalists were Cook and Archuleta. David Cook was announced the winner on May 21, 2008, the first rocker to win the show. Both Cook and Archuleta had some success as recording artists with both selling over a million albums in the U.S.\n\nThe \"American Idol\" Songwriter contest was also held this season. From ten of the most popular submissions, each of the final two contestants chose a song to perform, although neither of their selections was used as the \"coronation song\". The winning song, \"The Time of My Life\", was recorded by David Cook and released on May 22, 2008.\n\nThe eighth season premiered on January 13, 2009. Mike Darnell, the president of alternative programming for Fox, stated that the season would focus more on the contestants' personal life.\n\nIn the first major change to the judging panel, a fourth judge, Kara DioGuardi, was introduced. This was also the first season without executive producer Nigel Lythgoe who left to focus on the international versions of his show \"So You Think You Can Dance\". The Hollywood round was moved to the Kodak Theatre for 2009 and was also extended to two weeks. \"Idol Gives Back\" was canceled for this season due to the global recession at the time.\n\nThere were 13 finalists this season, but two were eliminated in the first result show of the finals. A new feature introduced was the \"Judges' Save\", and Matt Giraud was saved from elimination at the top seven by the judges when he received the fewest votes. The next week, Lil Rounds and Anoop Desai were eliminated.\n\nThe two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since the second season. It was claimed, and then later retracted, that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.\n\nBoth Allen and Lambert released the coronation song, \"No Boundaries\" which was co-written by DioGuardi. This is the first season in which the winner failed to achieve gold album status.\n\nThe ninth season premiered on January 12, 2010. The upheaval at the judging panel continued. Ellen DeGeneres joined as a judge to replace Paula Abdul at the start of Hollywood Week.\n\nOne of the most prominent auditioners this season was General Larry Platt whose performance of \"Pants on the Ground\" became a viral hit song.\n\nCrystal Bowersox, who has Type-I diabetes, fell ill due to diabetic ketoacidosis on the morning of the girls performance night for the top 20 week and was hospitalized. The schedule was rearranged so the boys performed first and she could perform the following night instead; she later revealed that Ken Warwick, the show producer, wanted to disqualify her but she begged to be allowed to stay on the show.\n\nMichael Lynche was the lowest vote getter at top nine and was given the Judges' Save. The next week Katie Stevens and Andrew Garcia were eliminated. That week, Adam Lambert was invited back to be a mentor, the first \"Idol\" alum to do so. \"Idol Gives Back\" returned this season on April 21, 2010, and raised $45 million.\n\nA special tribute to Simon Cowell was presented in the finale for his final season with the show. Many figures from the show's past, including Paula Abdul, made an appearance.\n\nThe final two contestants were Lee DeWyze and Bowersox. DeWyze was declared the winner during the May 26 finale. No new song was used as coronation song this year; instead, the two finalists each released a cover song – DeWyze chose U2's \"Beautiful Day\", and Bowersox chose Patty Griffin's \"Up to the Mountain\". This is the first season where neither finalist achieved significant album sales.\n\nThe tenth season of the series premiered on January 19, 2011. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the American version of \"The X Factor\"), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, while Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of \"American Idol\", acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors, although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyoncé, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.\n\nThe tenth season is the first to include online auditions where contestants could submit a 40-second video audition via Myspace. Karen Rodriguez was one such auditioner and reached the final rounds.\n\nOne of the more prominent contestants this year was Chris Medina, whose story of caring for his brain-damaged fiancée received widespread coverage. Medina was cut in the Top 40 round. Casey Abrams, who suffers from ulcerative colitis, was hospitalized twice and missed the Top 13 result show. The judges used their one save on Abrams on the Top 11, and as a result this was the first season that 11 finalists went on tour instead of 10. In the following week, Naima Adedapo and Thia Megia were both eliminated.\n\nPia Toscano, one of the presumed favorites to advance far in the season, was unexpectedly eliminated on April 7, 2011, finishing in ninth place. Her elimination drew criticisms from some former \"Idol\" contestants, as well as actor Tom Hanks.\n\nThe two finalists in 2011 were Lauren Alaina and Scotty McCreery, both teenage country singers. McCreery won the competition on May 25, being the youngest male winner and the fourth male in a row to win \"American Idol\". McCreery released his first single, \"I Love You This Big\", as his coronation song, and Alaina released \"Like My Mother Does\". McCreery's debut album, \"Clear as Day\", became the first debut album by an \"Idol\" winner to reach No. 1 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 since Ruben Studdard's \"Soulful\" in 2003, and he became the youngest male artist to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe eleventh season premiered on January 18, 2012. One more finalist would join the Top 24 making it the Top 25, and that was Jermaine Jones. However, on March 14, Jones was disqualified in 12th place for concealing arrests and outstanding warrants. Jones denied the accusation that he concealed his arrests.\n\nFinalist Phillip Phillips suffered from kidney pain and was taken to the hospital before the Top 13 results show, and later received medical procedure to alleviate a blockage caused by kidney stones. He was reported to have eight surgeries during his Idol run, and had considered quitting the show due to the pain. He underwent surgery to remove the stones and reconstruct his kidney soon after the season had finished.\n\nJessica Sanchez received the fewest votes during the Top 7 week, and the judges decided to use their \"save\" option on her, making her the first female recipient of the save. The following week, unlike previous seasons, Colton Dixon was the only contestant sent home. Sanchez later made the final two, the first season where a recipient of the save reached the finale.\n\nPhillips became the winner, beating Sanchez. Fifth season finalist Ace Young proposed marriage to third season runner-up Diana DeGarmo on stage – which she accepted.\n\nPhillips released \"Home\" as his coronation song, while Sanchez released \"Change Nothing\". Phillips' \"Home\" has since become the best selling of all coronation songs.\n\nThe twelfth season premiered on January 16, 2013. Judges Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler left the show after two seasons. This season's judging panel consisted of Randy Jackson, along with Mariah Carey, Keith Urban and Nicki Minaj. This was the first season since the ninth season to have four judges on the panel. The pre-season buzz and the early episodes of the show were dominated by the feud between the judges Minaj and Carey after a video of their dispute was leaked to TMZ.\n\nThe top 10 contestants started with five males and five females, however, the males were eliminated consecutively in the first five weeks, with Lazaro Arbos the last male to be eliminated. For the first time in the show's history, the top 5 contestants were all female. It was also the first time that the judges' \"save\" was not used, the top four contestants were therefore given an extra week to perform again with their votes carried over with no elimination in the first week.\n\n23-year-old Candice Glover won the season with Kree Harrison taking the runner-up spot. Glover is the first female to win \"American Idol\" since Jordin Sparks. Glover released \"I Am Beautiful\" as a single while Harrison released \"All Cried Out\" immediately after the show. Glover sold poorly with her debut album, and this is also the first season that the runner-up was not signed by a music label.\n\nTowards the end of the season, Randy Jackson, the last remaining of the original judges, would no longer serve as a judge to pursue other business ventures. Both judges Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj also decided to leave after one season to focus on their music careers.\n\nThe thirteenth season premiered on January 15, 2014. Randy Jackson and Keith Urban returned, though Jackson moved from the judging panel to the role of in-mentor. Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj left the panel after one season. Former judge Jennifer Lopez and former mentor Harry Connick, Jr. joined Urban on the panel. Also, Nigel Lythgoe and Ken Warwick were replaced as executive producers by Per Blankens, Jesse Ignjatovic and Evan Pragger. Bill DeRonde replaced Warwick as a director of the audition episodes, while Louis J. Horvitz replaced Gregg Gelfand as a director of the show.\n\nThis was the first season where the contestants were permitted to perform in the final rounds songs they wrote themselves. In the Top 8, Sam Woolf received the fewest votes, but he was saved from elimination by the judges. The 500th episode of the series was the Top 3 performance night.\n\nCaleb Johnson was named the winner of the season, with Jena Irene as the runner-up. Johnson released \"As Long as You Love Me\" as his coronation single while Irene released \"We Are One\".\n\nThe fourteenth season premiered on January 7, 2015. Jennifer Lopez, Keith Urban and Harry Connick, Jr. returned for their respective fourth, third and second seasons as judges. Eighth season runner-up Adam Lambert filled in for Urban during the New York City auditions. Randy Jackson did not return as the in-house mentor for this season. Scott Borchetta replaced Jackson as the mentor.\n\nChanges this season include only airing one episode a week during the final ten. Coca-Cola ended their longtime sponsorship of the show and Ford Motor Company maintained a reduced role. The winner of the season also received a recording contract with Big Machine Records.\n\nNick Fradiani won the season, defeating Clark Beckham. By winning, Fradiani became the first winner from the Northeast region. Fradiani released \"Beautiful Life\" as his coronation single while Beckham released \"Champion\". Jax, the third place finalist, also released a single called \"Forcefield\".\n\nFox announced on May 11, 2015 that the fifteenth season would be the final season of \"American Idol\"; as such, the season was expected to have an additional focus on the program's alumni. Ryan Seacrest returned as host, with Harry Connick Jr., Keith Urban, and Jennifer Lopez all returning as judges. The season was shortened by four weeks compared to previous years. During the finale episode, President Barack Obama praised the millions of young people that voted for contestants and pitched that they vote in the upcoming election. The farewell season concluded on April 7, 2016. Seacrest signed off by saying: \"And one more time—this is so tough—we say to you from Hollywood, goodnight America\", and then he added, \"for now.\"\n\nTrent Harmon won the season against runner-up La'Porsha Renae. Harmon released \"Falling\" co-written by Keith Urban as his coronation song. Renae's \"Battles\", third-place finisher Dalton Rapattoni's \"Strike A Match\" and fourth-place finisher MacKenzie Bourg's \"Roses\" were also released as singles.\n\nIn early 2017, \"Variety\" reported that Fremantle Media was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox. A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans. In May 2017, ABC was making a bid to revive the program. ABC acquired the rights to the series, and \"American Idol\" returned for the 2017–18 television season.\n\nKaty Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie were the three judges and Ryan Seacrest returned as host. The sixteenth season premiered on March 11, 2018. The season was again shortened compared to the previous season to twelve weeks, with multiple elimination in the final rounds. On May 21, 2018 the season concluded, crowning Maddie Poppe winner and Caleb Lee Hutchinson runner-up.\n\nABC renewed the revival series for another season. Perry, Bryan and Richie returned as judges, while Seacrest returned as host. The seventeenth season premiered on March 3, 2019. For the finale, the show no longer features separate performance and result shows. On May 19, 2019 the season concluded, crowning Laine Hardy winner and Alejandro Aranda runner-up. Hardy released a single, \"Flame\", immediately after the win, but Aranda did not. However, Aranda did announce he would release a new single and a new album in the near future.\n\nOn May 13, 2019, the series was renewed for an eighteenth season and will premiere on February 16, 2020. Ryan Seacrest will return as the host.\n\nSeasonal rankings (based on average total viewers per episode) of \"American Idol\". It holds the distinction of having the longest winning streak in the Nielsen annual television ratings; it became the highest-rated of all television programs in the United States overall for an unprecedented seven consecutive years, or eight consecutive (and total) years when either its performance or result show was ranked number one overall.\n\n\"American Idol\" premiered in June 2002 and became the surprise summer hit show of 2002. The first show drew 9.9 million viewers, giving Fox the best viewing figure for the 8.30 pm spot in over a year. The audience steadily grew, and by finale night, the audience had averaged 23 million, with more than 40 million watching some part of that show. That episode was placed third amongst all age groups, but more importantly it led in the 18–49 demographic, the age group most valued by advertisers.\n\nThe growth continued into the next season, starting with a season premiere of 26.5 million. The season attracted an average of 21.7 million viewers, and was placed second overall amongst the 18–49 age group. The finale night when Ruben Studdard won over Clay Aiken was also the highest-rated ever \"American Idol\" episode at 38.1 million for the final hour. By the third season, the show had become the top show in the 18–49 demographic<ref name=\"realitytvworld_5/24/2007\"></ref> a position it has held for all subsequent years up to and including the tenth season, and its competition stages ranked first in the nationwide overall ratings. By the fourth season, \"American Idol\" had become the most-watched series amongst all viewers on American TV for the first time, with an average viewership of 26.8 million. The show reached its peak in the fifth season with numbers averaging 30.6 million per episode, and this season remains the highest-rated of the series.\n\nThe sixth season premiered with the series' highest-rated debut episode and a few of its succeeding episodes rank among the most-watched episodes of \"American Idol.\" During this time, many television executives begun to regard the show as a programming force unlike any seen before, as its consistent dominance of up to two hours two or three nights a week exceeded the 30- or 60-minute reach of previous hits such as NBC's \"The Cosby Show\". The show was dubbed \"the Death Star\", and competing networks often rearranged their schedules in order to minimize losses. However, the sixth season also showed a steady decline in viewership over the course of the season. The season finale saw a drop in ratings of 16% from the previous year. The sixth season was the first season wherein the average results show rated higher than the competition stages (unlike in the previous seasons), and became the second-highest-rated of the series after the preceding season.\n\nThe loss of viewers continued into the seventh season. The premiere was down 11% among total viewers, and the results show in which Kristy Lee Cook was eliminated delivered its lowest-rated Wednesday show among the 18–34 demo since the first season in 2002. However, the ratings rebounded for the seventh-season finale with the excitement over the battle of the Davids, and improved over the sixth season as the series' third most watched finale. The strong finish of season seven also helped Fox become the most watched TV network in the country for the first time since its inception, a first ever in American television history for a non-Big Three major broadcast network. Overall ratings for the season were down 10% from the sixth season, which is in line with the fall in viewership across all networks due in part to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\nThe declining trend however continued into the eighth season, as total viewers numbers fell by 5–10% for early episodes compared to the seventh season, and by 9% for the finale. In the ninth season, \"Idol\" six-year extended streak of perfection in the ratings was broken, when NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics on February 17 beat \"Idol\" in the same time slot with 30.1 million viewers over \"Idol\"'s 18.4 million. Nevertheless, \"American Idol\" overall finished its ninth season as the most watched TV series for the sixth year running, breaking the previous record of five consecutive seasons achieved by CBS' \"All in the Family\" and NBC's \"The Cosby Show\".\n\nIn the tenth season, the total viewer numbers for the first week of shows fell 12–13%, and by up to 23% in the 18–49 demo compared to the ninth season. Later episodes, however, retained viewers better, and the season ended on a high with a significant increase in viewership for the finale – up 12% for the adults 18–49 demographic and a 21% increase in total viewers from the ninth season finale. While the overall viewer number has increased this season, its viewer demographics have continued to age year on year – the median age this season was 47.2 compared to a median age of 32.1 in its first season. The demographics also became \"whiter\" over time and less diverse. Nevertheless, in the 2010–11 television season, Fox maintained its lead on over other networks with its seventh consecutive season of victory overall in the 18–49 demographic ratings in the United States.\n\nThe eleventh season, however, suffered a steep drop in ratings, a drop attributed by some to the arrival of new shows such as \"The Voice\" and \"The X Factor\". The ratings for the first two episodes of the eleventh season fell 16–21% in overall viewer numbers and 24–27% in the 18/49 demo, while the season finale fell 27% in total viewer number and 30% in the 18–49 demo. The average viewership for the season fell below 20 million viewers the first time since 2003, a drop of 23% in total viewers and 30% in the 18/49 demo. For the first time in eight years, \"American Idol\" lost the leading position in both the total viewers number and the 18/49 demo, coming in second to \"NBC Sunday Night Football\", although the strengths of \"Idol\" in its second year in the Wednesday-Thursday primetime slots helped Fox achieve the longest period of 18–49 demographic victory in the Nielsen ratings, standing at 8 straight years from 2004 to 2012.\n\nThe loss of viewers continued into the twelfth season, which saw the show hitting a number of series low in the 18–49 demo. The finale had 7.2 million fewer viewers than the previous season, and saw a drop of 44% in the 18–49 demo. The season viewers averaged at 13.3 million, a drop of 24% from the previous season. The thirteenth season suffered a huge decline in the 18–49 demographic, a drop of 28% from the twelfth season, and \"American Idol\" lost its Top 10 position in the Nielsen ratings by the end of the 2013–14 television season for the first time since its entry to the rankings in 2003 as a result, and never regained its Top 10 position by the series' end in 2016.\n\nThe continuing decline influenced further changes for the fourteenth season, including the loss of Coca-Cola as the show's major sponsor, and a decision to only broadcast one, two-hour show per week during the top 12 rounds (with results from the previous week integrated into the performance show, rather than having a separate results show). On May 11, 2015, prior to the fourteenth-season finale, Fox announced that the fifteenth season of \"American Idol\" would be its last. Despite these changes, the show's ratings would decline more sharply. The fourteenth-season finale was the lowest-rated finale ever, with an average of only 8.03 million viewers watching the finale. The show's ratings, however, rebounded in its final season and ended its run in 2016 as Fox's first-ever program to conclude its run without dropping from the Nielsen Top 30 most-watched television shows in each of its seasons.\n\nFor the revived series on ABC, the ratings were lower but remained stable compared to previous seasons on Fox. The finale of the seventeenth season was slightly more watched than the sixteenth.\n\nEarly reviews were mixed in their assessment. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\" considered that \"As TV, \"American Idol\" is crazily entertaining; as music, it's dust-mote inconsequential\". Others, however, thought that \"the most striking aspect of the series was the genuine talent it revealed\". It was also described as a \"sadistic musical bake-off\", and \"a romp in humiliation\". Other aspects of the show have attracted criticisms. The product placement in the show in particular was noted, and some critics were harsh about what they perceived as its blatant commercial calculations – Karla Peterson of \"The San Diego Union-Tribune\" charged that \"American Idol\" is \"a conniving multimedia monster\" that has \"absorbed the sin of our debauched culture and spit them out in a lump of reconstituted evil\". The decision to send the first season winner to sing the national anthem at the Lincoln Memorial on the first anniversary of the September 11 attacks in 2002 was also poorly received by many. Lisa de Moraes of \"The Washington Post\" noted sarcastically that \"The terrorists have won\" and, with a sideswipe at the show's commercialism and voting process, that the decision as to who \"gets to turn this important site into just another cog in the 'Great \"American Idol\" Marketing Mandala' is in the hands of the millions of girls who have made \"American Idol\" a hit. Them and a handful of phone-redialer geeks who have been clocking up to 10,000 calls each week for their contestant of choice (but who, according to Fox, are in absolutely no way skewing the outcome).\"\n\nSome of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of \"Entertainment Weekly\", thought that \"for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, \"Idol\" provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\" Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\". Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\" Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of \"Newsweek\" accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\" Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on \"Idol\" are not real artists with self-respect.\n\nSome in the entertainment industry were critical of the star-making aspect of the show. Usher, a mentor on the show, bemoaning the loss of the \"true art form of music\", thought that shows like \"American Idol\" made it seem \"so easy that everyone can do it, and that it can happen overnight\", and that \"television is a lie\". Musician Michael Feinstein, while acknowledging that the show had uncovered promising performers, said that \"American Idol\" \"isn't really about music. It's about all the bad aspects of the music business – the arrogance of commerce, this sense of 'I know what will make this person a star; artists themselves don't know.' \" That \"American Idol\" is seen to be a fast track to success for its contestants has been a cause of resentment for some in the industry. LeAnn Rimes, commenting on Carrie Underwood winning Best Female Artist in Country Music Awards over Faith Hill in 2006, said that \"Carrie has not paid her dues long enough to fully deserve that award\". It is a common theme that has been echoed by many others. Elton John, who had appeared as a mentor in the show but turned down an offer to be a judge on \"American Idol\", commenting on talent shows in general, said that \"there have been some good acts but the only way to sustain a career is to pay your dues in small clubs\". \"American Idol\" revolutionized American pop culture and the pop idol process and has provided an opportunity for many to bypass the small club scene and allow a much larger audience to participate in and select the next potential chart topping performer.\n\nThe success of the show's alumni, however, has led to a more positive assessment of the show, and the show was described as having \"proven it has a valid way to pick talent and a proven way to sell records\". While the industry is divided on the show success, its impact is felt particularly strongly in the country music format. According to a CMT exec, reflecting on the success of Idol alumni in the country genre, \"if you want to try and get famous fast by going to a cattle call audition on TV, Idol reasonably remains the first choice for anyone\", and that country music and Idol \"go together well\".\n\n\"American Idol\" was nominated for the Emmy's Outstanding Reality Competition Program for nine years but never won. Director Bruce Gower won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing For A Variety, Music Or Comedy Series in 2009, and the show won a Creative Arts Emmys each in 2007 and 2008, three in 2009, and two in 2011, as well as a Governor's Award in 2007 for its Idol Gives Back edition. It won the People's Choice Award, which honors the popular culture of the previous year as voted by the public, for favorite competition/reality show in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2010, 2011 and 2012. It won the first Critics' Choice Television Award in 2011 for Best Reality Competition.\n\nIn 2013, TV Guide ranked the series No. 48 on its list of the 60 Best Series of All Time.\n\nThroughout the series, twelve of the seventeen \"Idol\" winners, including its first five, had come from the Southern United States. A large number of other finalists during the series' run have also hailed from the American South, including Clay Aiken, Kellie Pickler, and Chris Daughtry, who are all from North Carolina. In 2012, an analysis of the 131 contestants who have appeared in the finals of all seasons of the show up to that point found that 48% have some connection to the Southern United States.\n\nThe show itself was popular in the Southern United States, with households in the Southeastern United States 10% more likely to watch \"American Idol\" during the eighth season in 2009, and those in the East Central region, such as Kentucky, were 16 percent more likely to tune into the series. Data from Nielsen SoundScan, a music-sales tracking service, showed that of the 47 million CDs sold by \"Idol\" contestants through January 2010, 85 percent were by contestants with ties to the American South.\n\nTheories given for the success of Southerners on \"Idol\" have been: more versatility with musical genres, as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households; and the strong heritage of music and singing, which is notable in the Bible Belt, where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing. Others also suggest that the Southern character of these contestants appeal to the South, as well as local pride. According to fifth season winner Taylor Hicks, who is from the state of Alabama, \"People in the South have a lot of pride ... So, they're adamant about supporting the contestants who do well from their state or region.\"\n\nFor five consecutive seasons, starting in the seventh season, the title was given to a white male who plays the guitar – a trend that \"Idol\" pundits call the \"White guy with guitar\" or \"WGWG\" factor. Just hours before the eleventh-season finale, where Phillip Phillips was named the winner, Richard Rushfield, author of the book \"American Idol: The Untold Story\", said, \"You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as ... who's the nicest guy in a popularity contest\", he says, \"And that has led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.\"\n\nThe show was criticized in earlier seasons over the onerous contract contestants had to sign that gave excessive control to 19 Entertainment over their future careers, and handed a large part of their future earnings to the management.\n\nIndividual contestants have generated controversy in this competition for their past actions, or for being 'ringers' planted by the producers. A number of contestants have been disqualified for various reasons, such as for having an existing contract or undisclosed criminal record, although the show has also been accused of a double standard for disqualifying some but not others.\n\nVoting results have been a consistent source of controversy. The mechanism of voting has aroused considerable criticism, most notably in the second season when Ruben Studdard beat Clay Aiken in a close vote, and in the eighth season, when the massive increase in text votes fueled the texting controversy. Concerns about power voting have been expressed from the very first season. Since 2004, votes also have been affected to a limited degree by online communities such as DialIdol, and Vote for the Worst.\n\nThe enormous success of the show and the revenue it generated were transformative for the Fox Broadcasting Company. \"American Idol\" and other shows such as \"Survivor\" and \"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\" were credited for expanding reality television programming in the United States in the 1990s and 2000s, and \"Idol\" became the most watched non-scripted primetime television series, which it remained for almost a decade, from 2003 to 2012, breaking records on U.S. television (dominated by drama shows and sitcoms in the preceding decades).\n\nThe show pushed Fox to become the number one U.S. TV network among adults aged 18–49, the key demographic coveted by advertisers, for an unprecedented eight consecutive years by 2012. Its success also helped lift the ratings of other shows that were scheduled around it such as \"House\" and \"Bones\", and \"Idol\", for years, was Fox's strongest platform primetime television program for promoting eventual hit shows of the 2010s (of the same network) such as \"Glee\" and \"New Girl\". The show, its creator Simon Fuller claimed, \"saved Fox\".\n\nThe show's massive success in the mid-2000s to early 2010s spawned a number of imitating singing-competition shows, such as \"Rock Star\", \"Nashville Star\", \"The Voice\", \"Rising Star\", \"The Sing-Off\", and \"The X Factor\". The number of imitative singing shows on American television had reached 17 by its final year in 2016. Its format also served as a blueprint for non-singing TV shows such as \"Dancing with the Stars\" and \"So You Think You Can Dance\", most of which contribute to the current highly competitive reality TV landscape on American television.\n\nAs one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, \"American Idol\" has had a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment. It helped create a number of highly successful recording artists, such as Kelly Clarkson, Daughtry and Carrie Underwood, as well as others of varying notability. The alumni of the show had received between them 54 Grammy nominations and 13 Grammy awards by the end of the show in 2016, with Carrie Underwood winning seven.\n\nVarious \"American Idol\" alumni had success on various record charts around the world; in the U.S. they had achieved 345 number ones on the \"Billboard\" charts in its first 10 years, and 458 by its last year of broadcast in 2016, with 100 achieved by Kelly Clarkson alone. According to Fred Bronson, author of books on the Billboard charts, no other entity has ever created as many hit-making artists and best-selling albums and singles. In 2007, \"American Idol\" alums accounted for 2.1% of all music sales. Its alumni have a massive impact on radio; in 2007, \"American Idol\" had become \"a dominant force in radio\" according to the president of the research company Mediabase which monitors radio stations Rich Meyer. By 2010, four winners each had more than a million radio spins, with Kelly Clarkson leading the field with over four million spins.\n\nAt the end of the show's run, Idol's contestants have sold more than 60 million albums in the US, resulting in more than 80 Platinum records and 95 Gold records. Its participants have generated more than 450 Billboard No. 1 hits and sold more than 260 million digital downloads.\n\nThe impact of \"American Idol\" was also strongly felt in musical theatre, where many of \"Idol\" alumni have forged successful careers. The striking effect of former \"American Idol\" contestants on Broadway has been noted and commented on. The casting of a popular \"Idol\" contestant can lead to significantly increased ticket sales. Other alumni have gone on to work in television and films, the most notable being Jennifer Hudson who, on the recommendation of the \"Idol\" vocal coach Debra Byrd, won a role in \"Dreamgirls\" and subsequently received an Academy Award for her performance.\n\nThe dominance of \"American Idol\" in the ratings had made it the most profitable show in U.S. TV for many years. The show was estimated to generate $900 million for the year 2004 through sales of TV ads, albums, merchandise and concert tickets. By the seventh season, the show was estimated to earn around $900 million from its ad revenue alone, not including ancillary sponsorship deals and other income. One estimate puts the total TV revenue for the first eight seasons of American at $6.4 billion. Sponsors that bought fully integrated packages can expect a variety of promotions of their products on the show, such as product placement, adverts and product promotion integrated into the show, and various promotional opportunities. Other off-air promotional partners pay for the rights to feature \"Idol\" branding on their packaging, products and marketing programs. \"American Idol\" also partnered with Disney in its theme park attraction The American Idol Experience.\n\n\"American Idol\" became the most expensive series on broadcast networks for advertisers starting the fourth season, and by the next season, it had broken the record in advertising rate for a regularly scheduled prime-time network series, selling over $700,000 for a 30-seconds slot, and reaching up to $1.3 million for the finale. Its ad prices reached a peak in the seventh season at $737,000. Estimated revenue more than doubled from $404 million in the third season to $870 million in the sixth season. While that declined from the eighth season onwards, it still earned significantly more than its nearest competitor, with advertising revenue topping $800 million annually the next few seasons. However, the sharp drop in ratings in the eleventh season also resulted in a sharp drop in advertising rate for the twelfth season, and the show lost its leading position as the costliest show for advertisers. By 2014, ad revenue from had fallen to $427 million where a 30-second spot went for less than $300,000. For the relaunched \"Idol\" on ABC, it has been reported that a 30-second spot may cost between $120,000–$160,000.\n\nFord Motor Company and Coca-Cola were two of the first sponsors of \"American Idol\" in its first season. The sponsorship deal cost around $10 million in the first season, rising to $35 million by the seventh season, and between $50 to $60 million in the tenth season. The third major sponsor AT&T Wireless joined in the second season but ended after the twelfth season, and Coca-Cola officially ended its sponsorship after the thirteenth season amidst the declining ratings of \"Idol\" in the mid-2010s. iTunes sponsored the show since the seventh season.\n\n\"American Idol\" prominent display of its sponsors' logo and products had been noted since the early seasons. By the sixth season, \"Idol\" showed 4,349 product placements according to Nielsen Media Research. The branded entertainment integration proved beneficial to its advertisers – promotion of AT&T text-messaging as a means to vote successfully introduced the technology into the wider culture, and Coca-Cola has seen its equity increased during the show.\n\nCoca-Cola's archrival PepsiCo declined to sponsor \"American Idol\" at the show's start. What the \"Los Angeles Times\" later called \"missing one of the biggest marketing opportunities in a generation\" contributed to Pepsi losing market share, by 2010 falling to third place from second in the United States. PepsiCo sponsored the American version of Cowell's \"The X Factor\" in hopes of not repeating its \"Idol\" mistake until its cancellation.\n\nFor the revived series on ABC, Macy's and Johnson & Johnson's Zyrtec signed on as the major sponsors of the show.\n\nThe top ten (eleven in the tenth season, five in the fourteenth season, and seven in the sixteenth season) toured at the end of every season except for the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons. In the twelfth season tour a semi-finalist who won a sing-off was also added to the tour. Kellogg's Pop-Tarts was the sponsor for the first seven seasons, and Guitar Hero was added for the seventh season tour. M&M's Pretzel Chocolate Candies was a sponsor of the ninth season tour. The fifth season tour was the most successful tour with gross of over $35 million. However no concert tour was organized in the fifteenth and seventeenth seasons, the only seasons not to have an associated tour. The sixteenth season tour featured the band In Real Life as an opener on select dates.\n\n\"Idol Gives Back\" was a special charity event started in season six featuring performances by celebrities and various fund-raising initiatives. This event was also held in seasons seven and nine and has raised nearly $185 million in total.\n\n\"American Idol\" has traditionally released studio recordings of contestants' performances as well as the winner's coronation single for sale. For the first five seasons, the recordings were released as a compilation album at the end of the season. All five of these albums reached the top ten in Billboard 200 which made then \"American Idol\" the most successful soundtrack franchise of any motion picture or television program. Starting late in the fifth season, individual performances were released during the season as digital downloads, initially from the \"American Idol\" official website only. In the seventh season the live performances and studio recordings were made available during the season from iTunes when it joined as a sponsor. In the tenth season the weekly studio recordings were also released as compilation digital album straight after performance night.\n\n19 Recordings, a recording label owned by 19 Entertainment, currently hold the rights to phonographic material recorded by all the contestants. 19 originally partnered with Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG) to promote and distribute the recordings through its labels RCA Records, Arista Records, J Records, Jive Records. In 2005–2007, BMG partnered with Sony Music Entertainment to form a joint venture known as Sony BMG Music Entertainment. From 2008 to 2010, Sony Music handled the distribution following their acquisition of BMG. Sony Music was partnered with \"American Idol\" and distribute its music, and In 2010, Sony was replaced by as the music label for \"American Idol\" by UMG's Interscope-Geffen-A&M Records.\n\n\"American Idol\" video games\n\nOn February 14, 2009, The Walt Disney Company debuted \"The American Idol Experience\" at its Disney's Hollywood Studios theme park at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. In this live production, co-produced by 19 Entertainment, park guests chose from a list of songs and auditioned privately for Disney cast members. Those selected then performed on a stage in a 1000-seat theater replicating the \"Idol\" set. Three judges, whose mannerisms and style mimicked those of the real \"Idol\" judges, critiqued the performances. Audience members then voted for their favorite performer. There were several preliminary-round shows during the day that culminated in a \"finals\" show in the evening where one of the winners of the previous rounds that day was selected as the overall winner. The winner of the finals show received a \"Dream Ticket\" that granted them front-of-the-line privileges at any future \"American Idol\" audition. The attraction closed on August 30, 2014.\n\"American Idol\" is broadcast to over 100 nations worldwide. In most nations these are not live broadcasts and may be tape delayed by several days or weeks, except for other season finales that are aired live in several countries simulcast with the U.S. broadcast on Fox (2002–2016) and ABC (since 2018). In Canada, the first thirteen seasons of American Idol were aired live countrywide by CTV and/or CTV Two, in simulcast with Fox. CTV dropped \"Idol\" after its thirteenth season and in August 2014, Yes TV announced that it had picked up Canadian rights to \"American Idol\" beginning in its 2015 season. In 2017, it was announced the show would return to CTV Two for its sixteenth season.\n\nIn Latin America, the show is broadcast and subtitled by Sony Entertainment Television. In Southeast Asia, it is broadcast by Sony Channel every Monday and Tuesday nine or ten hours after since its revival. In Philippines, it is aired every Thursday and Friday nine or ten hours after its United States telecast; from 2004 to 2007 on ABC 5; 2008–11 on QTV, then GMA News TV; and since 2012 on ETC. In Australia, it aired a few hours after the U.S. telecast. It was aired on Network Ten from 2002 to 2008 and then again in 2013. Between 2008 and 2012 it aired on Fox8 and the thirteenth and fourteenth seasons (2014–15) it aired on digital channel, Eleven, a sister channel to Network Ten. Its final season (2016) aired on Fox8 hours after the original U.S. broadcast. The show enjoyed a lot of popularity in Australia throughout the 2000s before declining in the ratings. In the United Kingdom, episodes were aired one day after the U.S. broadcast on digital channel ITV2. In the twelfth season, the episodes aired on 5*. It was also aired in Ireland on TV3 two days after the telecast. In Brazil and Israel, the show airs two days after its original broadcast, and broadcast live during the season finale. In the instances where the airing is delayed, the shows may sometimes be combined into one episode to summarize the results. In Italy, the twelfth season was broadcast by La3. In Singapore, The show was broadcast on Mediacorp Channel 5 for the ninth and tenth seasons.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "37613", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=37613", "title": "BBC World News", "text": "BBC World News\n\nBBC World News is an international pay television channel that is operated by BBC. The BBC is a public corporation of the UK government's Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. It has the largest audience of any channel, with an estimated 121 million viewers weekly in 2016/2017, part of the estimated 372 million weekly audience of the BBC's four main international news services. Launched on 11 March 1991 as \"BBC World Service Television\" outside Europe, its name was changed to \"BBC World\" on 16 January 1995 and to \"BBC World News\" on 21 April 2008. It broadcasts news bulletins, documentaries, lifestyle programmes and interview shows. Unlike the BBC's domestic channels, BBC World News is owned and operated by BBC Global News Ltd., part of the BBC's commercial group of companies, and is funded by subscription and advertising revenues, and not by the United Kingdom television licence. It is not owned by BBC Studios. The service is aimed at the overseas market, similar to CNN International, Al Jazeera English, CGTN, NHK World, DD India, DW, France 24 and RT.\n\nThe channel originally started as BBC World Service Television and was a commercial operation. The British government refused to fund to the new television service using grant-in-aid. (BBC World Service radio was funded by a grant-in-aid from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office until 2014.) The channel started broadcasting on 11 March 1991, after two weeks of real-time pilots, initially as a half-hour bulletin once a day at 19:00 GMT.\n\nIn 1995, BBC World Service Television was split into two services:\n\nBBC World's on-air design was changed significantly on 3 April 2000, bringing it closer to the look of its sister channel in the UK which was then known as BBC News 24, the on-air look of which had been redesigned in 1999. The look of both channels was made up of red and cream and designed by Lambie-Nairn, with music based on a style described as 'drums and beeps' composed by David Lowe, a departure from the general orchestral nature of music used by other news programmes.\n\nOn 8 December 2003 a second makeover, using the same 'drums and beeps' style music but new graphics took place, although on a much smaller scale to that of 2000. The music was changed slightly while the main colour scheme became black and red, with studios using frosted glass and white and red colours. Later in 2004, the channel's slogan became \"Putting News First\", replacing \"Demand a Broader View\".\n\nThe channel's present name \"BBC World News\" was introduced on 21 April 2008 as part of a £550,000 rebranding of the BBC's overall news output and visual identity. BBC World News later moved to the renovated studio vacated by BBC News 24 (now the BBC News Channel). New graphics were produced by the Lambie-Nairn design agency and music reworked by David Lowe.\n\nBBC World News relocated to Broadcasting House from its previous home at Television Centre on 14 January 2013. This was part of the move of BBC News and other audio and vision departments of the BBC into one building in Central London. Broadcasting House was refurbished at a cost of £1 billion. A new newsroom and several state-of-the-art studios were built.\n\nLive news output originates from studios B and C in Broadcasting House with some recorded programming from Broadcasting House studio A and the BBC Millbank studio. The BBC World News newsroom is now part of the new consolidated BBC Newsroom in Broadcasting House along with BBC World Service and UK domestic news services.\n\nPreviously, the channel was broadcast in 4:3, with the news output fitted into a frame for both digital and analogue broadcasting, resulting in black bands at the top and bottom of the screen. On 13 January 2009 at 09:57 GMT, BBC World News switched its broadcast to format, initially in Europe on Astra 1L satellite, and Eutelsat Hot Bird 6 satellite to other broadcast feeds in the Asian region from 20 January 2009. The channel ceased broadcasting on analogue satellite on 18 April 2006.\n\nAs a result of the move to Broadcasting House, BBC World News gained high-definition studios and equipment to be able to broadcast in high-definition. On 5 August 2013, BBC World News was offered as a High Definition (HD) feed across the Middle East when it launched its international HD channel on Arabsat. Arabsat was the BBC's first distribution partner in the Middle East to offer the channel in HD. On 1 April 2015 BBC World News in English started broadcasting in high definition from the 11.229 GHz/V transponder on Astra 1KR at the 19.2°E orbital position, available free-to-air to viewers with 60 cm dishes across Europe and coastal North Africa.\n\nBBC World News claims to be watched by a weekly audience of 74 million in over 200 countries and territories worldwide. BBC World News is most commonly watched as a free-to-air (FTA) channel. The channel is available in Europe and many parts of the world via satellite (FTA) or cable platforms.\n\nIn the United States, the channel is available through providers such as Cablevision, Comcast, Spectrum, Verizon FiOS, and AT&T U-verse. As of 2014, US distribution and advertising sales for the channel are handled by AMC Networks, who are the minority partner for the BBC's entertainment channel BBC America.\n\nIn addition, BBC World News syndicates its daytime and evening news programmes to public television stations throughout the US, originally maintaining a distribution partnership with Garden City, New York-based WLIW that lasted from 1998 until October 2008, when the BBC and WLIW mutually decided not to renew the contract. BBC World News subsequently entered into an agreement with Community Television of Southern California, Inc., in which Los Angeles PBS member station KCET (which was a public independent station from 2011 to 2018) would take over distribution rights to \"BBC World News America\" (the KCET agreement has since been extended to encompass a half-hour simulcast of the 90-minute-long midday news bulletin \"GMT\", which airs in the US as a morning show, and a weekly edition of the BBC newsmagazine \"Newsnight\"). Since June 2019, broadcasting of BBC news programming is handled by WETA-TV. PBS separately began distributing another program aired by the channel, \"Beyond 100 Days\", as a tape-delayed late night broadcast on 2 January 2018, as an interim replacement for \"Charlie Rose\". Unlike \"GMT\" and \"BBC World News America\", \"Beyond 100 Days\" is distributed exclusively to PBS member stations as part of the service's base schedule.\n\nBBC World News began streaming its content on YouTube on 16 July 2017. The channel is available in the US as part of Sling's World News add-on package.\n\nFrom 2012 until it closed in 2016, BBC World News was available on LiveStation.\n\nTV platforms in the UK (i.e. Freeview, Sky, BT TV, Freesat, Virgin) do not officially offer BBC World News as a standalone full-time channel because it carries and is funded by advertising (BBC's domestic channels are funded by a television licence fee which households and establishments that want to watch television programmes as they are being broadcast must pay), although it can be easily received due to its 'free-to-air' status on many European satellite systems, including Astra and Hot Bird and is available in selected London hotels. BBC World News can also be viewed in the public areas of Broadcasting House (the lobby and café).\n\nHowever, some BBC World News programmes are officially available to UK audiences. Such programmes air on the BBC's domestic channels and some are available on-demand on the BBC's iPlayer. From 00.00 to 05.00 UK time, the top-of-the-hour news bulletins on BBC World News are simulcast on the BBC News Channel. At 01.30 weekdays, \"Asia Business Report\" and \"Sport Today\" also air on both channels. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of \"The Briefing\" and \"Business Briefing\" on BBC One and the BBC News channel. This programme was previously branded as 'The World Today' (later a generic BBC World News bulletin) and \"World Business Report\" respectively. At 08.30 UK time, \"Worklife\" airs on the BBC News Channel. BBC World News also produces a version of \"Outside Source\" at 21:00 UK time Monday-Thursday (seen on the BBC News Channel), \"World News Today\" at 19:00 Monday-Friday (seen on BBC Four), and 21:00 Friday-Sunday (seen on the BBC News Channel). \"World News Today\" replaced \"The World\", which had been broadcast as a simulcast on BBC Four between 2002 and 2007.\n\nBoth World and the BBC News Channel have also occasionally had to simulcast the same news programme due to strike action or technical issues; this occurred in 2003 when Television Centre in London was affected by electrical problems.\n\nLive news programmes:\n\nLive business and sport programmes:\n\nPre-recorded programmes:\n\nHalf-hour \"BBC World News\" bulletins are made available to Public Broadcasting Service stations in the US through Los Angeles' KCET, a non-commercial independent public television station which has been separate from PBS since the beginning of 2011 due to a rights fee dispute. 80 to 90% of Americans are able to receive the bulletins, though broadcast times vary between different localities. The programme is broadcast on several PBS stations in markets such as New York City and Washington DC.\n\nOn PBS stations, \"BBC World News\" is not broadcast with traditional commercials (the breaks are filled with news stories) but omits the Met Office international weather forecast at the end of the programme, replacing it with underwriting announcements. The PBS broadcasts are tape-delayed on some stations.\n\nBBC America were aired a three-hour block of BBC World News programmes from 05:00 to 08:00 on weekdays. Met Office forecasts are removed, and it is broadcast with advertisements.\n\nMany airlines from across the world also play pre-recorded extracts of the BBC World News, have text headlines from it or have a full bulletin available on the in-flight entertainment systems.\n\nAnother BBC World News programme, the hour-long \"BBC World News America\", aired on BBC America at 19:00 Eastern Time. A second broadcast at 22:00 Eastern Time ended in 2010 when BBC America introduced a second feed for the western time zones of the US on 18 February 2011, it was announced that \"BBC World News America\" would no longer be broadcast on BBC America and would instead be broadcast only on BBC World and local PBS stations in the US as a 30-minute program.\n\nThe channel also produced short bulletins for public transport services in Singapore and Hong Kong:\n\nThese broadcasts began with the statement: \"Welcome to BBC World News on board the Singapore Mass Rapid Transit and Hong Kong Mass Transit Railway\". The short bulletin was updated twice a day, and has since been replaced by a similar programme from MediaCorp's Channel NewsAsia.\n\nTravellers on the Heathrow Express rail service between London Paddington and London Heathrow Airport could watch a summary of the headlines from BBC World News on the LCD screens provided.\n\nBBC World News is, for the most part, the same channel all over the world; the commercials are intended to be the only differences. However, there are some regional programming variations. For example, a number of programmes are made exclusively for regional viewings, such as Indian feeds, and \"The Record Europe\", which is only broadcast in Europe. Also, the weather forecasts focus more on the area the viewer is watching from.\n\nOn most feeds of BBC World News, when there are no commercials being inserted by the cable or satellite provider similar to other channels, the break filler shows promotions for upcoming programmes on the channel. During BBC News, a news story that has not been promoted airs during what would be the commercial break. This is the case on the broadband versions of BBC World News, and on versions of BBC World News aired in the US on Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) stations. However, there are some global commercials and sponsorships which air throughout the network.\n\nOn 11 September 2007, the break filler was redesigned and now more closely resembles previous versions. The promotional videos now fill the entire screen and are interspersed with news and market updates, schedules, and other information. There is also no longer a unifying music composition. Instead, each 20-second promotional video uses music selected from a handful of themes, which have some unifying musical characteristics. The information screens, such as the 10-second plug for the website or YouTube channel, and the 15-second weather/time/coming up screens each feature their own theme. The colour theme was updated following the relaunch of the channel in April 2008.\n\nSince its inception, and more so since its extensive association with the BBC News channel, the countdown to the hourly news bulletin has been a feature of the channel's presentation, accompanied by music composed by David Lowe. The current style of countdown features reporters and technical staff in many different locations working to bring news stories to air. The countdown can range from 45 seconds to as little as 3 seconds.\n\nBBC World News was named \"Best International News Channel\" at the Association for International Broadcasting Awards in November 2006. It won a Peabody Award in 2007 for \"White Horse Village\" and another in 2009 for \"Where Giving Life is a Death Sentence.\"\n"}
{"id": "77808", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=77808", "title": "Disney Channel", "text": "Disney Channel\n\nDisney Channel (originally called The Disney Channel from 1983 to 1997 and commonly shortened to Disney from 1997 to 2002) is an American pay television channel that serves as the flagship property of owner Disney Channels Worldwide unit of the Walt Disney Television subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company.\n\nDisney Channel's programming consists of original first-run television series, theatrically released and original made-for-TV movies and select other third-party programming. Disney Channel – which formerly operated as a premium service – originally marketed its programs towards families during the 1980s, and later at younger children by the 2000s. A majority of Disney Channel's original programming is aimed at children aged 6–16, while its Disney Junior programs are targeted at children aged 7 years and under.\n\nAs of January 2016, Disney Channel is available to approximately 93.9 million pay television households (80.6% of households with at least one television set) in the United States.\n\nIn 1977, Walt Disney Productions executive Jim Jimirro brought forth the idea of a cable television network that would feature television and film content sourced from the studio. Disney chairman Card Walker turned down the proposal, citing the company's focus on developing the Epcot Center at Walt Disney World. The idea was revived in November 1981, when Disney entered into a partnership with Group W Satellite Communications. In September 1982, Group W rescinded its interest in the intended joint venture, due to disagreements over creative control of the channel and financial obligations that would have had Group W shoulder 50% of the service's start-up costs. Walt Disney Productions continued on with the channel's development with help from the channel's founding president Alan Wagner, and formally announced the launch of its family-oriented cable channel in early 1983.\n\nThe Disney Channel launched nationally as a premium channel at 7:00 a.m. Eastern Time on April 18, 1983. The channel – which initially maintained a 16-hour-per-day programming schedule from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific Time – would become available on cable providers in all 50 U.S. states by September 1983, and accrue a base of more than 611,000 subscribers by December of that year.; In October 1983, the channel debuted its first made-for-cable movie, \"Tiger Town\", which earned the channel a CableACE Award. The channel had reached profitability by January 1985, with its programming reaching 1.75 million subscribers by that point.\n\nIn September 1990, TCI's Montgomery, Alabama, system became the first cable provider to carry the channel as a basic cable service. Between 1991 and 1996, a steadily increasing number of cable providers began shifting The Disney Channel from a premium add-on offering to their basic tiers, either experimentally or on a full-time basis; however, Walt Disney Company executives denied any plans to convert the channel into an ad-supported basic service, stating that the premium-to-basic shifts on some providers was part of a five-year \"hybrid\" strategy that allowed providers to offer the channel in either manner.\n\nOn April 6, 1997, the channel – which was officially renamed as simply Disney Channel and, until September 2002, alternatively identified only as \"Disney\" in on-air promotions and network identifications – underwent a significant rebranding and introducing a new logo styled as a Mickey ear-shaped TV set designed by Lee Hunt Associates. Programming-wise, it maintained a programming format similar to that which it carried as a full-fledged premium service; however, Disney Channel's target audience began shifting more toward a focus on kids, while continuing to cater to family audiences at night. Disney Channel also began to air break interruptions within shows to promote its programming and Disney film and home video releases, decreased the number of older films that aired on its schedule, and began catering its music programming more towards acts popular with pre-teens and teenagers (incorporating music videos and refocusing its concert specials to feature younger and up-and-coming musicians popular with that demographic). On August 23, 1997, the channel relaunched its slate of made-for-television movies – Disney Channel Original Movies – with \"Northern Lights\", supplanting the previous Disney Channel Premiere Films banner. Disney Channel also started to increase its original programming development, launching with the 1997 debut of the sitcom \"Flash Forward\".\n\nThe channel would eventually split its programming into three distinct blocks: Playhouse Disney (which debuted in May 1997, focusing on series aimed at preschoolers), Vault Disney (which began as a Sunday-only nighttime block in September 1997 before expanding to seven nights a week by late 1998, featuring older Disney programs, older television specials and some of the older feature films shifted off its daytime and prime time lineup), and Zoog Disney (a weekend afternoon and evening lineup hosted by anthropomorphic robot/alien hybrid characters called \"Zoogs\" that was introduced in August 1998, compromising original and acquired series aimed at preteens and teens). The Zoog Disney brand would later expand to encompass most of the channel's weekend daytime and evening schedule under the \"Zoog Weekendz\" banner in June 2000.\n\nIn 1999, Disney Channel began mandating that TV providers which continued to offer it as a premium service shift the channel to their basic channel tiers or else it would decline to renew carriage agreements with providers (such as Time Warner Cable and Comcast, the last major TV providers to carry the channel as a pay service) that chose to continue offering it as an add-on to their service. In the fall of 2002, Disney Channel discontinued the Zoog Weekendz and Vault Disney blocks – phasing out the \"Zoog\" brand on-air, and replacing the latter block with a lineup of same-day repeats of the channel's original and acquired programming – and reduced its nightly prime time movie lineup from showcasing an average of two to three features to a single feature daily. Its original programming slate also became heavily reliant on live-action sitcoms and animated series, eschewing reality series and scripted dramas.\n\nThe channel's original programming efforts of the 2000s also led to a marketing effort to cross over the stars of its series into music through record deals with sister music label Hollywood Records, beginning with Hilary Duff, who became the channel's first teen idol through the 2001–04 sitcom \"Lizzie McGuire\". The success of the 2003 original television film \"The Cheetah Girls\" led to other music-themed original programs being developed, including the 2006 hit original movie \"High School Musical\" and sitcom \"Hannah Montana\" (which launched the career of its star Miley Cyrus). The August 17, 2007 premiere of \"High School Musical 2\" became the highest-rated non-sports program in the history of basic-tier TV and the highest-rated made-for-cable movie premiere on record (as well as the highest-rated television program – either free-to-air or subscription-based– of Summer 2007) with 17.2 million viewers. In 2012, Disney Channel ended Nickelodeon's 17-year run as the highest-rated cable channel in the United States, placing its first ever win in total-day viewership among all cable networks as measured by ACNielsen.\n\n\"High School Musical 2\" is currently the most successful DCOM in terms of popularity and accolades, setting a basic cable record for the single most-watched television program, as its August 2007 debut was watched by 17.2 million viewers(counting sports, this record stood until a December 3, 2007 telecast of a New England Patriots-Baltimore Ravens game on corporate sibling ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\", which was watched by 17.5 million viewers). \"The Cheetah Girls\" films were also notably successful in terms of merchandise and sales for its concert tour and soundtrack albums. The first film in 2003 was the first made-for-TV movie musical in Disney Channel's history, and had a worldwide audience of over 84 million viewers. The second movie was the most successful of the series, bringing in 8.1 million viewers in the U.S. An 86-date concert tour featuring the group was ranked as one of the top 10 concert tours of 2006; the tour broke a record at the Houston Rodeo that was set by Elvis Presley in 1973, selling out with 73,500 tickets sold in three minutes.\n\nIn addition to its made-for-cable films, Disney Channel has rights to theatrically released feature films, with some film rights shared with sister network Freeform. Along with films released by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures (mainly consisting of releases from Walt Disney Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar), the channel also maintains rights to films from other studios. Some films released by Bagdasarian Productions (such as \"The Chipmunk Adventure\" and \"Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet Frankenstein\") have also aired on Disney Channel, although most of them are not presently owned by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.\n\n\n\nOn May 26, 2010, Disney-ABC Television Group announced the launch of a new digital cable and satellite channel targeted at children aged 2-7 called Disney Junior, which debuted on March 23, 2012. The Disney Junior channel – which like Disney Channel (though unlike Disney XD or the channel Disney Junior replaced, Soapnet), is commercial-free – competes with other preschooler-skewing cable channels such as Nick Jr., Qubo and Sprout. The channel features programs from Disney Channel's existing preschool programming library and movies from the Walt Disney Pictures film library. Disney Junior took over the channel space held by Soapnet – a Disney-owned cable channel featuring soap operas – due to that genre's decline in popularity on broadcast television, and the growth of video on demand, online streaming and digital video recorders, negating the need for a linear channel devoted to the soap opera genre. An automated Soapnet feed continued to exist for providers that had not yet made carriage agreements for Disney Junior (such as Dish Network) and those that have kept Soapnet as part of their lineups while adding Disney Junior as an additional channel (such as DirecTV and Cox Communications); After a period during which cable providers unwilling to drop the network immediately retained it to prevent subscriber cancellations, Soapnet ceased full operations on December 31, 2013.\n\nThe former Playhouse Disney block on Disney Channel was rebranded as Disney Junior on February 14, 2011; the 22 existing Playhouse Disney-branded cable channels and program blocks outside the United States rebranded under the Disney Junior name over the next two years, concluding with the rebranding of the Russian and Chinese versions in September 2013. Disney-ABC Television Group previously planned to launch a domestic Playhouse Disney Channel in the U.S. (which would have served the same target audience as Disney Junior) in 2001, however, this planned network never launched, although dedicated Playhouse Disney Channels did launch outside of the United States.\n\nDisney XD is a digital cable and satellite television channel in the United States, which is aimed at boys and girls (originally aimed at young male audiences) aged 6–15. The channel was launched on February 13, 2009, and is the successor to Toon Disney; it carries action and comedy programming from Disney Channel and the former Jetix block from Toon Disney, along with some first-run original programming and off-network syndicated shows. Like its predecessor Toon Disney, but unlike parent network Disney Channel and its sister channel Disney Junior, Disney XD operates as an advertiser-supported service. The channel carries the same name as an unrelated mini-site and media player on Disney.com, which stood for Disney Xtreme Digital, though it is said that the \"XD\" in the \"channel\"s name does not have an actual meaning.\nDisney+ is a subscription video on-demand streaming service owned and operated by the Direct-to-Consumer & International (DTCI) division of The Walt Disney Company. The service primarily distributes films and television series produced by The Walt Disney Studios and Walt Disney Television, with the service advertising content from Disney's Marvel, National Geographic, Pixar, and \"Star Wars\" brands in particular.\n\nToon Disney launched on April 18, 1998 (coinciding with the 15th anniversary of parent network Disney Channel's launch), and was aimed at children between the ages of 6 and 18 years old. The network's main competitors were Turner Broadcasting/Time Warner's Cartoon Network and Boomerang, and Viacom/MTV Networks' Nicktoons. Toon Disney originally operated as a commercial-free service from April 1998 to September 1999, when it became advertiser-supported (unlike Disney Channel). The channel carried a mix of reruns of Walt Disney Television Animation and Disney Channel-produced animated programming, along with some third-party programs from other distributors, animated films and original programming. In 2004, the channel debuted a nighttime program block aimed at children ages 7–14 called Jetix, which featured action-oriented animated and live-action series. During Toon Disney's first year on the air, Disney Channel ran a sampler block of Toon Disney's programming on Sunday nights for interested subscribers. The network's successor, Disney XD, a channel also aimed at children, launched on February 13, 2009, and features broader array of programming, with a heavier emphasis on live-action programs.\n\nAnne Sweeney, who was president of Disney Channel from 1996 to 2014, has been the target of criticism. Some critics have disapproved of the marketing strategy that was drafted during her tenure, which has resulted in the slanting of the target audience of Disney Channel's programs toward teenyboppers, as well as a decrease in animated programming and an increase in live-action shows and made-for-TV movies. In 2008, Sweeney had stated that Disney Channel, resulting from its multi-platform marketing strategy using television and music, would become \"the major profit driver for the [Walt Disney] Company.\"\n\nThe channel has also pulled episodes (even once having to reshoot an episode) that have featured subject matter deemed inappropriate due to its humor, the timing of the episode's airing with real-life events, or subject matter considered inappropriate for Disney Channel's target audience. In December 2008, the \"Hannah Montana\" episode \"No Sugar, Sugar\" was pulled before its broadcast after complaints from parents who saw the episode through video on demand services due to misconceptions regarding diabetics and sugar intake (the Mitchel Musso character of Oliver Oken is revealed in the episode to have been diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes). Portions of that episode were subsequently rewritten and re-filmed to become the season three episode \"Uptight (Oliver's Alright),\" which aired in September 2009.\n\nIn December 2011, Disney Channel pulled episodes of two of its original series from the network's broadcast cycle – the season one \"Shake It Up\" episode \"Party It Up,\" and the \"So Random!\" episode \"Colbie Caillat\" – after Demi Lovato (star of \"So Random!\" parent series \"Sonny with a Chance\", who was treated for bulimia nervosa in 2010) objected on Twitter to jokes featured in both episodes (the \"Shake It Up\" episode, in particular) that made light of eating disorders. On May 17, 2013, the channel pulled \"Quitting Cold Koala\", a second-season episode of \"Jessie\", prior to its scheduled premiere broadcast, due to parental concerns over a scene in which a character's gluten-free diet leads to his being ridiculed.\n\nIn 2010, \"Disney Channel All Star Party\" was released for the Nintendo Wii. The four-player mascot party game, in which the stages resemble board games, features characters from Disney Channel programs such as \"Sonny with a Chance\", \"Wizards of Waverly Place\", and \"JONAS L.A.\". Several video games based on the Disney Channel animated series \"Phineas and Ferb\" were released by Disney Interactive Studios. The Disney Channel website also features various Flash games incorporating characters from the channel's various program franchises. There have also been games based on \"Kim Possible\" and \"Hannah Montana\".\n\nDisney Channel has established its channels in various countries worldwide including Canada, France, South Africa, Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, India, Australia, the Czech Republic, New Zealand, the Middle East, Scandinavia, the Baltic states, United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Caribbean, the Netherlands, Israel and Flanders. Disney Channel also licenses its programming to air on certain other broadcast and cable channels outside the United States (previously like Family Channel in Canada) regardless of whether or not an international version of Disney Channel exists in the country.\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "8209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=8209", "title": "Doctor Who", "text": "Doctor Who\n\nDoctor Who is a British science fiction television programme produced by the BBC since 1963. The programme depicts the adventures of a Time Lord called \"the Doctor\", an extraterrestrial being, to all appearances human, from the planet Gallifrey. The Doctor explores the universe in a time-travelling space ship called the TARDIS. Its exterior appears as a blue British police box, which was a common sight in Britain in 1963 when the series first aired. Accompanied by a number of companions, the Doctor combats a variety of foes while working to save civilisations and help people in need.\n\nThe show is a significant part of British popular culture, and elsewhere it has gained a cult following. It has influenced generations of British television professionals, many of whom grew up watching the series. The programme originally ran from 1963 to 1989. There was an unsuccessful attempt to revive regular production in 1996 with a backdoor pilot, in the form of a television film titled \"Doctor Who\". The programme was relaunched in 2005, and since then has been produced in-house by BBC Wales in Cardiff. \"Doctor Who\" has also spawned numerous spin-offs, including comic books, films, novels, audio dramas, and the television series \"Torchwood\" (2006–2011), \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" (2007–2011), \"K-9\" (2009–2010), and \"Class\" (2016), and has been the subject of many parodies and references in popular culture.\n\nThirteen actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. The transition from one actor to another is written into the plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation, a plot device in which a Time Lord \"transforms\" into a new body when the current one is too badly harmed to heal normally. Each actor's portrayal is unique, but all represent stages in the life of the same character, and together, they form a single lifetime with a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The Doctor is currently portrayed by Jodie Whittaker, who took on the role after Peter Capaldi's exit in the 2017 Christmas special \"Twice Upon a Time\".\n\n\"Doctor Who\" follows the adventures of the title character, a rogue Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who goes by the name \"the Doctor\". The Doctor fled Gallifrey in a stolen TARDIS (\"Time and Relative Dimension in Space\"), a time machine that travels by materialising into and dematerialising out of the time vortex. The TARDIS has a vast interior but appears smaller on the outside, and is equipped with a \"chameleon circuit\" intended to make the machine take on the appearance of local objects as a disguise; due to a malfunction, the Doctor's TARDIS remains fixed as a blue British police box.\n\nAcross time and space, the Doctor's many incarnations often find events that pique their curiosity and try to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing history, using only ingenuity and minimal resources, such as the versatile sonic screwdriver. The Doctor rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to share these adventures. These companions are usually humans, owing to the Doctor's fascination with planet Earth, which also leads to frequent collaborations with the international military task force UNIT when the Earth is threatened. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to regenerate in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance and personality. The Doctor has gained numerous reoccurring enemies during their travels, including the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master, another renegade Time Lord.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" first appeared on BBC TV at 17:16:20 GMT on Saturday, 23 November 1963; this was eighty seconds later than the scheduled programme time, due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy the previous day. It was to be a regular weekly programme, each episode 25 minutes of transmission length. Discussions and plans for the programme had been in progress for a year. The head of drama Sydney Newman was mainly responsible for developing the programme, with the first format document for the series being written by Newman along with the head of the script department (later head of serials) Donald Wilson and staff writer C. E. Webber. Writer Anthony Coburn, story editor David Whitaker and initial producer Verity Lambert also heavily contributed to the development of the series.\n\nThe programme was originally intended to appeal to a family audience as an educational programme using time travel as a means to explore scientific ideas and famous moments in history. On 31 July 1963, Whitaker commissioned Terry Nation to write a story under the title \"The Mutants\". As originally written, the Daleks and Thals were the victims of an alien neutron bomb attack but Nation later dropped the aliens and made the Daleks the aggressors. When the script was presented to Newman and Wilson it was immediately rejected as the programme was not permitted to contain any \"bug-eyed monsters\". According to producer Verity Lambert; \"We didn't have a lot of choice — we only had the Dalek serial to go ... We had a bit of a crisis of confidence because Donald [Wilson] was so adamant that we shouldn't make it. Had we had anything else ready we would have made that.\" Nation's script became the second \"Doctor Who\" serial – \"The Daleks\" (also known as \"The Mutants\"). The serial introduced the eponymous aliens that would become the series' most popular monsters, and was responsible for the BBC's first merchandising boom.\n\nThe BBC drama department's serials division produced the programme for 26 seasons, broadcast on BBC 1. Falling viewing numbers, a decline in the public perception of the show and a less-prominent transmission slot saw production suspended in 1989 by Jonathan Powell, controller of BBC 1. Although it was effectively cancelled with the decision not to commission a planned 27th season, which would have been broadcast in 1990, the BBC repeatedly affirmed, over several years, that the series would return.\n\nWhile in-house production had ceased, the BBC hoped to find an independent production company to relaunch the show. Philip Segal, a British expatriate who worked for Columbia Pictures' television arm in the United States, had approached the BBC about such a venture as early as July 1989, while the 26th season was still in production. Segal's negotiations eventually led to a \"Doctor Who\" television film, broadcast on the Fox Network in 1996 as an international co-production between Fox, Universal Pictures, the BBC and BBC Worldwide. Although the film was successful in the UK (with 9.1 million viewers), it was less so in the United States and did not lead to a series.\n\nLicensed media such as novels and audio plays provided new stories, but as a television programme \"Doctor Who\" remained dormant until 2003. In September of that year, BBC Television announced the in-house production of a new series after several years of attempts by BBC Worldwide to find backing for a feature film version. The executive producers of the new incarnation of the series were writer Russell T Davies and BBC Cymru Wales head of drama Julie Gardner.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" finally returned with the episode \"Rose\" on BBC One on 26 March 2005. There have since been ten further series in 2006–2008, 2010–2015 and 2017–2018, and Christmas Day specials every year since 2005. No full series was broadcast in 2009, although four additional specials starring David Tennant were made. Davies left the show in 2010 after the end of series 4 and the David Tennant specials were completed. Steven Moffat, a writer under Davies was announced as Davies' successor along with Matt Smith as the new doctor. In January 2016, Moffat announced that he would step down after the 2017 finale, to be replaced by Chris Chibnall in 2018. The tenth series debuted in April 2017, with a Christmas special preceding it in 2016.\n\nThe 2005 version of \"Doctor Who\" is a direct plot continuation of the original 1963–1989 series and the 1996 telefilm. This is similar to the 1988 continuation of \"\", but differs from most other series relaunches which have either been reboots (for example, \"Battlestar Galactica\" and \"Bionic Woman\") or set in the same universe as the original but in a different time period and with different characters (for example, \"\" and spin-offs).\n\nThe programme has been sold to many other countries worldwide (see Viewership).\n\nIt has been claimed that the transmission of the first episode was delayed by ten minutes due to extended news coverage of the assassination of US President John F. Kennedy the previous day; in fact it went out after a delay of eighty seconds. The BBC believed that many viewers had missed this introduction to a new series due to the coverage of the assassination, as well as a series of power blackouts across the country, and they broadcast it again on 30 November 1963, just before episode two.\n\nThe programme soon became a national institution in the United Kingdom, with a large following among the general viewing audience. Many renowned actors asked for or were offered guest-starring roles in various stories.\n\nWith popularity came controversy over the show's suitability for children. Morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse repeatedly complained to the BBC in the 1970s over what she saw as the show's frightening and gory content. John Nathan-Turner produced the series during the 1980s and was heard to say that he looked forward to Whitehouse's comments, as the show's ratings would increase soon after she had made them.\n\nThe phrase \"Hiding behind (or 'watching from behind') the sofa\" entered British pop culture, signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it. The phrase retains this association with Doctor Who, to the point that in 1991 the Museum of the Moving Image in London named their exhibition celebrating the programme \"Behind the Sofa\". The electronic theme music too was perceived as eerie, novel, and frightening, at the time. A 2012 article placed this childhood juxtaposition of fear and thrill \"at the center of many people's relationship with the show\", and a 2011 online vote at Digital Spy deemed the series the \"scariest TV show of all time\".\n\nDuring Jon Pertwee's second series as the Doctor, in the serial \"Terror of the Autons\" (1971), images of murderous plastic dolls, daffodils killing unsuspecting victims, and blank-featured policemen marked the apex of the show's ability to frighten children. Other notable moments in that decade include a disembodied brain falling to the floor in \"The Brain of Morbius\" and the Doctor apparently being drowned by a villain in \"The Deadly Assassin\" (both 1976).\nA BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that, by their own definition of violence (\"any act[s] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury, hurt or death to persons, animals or property, whether intentional or accidental\") \"Doctor Who\" was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time. The same report found that 3% of the surveyed audience regarded the show as \"very unsuitable\" for family viewing. Responding to the findings of the survey in \"The Times\" newspaper, journalist Philip Howard maintained that, \"to compare the violence of \"Dr Who\", sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare, with the more realistic violence of other television series, where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood, is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London: both are fantasies, but one is meant to be taken seriously.\"\n\nThe image of the TARDIS has become firmly linked to the show in the public's consciousness; BBC scriptwriter Anthony Coburn, who lived in the resort of Herne Bay, Kent, was one of the people who conceived the idea of a police box as a time machine. In 1996, the BBC applied for a trade mark to use the TARDIS' blue police box design in merchandising associated with \"Doctor Who\". In 1998, the Metropolitan Police Authority filed an objection to the trade mark claim; but in 2002, the Patent Office ruled in favour of the BBC.\n\nThe programme's broad appeal attracts audiences of children and families as well as science fiction fans.\n\nThe 21st century revival of the programme has become the centrepiece of BBC One's Saturday schedule, and has \"defined the channel\". Since its return, \"Doctor Who\" has consistently received high ratings, both in number of viewers and as measured by the Appreciation Index. In 2007, Caitlin Moran, television reviewer for \"The Times\", wrote that \"Doctor Who\" is \"quintessential to being British\". Director Steven Spielberg has commented that \"the world would be a poorer place without \"Doctor Who\"\".\n\nOn 4 August 2013, a live programme titled \"Doctor Who Live: The Next Doctor\" was broadcast on BBC One, during which the actor who was going to play the Twelfth Doctor was revealed. The live show was watched by an average of 6.27 million in the UK, and was also simulcast in the United States, Canada and Australia.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" originally ran for 26 seasons on BBC One, from 23 November 1963 until 6 December 1989. During the original run, each weekly episode formed part of a story (or \"serial\") — usually of four to six parts in earlier years and three to four in later years. Some notable exceptions were: \"The Daleks' Master Plan\", which aired twelve episodes (plus an earlier one-episode teaser, \"Mission to the Unknown\", featuring none of the regular cast); almost an entire season of seven-episode serials (season 7); the ten-episode serial \"The War Games\"; and \"The Trial of a Time Lord\", which ran for fourteen episodes (albeit divided into three production codes and four narrative segments) during season 23. Occasionally serials were loosely connected by a story-line, such as season 8 focusing on the Doctor battling a rogue Time Lord called the Master, season 16's quest for the Key to Time, season 18's journey through E-Space and the theme of entropy, and season 20's Black Guardian trilogy.\n\nThe programme was intended to be educational and for family viewing on the early Saturday evening schedule. It initially alternated stories set in the past, which taught younger audience members about history, and with those in the future or outer space, focusing on science. This was also reflected in the Doctor's original companions, one of whom was a science teacher and another a history teacher.\n\nHowever, science fiction stories came to dominate the programme, and the history-orientated episodes, which were not popular with the production team, were dropped after \"The Highlanders\" (1967). While the show continued to use historical settings, they were generally used as a backdrop for science fiction tales, with one exception: \"Black Orchid\" (1982), set in 1920s England.\n\nThe early stories were serialised in nature, with the narrative of one story flowing into the next, and each episode having its own title, although produced as distinct stories with their own production codes. Following \"The Gunfighters\" (1966), however, each serial was given its own title, and the individual parts were simply assigned episode numbers.\n\nOf the programme's many writers, Robert Holmes was the most prolific, while Douglas Adams became the most well known outside \"Doctor Who\" itself, due to the popularity of his \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\" works.\n\nThe serial format changed for the 2005 revival, with a series usually consisting of thirteen 45-minute, self-contained episodes (60 minutes with adverts, on overseas commercial channels), and an extended 60-minute episode broadcast on Christmas Day. This system was shortened to twelve episodes and one Christmas special following the revival's eighth series, and ten episodes from the eleventh series. Each series includes both standalone and multiple episodic stories, linked with a loose story arc that is resolved in the series finale. As in the early \"classic\" era, each episode, whether standalone or part of a larger story, has its own title. Occasionally, regular-series episodes will exceed the 45-minute run time; notably, the episodes \"Journey's End\" from 2008 and \"The Eleventh Hour\" from 2010 exceeded an hour in length.\n\nTo celebrate the 50th anniversary of the show, a special 3D episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", was broadcast in 2013. In March 2013, it was announced that Tennant and Piper would be returning, and that the episode would have a limited cinematic release worldwide.\n\nIn April 2015, Steven Moffat confirmed that \"Doctor Who\" would run for at least another five years, extending the show until 2020. In June 2017, it was announced that due to the terms of a deal between BBC Worldwide and SMG Pictures in China, the company has first right of refusal on the purchase for the Chinese market of future series of the programme until and including Series 15.\n\nBetween about 1967 and 1978, large amounts of older material stored in the BBC's various video tape and film libraries were either destroyed, wiped, or suffered from poor storage which led to severe deterioration from broadcast quality. This included many old episodes of \"Doctor Who\", mostly stories featuring the first two Doctors: William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton. In all, 97 of 253 episodes produced during the first six years of the programme are not held in the BBC's archives (most notably seasons 3, 4, 5, from which 79 episodes are missing). In 1972, almost all episodes then made were known to exist at the BBC, while by 1978 the practice of wiping tapes and destroying \"spare\" film copies had been brought to a stop.\n\nNo 1960s episodes exist on their original videotapes (all surviving prints being film transfers), though some were transferred to film for editing before transmission, and exist in their broadcast form.\n\nSome episodes have been returned to the BBC from the archives of other countries who bought prints for broadcast, or by private individuals who acquired them by various means. Early colour videotape recordings made off-air by fans have also been retrieved, as well as excerpts filmed from the television screen onto 8 mm cine film and clips that were shown on other programmes. Audio versions of all of the lost episodes exist from home viewers who made tape recordings of the show. Short clips from every story with the exception of \"Marco Polo\" (1964), \"Mission to the Unknown\" (1965) and \"The Massacre of St Bartholomew's Eve\" (1966) also exist.\n\nIn addition to these, there are off-screen photographs made by photographer John Cura, who was hired by various production personnel to document many of their programmes during the 1950s and 1960s, including \"Doctor Who\". These have been used in fan reconstructions of the serials. These amateur reconstructions have been tolerated by the BBC, provided they are not sold for profit and are distributed as low-quality copies.\n\nOne of the most sought-after lost episodes is part four of the last William Hartnell serial, \"The Tenth Planet\" (1966), which ends with the First Doctor transforming into the Second. The only portion of this in existence, barring a few poor-quality silent 8 mm clips, is the few seconds of the regeneration scene, as it was shown on the children's magazine show \"Blue Peter\". With the approval of the BBC, efforts are now under way to restore as many of the episodes as possible from the extant material.\n\n\"Official\" reconstructions have also been released by the BBC on VHS, on MP3 CD-ROM, and as special features on DVD. The BBC, in conjunction with animation studio Cosgrove Hall, reconstructed the missing episodes 1 and 4 of \"The Invasion\" (1968), using remastered audio tracks and the comprehensive stage notes for the original filming, for the serial's DVD release in November 2006. The missing episodes of \"The Reign of Terror\" were animated by animation company Theta-Sigma, in collaboration with Big Finish, and became available for purchase in May 2013 through Amazon.com. Subsequent animations made in 2013 include \"The Tenth Planet\", \"The Ice Warriors\" (1967) and \"The Moonbase\" (1967).\n\nIn April 2006, \"Blue Peter\" launched a challenge to find missing \"Doctor Who\" episodes with the promise of a full-scale Dalek model as a reward.\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced that part 3 of \"Galaxy 4\" (1965) and part 2 of \"The Underwater Menace\" (1967) had been returned to the BBC by a fan who had purchased them in the mid-1980s without realising that the BBC did not hold copies of them.\n\nOn 10 October 2013, the BBC announced that films of eleven episodes, including nine missing episodes, had been found in a Nigerian television relay station in Jos. Six of the eleven films discovered were the six-part serial \"The Enemy of the World\" (1968), from which all but the third episode had been missing. The remaining films were from another six-part serial, \"The Web of Fear\" (1968), and included the previously missing episodes 2, 4, 5, and 6. Episode 3 of \"The Web of Fear\" is still missing.\n\nThe Doctor was initially shrouded in mystery. In the programme's early days, the character was an eccentric alien traveller of great intelligence who battled injustice while exploring time and space in an unreliable time machine, the \"TARDIS\" (an acronym for Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which notably appears much larger on the inside than on the outside (a quality referred to as \"dimensional transcendentality\").\n\nThe initially irascible and slightly sinister Doctor quickly mellowed into a more compassionate figure and was eventually revealed to be a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, which the Doctor fled by stealing the TARDIS.\n\nProducers introduced the concept of regeneration to permit the recasting of the main character. This was prompted by the poor health of the original star, William Hartnell. The term \"regeneration\" was not conceived until the Doctor's third on-screen regeneration; Hartnell's Doctor merely described undergoing a \"renewal\", and the Second Doctor underwent a \"change of appearance\". The device has allowed for the recasting of the actor various times in the show's history, as well as the depiction of alternative Doctors either from the Doctor's relative past or future.\n\nThe serials \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976) and \"Mawdryn Undead\" (1983) established that a Time Lord can only regenerate 12 times, for a total of 13 incarnations. This line became stuck in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. The episode \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) depicted the Doctor acquiring a new cycle of regenerations, starting from the Twelfth Doctor, due to the Eleventh Doctor being the product of the Doctor's twelfth regeneration from his original set.\n\nAlthough the idea of casting a woman as the Doctor had been suggested by the show's writers several times, including by Newman in 1986 and Davies in 2008, until 2017, all official depictions were played by men. Jodie Whittaker took over the role as the Thirteenth Doctor at the end of the 2017 Christmas special, and is the first woman to be cast as the character. Whittaker had previously starred in television series such as \"Return to Cranford\", \"Broadchurch\" alongside David Tennant (Tenth Doctor) and the dystopian anthology \"Black Mirror\". The show introduced the Time Lords' ability to change gender on regeneration in earlier episodes, first in dialogue, then with Michelle Gomez's version of The Master.\n\nIn addition to those actors who have headlined the series, others have portrayed versions of the Doctor in guest roles. Notably, in 2013, John Hurt guest-starred as a hitherto unknown incarnation of the Doctor known as the War Doctor in the run-up to the show's 50th anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\". He is shown in mini-episode \"The Night of the Doctor\" retroactively inserted into the show's fictional chronology between McGann and Eccleston's Doctors, although his introduction was written so as not to disturb the established numerical naming of the Doctors. Another example is from the 1986 serial \"The Trial of a Time Lord\", where Michael Jayston portrayed the Valeyard, who is described as an amalgamation of the darker sides of the Doctor's nature, somewhere between the twelfth and final incarnation.\n\nOn rare occasions, other actors have stood in for the lead. In \"The Five Doctors\", Richard Hurndall played the First Doctor due to William Hartnell's death in 1975; 34 years later David Bradley similarly replaced Hartnell in \"Twice Upon a Time\". In \"Time and the Rani\", Sylvester McCoy briefly played the Sixth Doctor during the regeneration sequence, carrying on as the Seventh. For more information, see the list of actors who have played the Doctor. In other media, the Doctor has been played by various other actors, including Peter Cushing in two films.\n\nThe casting of a new Doctor has often inspired debate and speculation. Common topics of focus include the Doctor's gender (prior to the casting of Whittaker, all official incarnations were male), race (all Doctors to date have been white) and age (the youngest actor to be cast is Smith at 26, and the oldest are Capaldi and Hartnell, both 55).\n\nThere have been instances of actors returning at later dates to reprise the role of their specific Doctor. In 1973's \"The Three Doctors\", William Hartnell and Patrick Troughton returned alongside Jon Pertwee. For 1983's \"The Five Doctors\", Troughton and Pertwee returned to star with Peter Davison, and Tom Baker appeared in previously unseen footage from the uncompleted \"Shada\" serial. For this episode, Richard Hurndall replaced William Hartnell. Patrick Troughton again returned in 1985's \"The Two Doctors\" with Colin Baker. In 2007, Peter Davison returned in the Children in Need short \"Time Crash\" alongside David Tennant. In \"The Name of the Doctor\" (2013), the Eleventh Doctor meets a previously unseen incarnation of himself, subsequently revealed to be the War Doctor. In the following episode, \"The Day of the Doctor\", David Tennant's Tenth Doctor appeared alongside Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor and John Hurt as the War Doctor, as well as brief footage from all of the previous actors. Additionally, multiple incarnations of the Doctor have met in various audio dramas and novels based on the television show. In 2017, the First Doctor (this time portrayed by David Bradley) returned alongside Peter Capaldi in \"The Doctor Falls\" and \"Twice Upon a Time\".\n\nThroughout the programme's long history, there have been revelations about the Doctor that have raised additional questions. In \"The Brain of Morbius\" (1976), it was hinted that the First Doctor might not have been the first incarnation (although the other faces depicted might have been incarnations of the Time Lord Morbius). In subsequent stories the First Doctor was depicted as the earliest incarnation of the Doctor. In \"Mawdryn Undead\" (1983), the Fifth Doctor explicitly confirmed that he was then currently in his fifth incarnation. Later that same year, during 1983's 20th Anniversary special \"The Five Doctors\", the First Doctor enquires as to the Fifth Doctor's regeneration; when the Fifth Doctor confirms \"Fourth\", the First Doctor excitedly replies \"Goodness me. So there are five of me now.\" In 2010, the Eleventh Doctor similarly calls himself \"the Eleventh\" in \"The Lodger\". In the 2013 episode \"The Time of the Doctor,\" the Eleventh Doctor clarified he was the product of the twelfth regeneration, due to a previous incarnation which he chose not to count and one other aborted regeneration. The name Eleventh is still used for this incarnation; the same episode depicts the prophesied \"Fall of the Eleventh\" which had been trailed throughout the series.\n\nDuring the Seventh Doctor's era, it was hinted that the Doctor was more than just an ordinary Time Lord. In the 1996 television film, the Eighth Doctor describes himself as being \"half human\". The BBC's FAQ for the programme notes that \"purists tend to disregard this\", instead focusing on his Gallifreyan heritage.\n\nThe programme's first serial, \"An Unearthly Child\", shows that the Doctor has a granddaughter, Susan Foreman. In the 1967 serial, \"Tomb of the Cybermen\", when Victoria Waterfield doubts the Doctor can remember his family because of, \"being so ancient\", the Doctor says that he can when he really wants to—\"The rest of the time they sleep in my mind\". The 2005 series reveals that the Ninth Doctor thought he was the last surviving Time Lord, and that his home planet had been destroyed; in \"The Empty Child\" (2005), Dr. Constantine states that, \"Before the war even began, I was a father and a grandfather. Now I am neither.\" The Doctor remarks in response, \"Yeah, I know the feeling.\" In \"Smith and Jones\" (2007), when asked if he had a brother, he replied, \"No, not any more.\" In both \"Fear Her\" (2006) and \"The Doctor's Daughter\" (2008), he states that he had, in the past, been a father.\n\nIn \"The Wedding of River Song\" (2011), it is implied that the Doctor's true name is a secret that must never be revealed; this is explored further in \"The Name of the Doctor\" (2013), when River Song speaking his name allows the Great Intelligence to enter his tomb, and in \"The Time of the Doctor\" (2013) where speaking his true name becomes the signal by which the Time Lords would know they can safely return to the universe.\n\nThe companion figure – generally a human – has been a constant feature in \"Doctor Who\" since the programme's inception in 1963. One of the roles of the companion is to be a reminder for the Doctor's \"moral duty\". The Doctor's first companions seen on screen were his granddaughter Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford) and her teachers Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell). These characters were intended to act as audience surrogates, through which the audience would discover information about the Doctor who was to act as a mysterious father figure. The only story from the original series in which the Doctor travels alone is \"The Deadly Assassin\" (1976). Notable companions from the earlier series included Romana (Mary Tamm and Lalla Ward), a Time Lady; Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen); and Jo Grant (Katy Manning). Dramatically, these characters provide a figure with whom the audience can identify, and serve to further the story by requesting exposition from the Doctor and manufacturing peril for the Doctor to resolve. The Doctor regularly gains new companions and loses old ones; sometimes they return home or find new causes — or loves — on worlds they have visited. Some have died during the course of the series. Companions are usually human, or humanoid aliens.\n\nSince the 2005 revival, the Doctor generally travels with a primary female companion, who occupies a larger narrative role. Steven Moffat described the companion as the main character of the show, as the story begins anew with each companion and she undergoes more change than the Doctor. The primary companions of the Ninth and Tenth Doctors were Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman), and Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) with Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) and Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) recurring as secondary companion figures. The Eleventh Doctor became the first to travel with a married couple, Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill), whilst out-of-sync meetings with River Song (Alex Kingston) and Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) provided ongoing story arcs. The tenth series introduced Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts, the Doctor's first openly-gay companion. Pearl Mackie said that the increased representation for LGBTQ people is important on a mainstream show.\n\nSome companions have gone on to re-appear, either in the main series or in spin-offs. Sarah Jane Smith became the central character in \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" (2007–11) following a return to \"Doctor Who\" in 2006. Guest stars in the series included former companions Jo Grant, K9, and Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart (Nicholas Courtney). The character of Jack Harkness also served to launch a spin-off, \"Torchwood\", (2006–2011) in which Martha Jones also appeared.\n\nWhen Sydney Newman commissioned the series, he specifically did not want to perpetuate the cliché of the \"bug-eyed monster\" of science fiction. However, monsters were popular with audiences and so became a staple of \"Doctor Who\" almost from the beginning.\n\nWith the show's 2005 revival, executive producer Russell T Davies stated his intention to reintroduce classic icons of \"Doctor Who\". The Autons with the Nestene Consciousness and Daleks returned in series 1, Cybermen in series 2, the Macra and the Master in series 3, the Sontarans and Davros in series 4, and the Time Lords including Rassilon in the 2009–10 Specials. Davies' successor, Steven Moffat, has continued the trend by reviving the Silurians in series 5, Cybermats in series 6, the Great Intelligence and the Ice Warriors in Series 7, and Zygons in the 50th Anniversary Special. Since its 2005 return, the series has also introduced new recurring aliens: Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorians), Ood, Judoon, Weeping Angels and the Silence.\n\nBesides infrequent appearances by enemies such as the Ice Warriors, Ogrons, the Rani, and Black Guardian, three adversaries have become particularly iconic: the Daleks, the Cybermen, and the Master.\n\nThe Dalek race, which first appeared in the show's second serial in 1963, are \"Doctor Who\"s oldest villains. The Daleks are Kaleds from the planet Skaro, mutated by the scientist Davros and housed in mechanical armour shells for mobility. The actual creatures resemble octopuses with large, pronounced brains. Their armour shells have a single eye-stalk, a sink-plunger-like device that serves the purpose of a hand, and a directed-energy weapon. Their main weakness is their eyestalk; attacks upon them using various weapons can blind a Dalek, making it go mad. Their chief role in the series plot, as they frequently remark in their instantly recognisable metallic voices, is to \"exterminate\" all non-Dalek beings. They even attack the Time Lords in the Time War, as shown during the 50th Anniversary of the show. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the Doctor Who franchise, their most recent appearance being the 2019 episodes \"Resolution\". Davros has also been a recurring figure since his debut in \"Genesis of the Daleks\", although played by several different actors.\n\nThe Daleks were created by writer Terry Nation (who intended them to be an allegory of the Nazis) and BBC designer Raymond Cusick. The Daleks' début in the programme's second serial, \"The Daleks\" (1963–64), made both the Daleks and \"Doctor Who\" very popular. A Dalek appeared on a postage stamp celebrating British popular culture in 1999, photographed by Lord Snowdon. In \"Victory of the Daleks\" a new set of Daleks were introduced that come in a range of colours; the colour denoting its role within the species.\n\nCybermen were originally a wholly organic species of humanoids originating on Earth's twin planet Mondas that began to implant more and more artificial parts into their bodies. This led to the race becoming coldly logical and calculating cyborgs, with emotions usually only shown when naked aggression was called for. With the demise of Mondas, they acquired Telos as their new home planet. They continue to be a recurring 'monster' within the \"Doctor Who\" franchise.\n\nThe 2006 series introduced a totally new variation of Cybermen. These Cybus Cybermen were created in a parallel universe by the mad inventor John Lumic; he was attempting to preserve the humans by transplanting their brains into powerful metal bodies, sending them orders using a mobile phone network and inhibiting their emotions with an electronic chip.\n\nThe Master is the Doctor's archenemy, a renegade Time Lord who desires to rule the universe. Conceived as \"Professor Moriarty to the Doctor's Sherlock Holmes\", the character first appeared in 1971. As with the Doctor, the role has been portrayed by several actors, since the Master is a Time Lord as well and able to regenerate; the first of these actors was Roger Delgado, who continued in the role until his death in 1973. The Master was briefly played by Peter Pratt and Geoffrey Beevers until Anthony Ainley took over and continued to play the character until Doctor Who's hiatus in 1989. The Master returned in the 1996 television movie of \"Doctor Who\", and was played by American actor Eric Roberts.\n\nFollowing the series revival in 2005, Derek Jacobi provided the character's re-introduction in the 2007 episode \"Utopia\". During that story, the role was then assumed by John Simm who returned to the role multiple times through the Tenth Doctor's tenure. As of the 2014 episode \"Dark Water\", it was revealed that the Master had become a female incarnation or \"Time Lady\", going by the name of \"Missy\" (short for Mistress, the feminine equivalent of \"Master\"). This incarnation is played by Michelle Gomez.\n\nJohn Simm returned in his role as the Master in the tenth series.\n\nThe \"Doctor Who\" theme music was one of the first electronic music signature tunes for television, and after more than a half century remains one of the most easily recognised. The original theme was composed by Ron Grainer and realised by Delia Derbyshire of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, with assistance from Dick Mills and was released as a single on Decca F 11837 in 1964. The various parts were built up using musique concrète techniques, by creating tape loops of an individually struck piano string and individual test oscillators and filters. The Derbyshire arrangement served, with minor edits, as the theme tune up to the end of season 17 (1979–80). It is regarded as a significant and innovative piece of electronic music, recorded well before the availability of commercial synthesisers or multitrack mixers. Each note was individually created by cutting, splicing, speeding up and slowing down segments of analogue tape containing recordings of a single plucked string, white noise, and the simple harmonic waveforms of test-tone oscillators, intended for calibrating equipment and rooms, not creating music. New techniques were invented to allow mixing of the music, as this was before the era of multitrack tape machines. On hearing the finished result, Grainer asked, \"Jeez, Delia, did I write that?\" Although Grainer was willing to give Derbyshire the co-composer credit, it was against BBC policy at the time.\n\nA different arrangement was recorded by Peter Howell for season 18 (1980), which was in turn replaced by Dominic Glynn's arrangement for the season-long serial \"The Trial of a Time Lord\" in season 23 (1986). Keff McCulloch provided the new arrangement for the Seventh Doctor's era which lasted from season 24 (1987) until the series' suspension in 1989. American composer John Debney created a new arrangement of Ron Grainer's original theme for \"Doctor Who\" in 1996. For the return of the series in 2005, Murray Gold provided a new arrangement which featured samples from the 1963 original with further elements added; in the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\".\n\nA new arrangement of the theme, once again by Gold, was introduced in the 2007 Christmas special episode, \"Voyage of the Damned\"; Gold returned as composer for the 2010 series. He was responsible for a new version of the theme which was reported to have had a hostile reception from some viewers. In 2011, the theme tune charted at number 228 of radio station Classic FM's Hall of Fame, a survey of classical music tastes. A revised version of Gold's 2010 arrangement had its debut over the opening titles of the 2012 Christmas special \"The Snowmen\", and a further revision of the arrangement was made for the 50th Anniversary special \"The Day of the Doctor\" in November 2013.\n\nVersions of the \"Doctor Who Theme\" have also been released as pop music over the years. In the early 1970s, Jon Pertwee, who had played the Third Doctor, recorded a version of the Doctor Who theme with spoken lyrics, titled, \"Who Is the Doctor\". In 1978 a disco version of the theme was released in the UK, Denmark and Australia by the group Mankind, which reached number 24 in the UK charts. In 1988 the band The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu (later known as The KLF) released the single \"Doctorin' the Tardis\" under the name The Timelords, which reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 2 in Australia; this version incorporated several other songs, including \"Rock and Roll Part 2\" by Gary Glitter (who recorded vocals for some of the CD-single remix versions of \"Doctorin' the Tardis\"). Others who have covered or reinterpreted the theme include Orbital, Pink Floyd, the Australian string ensemble Fourplay, New Zealand punk band Blam Blam Blam, The Pogues, Thin Lizzy, Dub Syndicate, and the comedians Bill Bailey and Mitch Benn. Both the theme and obsessive fans were satirised on \"The Chaser's War on Everything\". The theme tune has also appeared on many compilation CDs, and has made its way into mobile-phone ringtones. Fans have also produced and distributed their own remixes of the theme. In January 2011 the Mankind version was released as a digital download on the album \"Gallifrey And Beyond\".\n\nOn 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for series 11 would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola.\n\nMost of the innovative incidental music for \"Doctor Who\" has been specially commissioned from freelance composers, although in the early years some episodes also used stock music, as well as occasional excerpts from original recordings or cover versions of songs by popular music acts such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys. Since its 2005 return, the series has featured occasional use of excerpts of pop music from the 1970s to the 2000s.\n\nThe incidental music for the first \"Doctor Who\" adventure, \"An Unearthly Child\", was written by Norman Kay. Many of the stories of the William Hartnell period were scored by electronic music pioneer Tristram Cary, whose \"Doctor Who\" credits include \"The Daleks\", \"Marco Polo\", \"The Daleks' Master Plan\", \"The Gunfighters\" and \"The Mutants\". Other composers in this early period included Richard Rodney Bennett, Carey Blyton and Geoffrey Burgon.\n\nThe most frequent musical contributor during the first 15 years was Dudley Simpson, who is also well known for his theme and incidental music for \"Blake's 7\", and for his haunting theme music and score for the original 1970s version of \"The Tomorrow People\". Simpson's first \"Doctor Who\" score was \"Planet of Giants\" (1964) and he went on to write music for many adventures of the 1960s and 1970s, including most of the stories of the Jon Pertwee/Tom Baker periods, ending with \"The Horns of Nimon\" (1979). He also made a cameo appearance in \"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\" (as a Music hall conductor).\n\nIn 1980 starting with the serial \"The Leisure Hive\" the task of creating incidental music was assigned to the Radiophonic Workshop. Paddy Kingsland and Peter Howell contributed many scores in this period and other contributors included Roger Limb, Malcolm Clarke and Jonathan Gibbs.\n\nThe Radiophonic Workshop was dropped after 1986's \"The Trial of a Time Lord\" series, and Keff McCulloch took over as the series' main composer until the end of its run, with Dominic Glynn and Mark Ayres also contributing scores.\n\nFrom the 2005 revival to the 2017 Christmas episode \"Twice Upon a Time\", all incidental music for the series was composed by Murray Gold and Ben Foster, and has been performed by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales from the 2005 Christmas episode \"The Christmas Invasion\" onwards. A concert featuring the orchestra performing music from the first two series took place on 19 November 2006 to raise money for Children in Need. David Tennant hosted the event, introducing the different sections of the concert. Murray Gold and Russell T Davies answered questions during the interval and Daleks and Cybermen appeared whilst music from their stories was played. The concert aired on BBCi on Christmas Day 2006. A Doctor Who Prom was celebrated on 27 July 2008 in the Royal Albert Hall as part of the annual BBC Proms. The BBC Philharmonic and the London Philharmonic Choir performed Murray Gold's compositions for the series, conducted by Ben Foster, as well as a selection of classics based on the theme of space and time. The event was presented by Freema Agyeman and guest-presented by various other stars of the show with numerous monsters participating in the proceedings. It also featured the specially filmed mini-episode \"Music of the Spheres\", written by Russell T Davies and starring David Tennant.\n\nOn 26 June 2018, producer Chris Chibnall announced that the musical score for the eleventh series would be provided by Royal Birmingham Conservatoire alumnus Segun Akinola.\n\nSix soundtrack releases have been released since 2005. The featured tracks from the first two series, the and featured music from the third and fourth series respectively. The was released on 4 October 2010 as a two disc special edition and contained music from the 2008–2010 specials (\"The Next Doctor\" to \"End of Time Part 2\"). The was released on 8 November 2010. In February 2011, a soundtrack was released for the 2010 Christmas special: \"A Christmas Carol\", and in December 2011 the was released, both by Silva Screen Records.\n\nIn 2013, a 50th-anniversary boxed set of audio CDs was released featuring music and sound effects from Doctor Who's 50-year history. The celebration continued in 2016 with the release of Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection Four LP Box Set by New York City-based Spacelab9. The company pressed 1,000 copies of the set on \"Metallic Silver\" vinyl, dubbed the \"Cyberman Edition\".\n\nPremiering the day after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the first episode of \"Doctor Who\" was repeated with the second episode the following week. \"Doctor Who\" has always appeared initially on the BBC's mainstream BBC One channel, where it is regarded as a family show, drawing audiences of many millions of viewers; episodes were also repeated on BBC Three, before its transition to an online-only channel . The programme's popularity has waxed and waned over the decades, with three notable periods of high ratings. The first of these was the \"Dalekmania\" period (circa 1964–1965), when the popularity of the Daleks regularly brought \"Doctor Who\" ratings of between 9 and 14 million, even for stories which did not feature them. The second was the mid to late 1970s, when Tom Baker occasionally drew audiences of over 12 million.\n\nAn audience survey during the 1970s revealed that at the time 60% of the viewership were adults.\n\nDuring the ITV network strike of 1979, viewership peaked at 16 million. Figures remained respectable into the 1980s, but fell noticeably after the programme's 23rd series was postponed in 1985 and the show was off the air for 18 months. At the time of Season 19's broadcast in 1982 the show was being watched by a global audience of 98 million, 88 million in 38 foreign countries, and an average of ten million in the United Kingdom.\n\nIts late 1980s performance of three to five million viewers was seen as poor at the time and was, according to the BBC Board of Control, a leading cause of the programme's 1989 suspension. Some fans considered this disingenuous, since the programme was scheduled against the soap opera \"Coronation Street\", the most popular show at the time. During Tennant's run (the third notable period of high ratings), the show had consistently high viewership; with the Christmas specials regularly attracting over 10 million.\n\nThe BBC One broadcast of \"Rose\", the first episode of the 2005 revival, drew an average audience of 10.81 million, third highest for BBC One that week and seventh across all channels. The current revival also garners the highest audience Appreciation Index of any drama on television.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" has been broadcast internationally outside of the United Kingdom since 1964, a year after the show first aired. , the modern series has been or is currently broadcast weekly in more than 50 countries.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" is one of the five top-grossing titles for BBC Worldwide, the BBC's commercial arm. BBC Worldwide CEO John Smith has said that \"Doctor Who\" is one of a small number of \"Superbrands\" which Worldwide will promote heavily.\n\nOnly four episodes have ever had their premiere showings on channels other than BBC One. The 1983 20th anniversary special \"The Five Doctors\" had its début on 23 November (the actual date of the anniversary) on a number of PBS stations two days prior to its BBC One broadcast. The 1988 story \"Silver Nemesis\" was broadcast with all three episodes airing back to back on TVNZ in New Zealand in November, after the first episode had been shown in the UK but before the final two instalments had aired there. Finally, the 1996 television film premiered on 12 May 1996 on CITV in Edmonton, Canada, 15 days before the BBC One showing, and two days before it aired on Fox in the United States.\n\nNew Zealand was the first country outside the United Kingdom to screen \"Doctor Who\", beginning in September 1964, and continued to screen the series for many years, including the new series from 2005. In 2018, the series is aired on Fridays on TVNZ 2, and on TVNZ On Demand on the same episode as the UK.\n\nIn Australia, the show has had a strong fan base since its inception, having been exclusively first run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) since January 1965. (See Doctor Who in Australia) The ABC has periodically repeated episodes; of note were the weekly screenings of all available classic episodes starting in 2003, for the show's 40th anniversary, and the weekdaily screenings of all available revived episodes in 2013 for the show's 50th anniversary. The ABC broadcasts the modern series first run on ABC1 and ABC ME, with repeats on ABC2. The ABC also provided partial funding for the 20th anniversary special \"The Five Doctors\" in 1983.\n\nThe series also has a fan base in the United States, where it was shown in syndication from the 1970s to the 1990s, particularly on PBS stations.\n\nTVOntario picked up the show in 1976 beginning with \"The Three Doctors\" and aired each series (several years late) through to series 24 in 1991. From 1979 to 1981, TVO airings were bookended by science-fiction writer Judith Merril who introduced the episode and then, after the episode concluded, tried to place it in an educational context in keeping with TVO's status as an educational channel. Its airing of \"The Talons of Weng-Chiang\" was cancelled as a result of accusations that the story was racist; the story was later broadcast in the 1990s on cable station YTV. CBC began showing the series again in 2005. The series moved to the Canadian cable channel Space in 2009.\n\nFor the Canadian broadcast, Christopher Eccleston recorded special video introductions for each episode (including a trivia question as part of a viewer contest) and excerpts from the \"Doctor Who Confidential\" documentary were played over the closing credits; for the broadcast of \"The Christmas Invasion\" on 26 December 2005, Billie Piper recorded a special video introduction. CBC began airing series two on 9 October 2006 at 20:00 E/P (20:30 in Newfoundland and Labrador), shortly after that day's CFL double header on Thanksgiving in most of the country.\n\nSeries three began broadcasting on CBC on 18 June 2007 followed by the second Christmas special, \"The Runaway Bride\" at midnight, and the Sci Fi Channel began on 6 July 2007 starting with the second Christmas special at 8:00 pm E/P followed by the first episode.\n\nSeries four aired in the United States on the Sci Fi Channel (now known as Syfy), beginning in April 2008. It aired on CBC beginning 19 September 2008, although the CBC did not air the \"Voyage of the Damned\" special. The Canadian cable network Space (now known as CTV Sci-Fi Channel) broadcast \"The Next Doctor\" (in March 2009) and all subsequent series and specials.\n\nSeries 1 through 3 of Doctor Who were broadcast on various NHK channels from 2006 to 2008 with Japanese subtitles. Beginning in 2 August 2009, upon the launch of Disney XD in Japan, the series has been broadcast with Japanese dubbing.\n\nA wide selection of serials are available from BBC Video on DVD, on sale in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and the United States. Every fully extant serial has been released on VHS, and BBC Worldwide continues to regularly release serials on DVD. The 2005 series is also available in its entirety on UMD for the PlayStation Portable. Eight original series serials have been released on Laserdisc and many have also been released on Betamax tape and Video 2000. One episode of Doctor Who (The Infinite Quest) was released on VCD. Only the series from 2005 onwards are also available on Blu-ray, except for the 1970 story \"Spearhead from Space\", released in July 2013 and the 1996 TV film \"Doctor Who\" released in September 2016. Many early releases have been re-released as special editions, with more bonus features.\n\nThere are two Dr. Who feature films: \"Dr. Who and the Daleks\", released in 1965 and \"Daleks' Invasion Earth 2150 A.D.\" in 1966. Both are retellings of existing television stories (specifically, the first two Dalek serials, \"The Daleks\" and \"The Dalek Invasion of Earth\" respectively) with a larger budget and alterations to the series concept.\n\nIn these films, Peter Cushing plays a human scientist named \"Dr. Who\", who travels with his granddaughter, niece and other companions in a time machine he has invented. The Cushing version of the character reappears in both comic strips and a short story, the latter attempting to reconcile the film continuity with that of the series.\n\nIn addition, several planned films were proposed, including a sequel, \"The Chase\", loosely based on the original series story, for the Cushing Doctor, plus many attempted television movie and big screen productions to revive the original \"Doctor Who\", after the original series was cancelled.\n\nPaul McGann starred in the only television film as the eighth incarnation of the Doctor. After the film, he continued the role in audio books and was confirmed as the eighth incarnation through flashback footage and a mini episode in the 2005 revival, effectively linking the two series and the television movie.\n\nIn 2011, David Yates announced that he had started work with the BBC on a \"Doctor Who\" film, a project that would take three or more years to complete. Yates indicated that the film would take a different approach to \"Doctor Who\", although then \"Doctor Who\" showrunner Steven Moffat stated later that any such film would not be a reboot of the series and a film should be made by the BBC team and star the current TV Doctor.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" has appeared on stage numerous times. In the early 1970s, Trevor Martin played the role in \"Doctor Who and the Daleks in the Seven Keys to Doomsday\". In the late 1980s, Jon Pertwee and Colin Baker both played the Doctor at different times during the run of a play titled \"Doctor Who – The Ultimate Adventure\". For two performances, while Pertwee was ill, David Banks (better known for playing Cybermen) played the Doctor. Other original plays have been staged as amateur productions, with other actors playing the Doctor, while Terry Nation wrote \"The Curse of the Daleks\", a stage play mounted in the late 1960s, but without the Doctor.\n\nA pilot episode (\"A Girl's Best Friend\") for a potential spinoff series, \"K-9 and Company\", was aired in 1981 with Elisabeth Sladen reprising her role as companion Sarah Jane Smith and John Leeson as the voice of K9, but was not picked up as a regular series.\n\nConcept art for an animated \"Doctor Who\" series was produced by animation company Nelvana in the 1980s, but the series was not produced.\n\nFollowing the success of the 2005 series produced by Russell T Davies, the BBC commissioned Davies to produce a 13-part spin-off series titled \"Torchwood\" (an anagram of \"Doctor Who\"), set in modern-day Cardiff and investigating alien activities and crime. The series debuted on BBC Three on 22 October 2006. John Barrowman reprised his role of Jack Harkness from the 2005 series of \"Doctor Who\". Two other actresses who appeared in Doctor Who also star in the series; Eve Myles as Gwen Cooper, who also played the similarly named servant girl Gwyneth in the 2005 \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Unquiet Dead\", and Naoko Mori who reprised her role as Toshiko Sato first seen in \"Aliens of London\". A second series of \"Torchwood\" aired in 2008; for three episodes, the cast was joined by Freema Agyeman reprising her \"Doctor Who\" role of Martha Jones. A third series was broadcast from 6 to 10 July 2009, and consisted of a single five-part story called \"Children of Earth\" which was set largely in London. A fourth series, \"\" jointly produced by BBC Wales, BBC Worldwide and the American entertainment company Starz debuted in 2011. The series was predominantly set in the United States, though Wales remained part of the show's setting.\n\n\"The Sarah Jane Adventures\", starring Elisabeth Sladen who reprised her role as investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, was developed by CBBC; a special aired on New Year's Day 2007 and a full series began on 24 September 2007. A second series followed in 2008, notable for (as noted above) featuring the return of Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart. A third in 2009 featured a crossover appearance from the main show by David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. In 2010, a further such appearance featured Matt Smith as the Eleventh Doctor alongside former companion actress Katy Manning reprising her role as Jo Grant. A final, three-story fifth series was transmitted in autumn 2011 – uncompleted due to the death of Elisabeth Sladen in early 2011.\n\nAn animated serial, \"The Infinite Quest\", aired alongside the 2007 series of \"Doctor Who\" as part of the children's television series \"Totally Doctor Who\". The serial featured the voices of series regulars David Tennant and Freema Agyeman but is not considered part of the 2007 series. A second animated serial, \"Dreamland\", aired in six parts on the BBC Red Button service, and the official \"Doctor Who\" website in 2009.\n\n\"Class\", featuring students of Coal Hill School, was first aired on-line on BBC Three from 22 October 2016, as a series of eight 45 minute episodes, written by Patrick Ness. Peter Capaldi as the Twelfth Doctor appears in the show's first episode. The series was picked up by BBC America on 8 January 2016 and by BBC One a day later. On 7 September 2017, BBC Three controller Damian Kavanagh confirmed that the series had officially been cancelled.\n\nNumerous other spin-off series have been created not by the BBC but by the respective owners of the characters and concepts. Such spin-offs include the novel and audio drama series \"Faction Paradox\", \"Iris Wildthyme\" and \"Bernice Summerfield\"; as well as the made-for-video series \"P.R.O.B.E.\"; the Australian-produced television series \"K-9\", which aired a 26-episode first season on Disney XD; and the audio spin-off \"Counter-Measures\".\n\nWhen the revived series of \"Doctor Who\" was brought back, an aftershow series was created by the BBC, titled \"Doctor Who Confidential\". There have been three aftershow series created, with the latest one titled \"\", which began airing from the tenth series. Each series follows behind-the-scenes footage on the making of \"Doctor Who\" through clips and interviews with the cast, production crew and other people, including those who have participated in the television series in some manner. Each episode deals with a different topic, and in most cases refers to the \"Doctor Who\" episode that preceded it.\n\nIn 1983, coinciding with the series' 20th anniversary, \"The Five Doctors\" was shown as part of the annual BBC Children in Need Appeal, however it was not a charity-based production, simply scheduled within the line-up of Friday 25 November 1983. This was the programme's very first co-production with Australian broadcaster ABC. Featuring three of the first five Doctors, a new actor to replace the deceased William Hartnell, and unused footage to represent Tom Baker. This was a full-length, 90-minute film, the longest single episode of \"Doctor Who\" produced to date (the television movie ran slightly longer on broadcast where it included commercial breaks).\n\nIn 1993, for the franchise's 30th anniversary, another charity special, titled \"Dimensions in Time\" was produced for Children in Need, featuring all of the surviving actors who played the Doctor and a number of previous companions. It also featured a crossover with the soap opera \"EastEnders\", the action taking place in the latter's Albert Square location and around Greenwich. The special was one of several special 3D programmes the BBC produced at the time, using a 3D system that made use of the Pulfrich effect requiring glasses with one darkened lens; the picture would look normal to those viewers who watched without the glasses.\n\nIn 1999, another special, \"\", was made for Comic Relief and later released on VHS. An affectionate parody of the television series, it was split into four segments, mimicking the traditional serial format, complete with cliffhangers, and running down the same corridor several times when being chased (the version released on video was split into only two episodes). In the story, the Doctor (Rowan Atkinson) encounters both the Master (Jonathan Pryce) and the Daleks. During the special the Doctor is forced to regenerate several times, with his subsequent incarnations played by, in order, Richard E. Grant, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Grant and Joanna Lumley. The script was written by Steven Moffat, later to be head writer and executive producer to the revived series.\n\nSince the return of \"Doctor Who\" in 2005, the franchise has produced two original \"mini-episodes\" to support Children in Need. The first, aired in November 2005, was an which introduced David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. It was followed in November 2007 by \"Time Crash\", a 7-minute scene which featured the Tenth Doctor meeting the Fifth Doctor Peter Davison.\n\nA set of two mini-episodes, titled \"Space\" and \"Time\" respectively, were produced to support Comic Relief. They were aired during the Comic Relief 2011 event.\n\nDuring 2011 Children in Need, an exclusively filmed segment showed the Doctor addressing the viewer, attempting to persuade them to purchase items of his clothing, which were going up for auction for Children in Need. The 2012 edition of CiN featured the mini-episode \"The Great Detective\".\n\n\"Doctor Who\" has been satirised and spoofed on many occasions by comedians including Spike Milligan (a Dalek invades his bathroom — Milligan, naked, hurls a soap sponge at it) and Lenny Henry. Jon Culshaw frequently impersonates the Fourth Doctor in the BBC \"Dead Ringers\" series. \"Doctor Who\" fandom has also been lampooned on programs such as \"Saturday Night Live\", \"The Chaser's War on Everything\", \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", \"Family Guy\", \"American Dad!\", \"Futurama\", \"South Park\",\n\"Community\" as Inspector Spacetime, \"The Simpsons\" and \"The Big Bang Theory\". As part of the 50th anniversary programmes, former Fifth Doctor Peter Davison directed, wrote and co-starred in the parody \"The Five(ish) Doctors Reboot\", which also starred two other former Doctors, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, and cameo appearances from cast and crew involved in the programme, including showrunner Steven Moffat and Doctors Paul McGann, David Tennant and Matt Smith.\n\nThe Doctor in his fourth incarnation has been represented on several episodes of \"The Simpsons\" and Matt Groening's other animated series \"Futurama\".\n\nThere have also been many references to \"Doctor Who\" in popular culture and other science fiction, including \"\" (\"\") and \"Leverage\". In the Channel 4 series \"Queer as Folk\" (created by later \"Doctor Who\" executive producer Russell T. Davies), the character of Vince was portrayed as an avid \"Doctor Who\" fan, with references appearing many times throughout in the form of clips from the programme. In a similar manner, the character of Oliver on \"Coupling\" (created and written by current show runner Steven Moffat) is portrayed as a \"Doctor Who\" collector and enthusiast.\nReferences to \"Doctor Who\" have also appeared in the young adult fantasy novels \"Brisingr\" and \"High Wizardry\", the video game \"Rock Band\", the Adult Swim comedy show \"Robot Chicken\", the \"Family Guy\" episodes \"Blue Harvest\" and \"420\", and the game \"RuneScape\". It has also be referenced in \"Destroy All Humans! 2\", by civilians in the game's variation of England, and multiple times throughout the \"Ace Attorney\" series.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" has been a reference in several political cartoons, from a 1964 cartoon in the \"Daily Mail\" depicting Charles de Gaulle as a Dalek to a 2008 edition of \"This Modern World\" by Tom Tomorrow in which the Tenth Doctor informs an incredulous character from 2003 that the Democratic Party will nominate an African-American as its presidential candidate.\n\nThe word \"TARDIS\" is an entry in the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary and the iOS dictionary.\n\nThere have been various exhibitions of \"Doctor Who\" in the United Kingdom, including the now closed exhibitions at:\nThe exhibition closed down on the 9th of September 2017\n\nSince its beginnings, \"Doctor Who\" has generated hundreds of products related to the show, from toys and games to collectible picture cards and postage stamps. These include board games, card games, gamebooks, computer games, roleplaying games, action figures and a pinball game. Many games have been released that feature the Daleks, including Dalek computer games.\n\nThe earliest \"Doctor Who\"-related audio release was a 21-minute narrated abridgement of the First Doctor television story \"The Chase\" released in 1966. Ten years later, the first original Doctor Who audio was released on LP record; \"Doctor Who and the Pescatons\" featuring the Fourth Doctor. The first commercially available audiobook was an abridged reading of the Fourth Doctor story \"State of Decay\" in 1981. In 1988, during a hiatus in the television show, \"Slipback\", the first radio drama, was transmitted.\n\nSince 1999, Big Finish Productions has released several different series of Doctor Who audios on CD. The earliest of these featured the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Doctors, with Paul McGann's Eight Doctor joining the line in 2001. Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor began appearing for Big Finish in 2012. Along with the main range, adventures of the First, Second and Third Doctors have been produced in both limited cast and full cast formats, as well as audiobooks. The 2013 series \"\", produced as part of the series' 50th Anniversary celebrations, marked the first time Big Finish created stories (in this case audiobooks) featuring the Doctors from the revived show. Along with this, in May 2016 the Tenth Doctor, David Tennant, appeared alongside Catherine Tate in a collection of three audio adventures.\n\nIn addition to these main lines, both the BBC and Big Finish have produced original audio dramas and audiobooks based on spin-off material, such as \"Torchwood\" and \"The Sarah Jane Adventures\" series.\n\n\"Doctor Who\" books have been published from the mid-sixties through to the present day. From 1965 to 1991 the books published were primarily novelised adaptations of broadcast episodes; beginning in 1991 an extensive line of original fiction was launched, the Virgin New Adventures and Virgin Missing Adventures. Since the relaunch of the programme in 2005, a new range of novels have been published by BBC Books. Numerous non-fiction books about the series, including guidebooks and critical studies, have also been published, and a dedicated \"Doctor Who Magazine\" with newsstand circulation has been published regularly since 1979. This is published by Panini, as is the \"Doctor Who Adventures\" magazine for younger fans.\n\nSee also:\n\nNumerous \"Doctor Who\" video games have been created from the mid-80s through to the present day. One of the recent ones is a match-3 game released in November 2013 for iOS, Android, Amazon App Store and Facebook called \"\". It has been constantly updated since its release and features all of the Doctors as playable characters as well as over 100 companions.\n\nAnother video game instalment is LEGO Dimensions – in which Doctor Who is one of the many \"Level Packs\" in the game. At the moment, the pack contains the Twelfth Doctor (who can reincarnate into the others), K9, the TARDIS and a Victorian London adventure level area. The game and pack released in November 2015.\n\nAnother recent game is called \"Doctor Who Infinity\", which was released on Steam on 7 August 2018. It was nominated for \"Best Start-up\" at The Independent Game Developers' Association Awards 2018.\n\nSince the creation of the \"Doctor Who\" character by BBC Television in the early 1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about \"Doctor Who\", in different media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books, radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and stage performances. The BBC takes no position on the canonicity of any of such stories, and producers of the show have expressed distaste for the idea of canonicity.\n\nThe show has received recognition as one of Britain's finest television programmes, winning the 2006 British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Series and five consecutive (2005–2010) awards at the National Television Awards during Russell T Davies' tenure as executive producer. In 2011, Matt Smith became the first Doctor to be nominated for a BAFTA Television Award for Best Actor and in 2016, Michelle Gomez became the first female to receive a BAFTA nomination for the series, getting a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her work as Missy. In 2013, the Peabody Awards honoured \"Doctor Who\" with an Institutional Peabody \"for evolving with technology and the times like nothing else in the known television universe.\" The programme is listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the longest-running science fiction television show in the world, the \"most successful\" science fiction series of all time—based on its overall broadcast ratings, DVD and book sales, and iTunes traffic— and for the largest ever simulcast of a TV drama with its 50th anniversary special. During its original run, it was recognised for its imaginative stories, creative low-budget special effects, and pioneering use of electronic music (originally produced by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop).\n\nIn 1975, Season 11 of the series won a Writers' Guild of Great Britain award for Best Writing in a Children's Serial. In 1996, BBC television held the \"Auntie Awards\" as the culmination of their \"TV60\" series, celebrating 60 years of BBC television broadcasting, where \"Doctor Who\" was voted as the \"Best Popular Drama\" the corporation had ever produced, ahead of such ratings heavyweights as \"EastEnders\" and \"Casualty\". In 2000, \"Doctor Who\" was ranked third in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, produced by the British Film Institute and voted on by industry professionals. In 2005, the series came first in a survey by \"SFX\" magazine of \"The Greatest UK Science Fiction and Fantasy Television Series Ever\". Also, in the 100 Greatest Kids' TV shows (a Channel 4 countdown in 2001), the 1963–1989 run was placed at number eight.\n\nThe revived series has received recognition from critics and the public, across various awards ceremonies. It won five BAFTA TV Awards, including Best Drama Series, the highest-profile and most prestigious British television award for which the series has ever been nominated. It was very popular at the BAFTA Cymru Awards, with 25 wins overall including Best Drama Series (twice), Best Screenplay/Screenwriter (thrice) and Best Actor. It was also nominated for 7 Saturn Awards, winning the only Best International Series in the ceremony's history.

The winning episodes were \"The Empty Child\"/\"The Doctor Dances\" (2006), \"The Girl in the Fireplace\" (2007), \"Blink\" (2008), \"The Waters of Mars\" (2010), \"The Pandorica Opens\"/\"The Big Bang\" (2011), and \"The Doctor's Wife\" (2012). The 2016 Christmas special \"The Return of Doctor Mysterio\" is also a finalists for the 2017 Hugo Awards. Doctor Who star Matt Smith won Best Actor in the 2012 National Television awards alongside Karen Gillan who won Best Actress. \"Doctor Who\" has been nominated for over 200 awards and has won over a hundred of them.\n\nIn 2004 and 2007, \"Doctor Who\" was ranked #18 and #22 on TV Guide's Top Cult Shows Ever. In 2013, TV Guide ranked it as the #6 sci-fi show.\n\nAs a British series, the majority of its nominations and awards have been for national competitions such as the BAFTAs, but it has occasionally received nominations in mainstream American awards, most notably a nomination for \"Favorite Sci-Fi Show\" in the 2008 People's Choice Awards and the series has been nominated multiple times in the Spike Scream Awards, with Smith winning Best Science Fiction Actor in 2011. The Canadian Constellation Awards have also recognised the series.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}
{"id": "11315", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11315", "title": "Friends", "text": "Friends\n\nFriends is an American sitcom television series, created by David Crane and Marta Kauffman, which aired on NBC from September 22, 1994, to May 6, 2004, lasting ten seasons. With an ensemble cast starring Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, the show revolved around six friends in their 20s and 30s who lived in Manhattan, New York City. The series was produced by Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television. The original executive producers were Kevin S. Bright, Kauffman, and Crane.\n\nKauffman and Crane began developing \"Friends\" under the title \"Insomnia Cafe\" between November and December 1993. They presented the idea to Bright, and together they pitched a seven-page treatment of the show to NBC. After several script rewrites and changes, including title changes to \"Six of One\" and \"Friends Like Us\", the series was finally named \"Friends\".\n\nFilming of the show took place at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. All ten seasons of \"Friends\" ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings; it ultimately reached the number-one spot in its eighth season. The series finale aired on May 6, 2004, and was watched by around 52.5 million American viewers, making it the fifth most-watched series finale in television history, and the most-watched television episode of the 2000s decade.\n\n\"Friends\" received acclaim throughout its run, becoming one of the most popular television shows of all time. The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning the Outstanding Comedy Series award in 2002 for its eighth season. The show ranked no. 21 on \"TV Guide\"s 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time, and no. 7 on \"Empire\" magazine's The 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 1997, the episode \"The One with the Prom Video\" was ranked 100 on \"TV Guide\"s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time. In 2013, \"Friends\" ranked no. 24 on the Writers Guild of America's 101 Best Written TV Series of All Time, and no. 28 on \"TV Guide\"s 60 Best TV Series of All Time.\n\nIn West Village, Rachel Green, a sheltered but friendly woman, flees her wedding day and her rich yet unfulfilling life, and finds childhood friend Monica Geller, a tightly-wound but caring chef. After Rachel becomes a waitress at coffee house Central Perk, she and Monica become roommates at Monica's apartment located directly above Central Perk, and Rachel joins Monica's group of single people in their mid-20s: her previous roommate Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric, innocent masseuse; her neighbor across the hall Joey Tribbiani, a dim-witted yet loyal struggling actor and womanizer; Joey's roommate Chandler Bing, a sarcastic, self-deprecating IT manager; and her older brother and Chandler's college roommate Ross Geller, a sweet-natured but insecure paleontologist.\n\nEpisodes depict the friends' comedic and romantic adventures and career issues, such as Joey auditioning for roles or Rachel seeking jobs in the fashion industry. The six characters each have many dates and serious relationships, such as Monica with Richard Burke, and Ross with Emily Waltham. Ross and Rachel's intermittent relationship is the most often-recurring storyline; during the ten seasons of the show, they repeatedly date and break up. Ross briefly marries Emily. Ross and Rachel have a child together after a one-night stand, Chandler and Monica date and marry each other, and Phoebe marries Mike Hannigan. Other frequently recurring characters include Ross and Monica's parents Jack and Judy Geller from Long Island; Ross's ex-wife Carol Willick, their son Ben Geller as well as Carol's wife Susan Bunch; Central Perk barista Gunther; Chandler's ex-girlfriend Janice Goralnik; and Phoebe's twin sister Ursula.\n\n\nIn their original contracts for the first season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least paid cast member. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1 million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest-paid TV actresses of all time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit of a piece of the show's lucrative back-end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like Jerry Seinfeld and Bill Cosby.\n\nSeries creator David Crane wanted all six actors to be equally prominent, and the series was lauded as being \"the first true 'ensemble' show.\" The cast members made efforts to keep the ensemble format and not allow one member to dominate; they entered themselves in the same acting categories for awards, opted for collective salary negotiations, and asked to appear together on magazine cover photos in the first season. The cast members also became best friends off-screen, so much so that recurring guest star Tom Selleck reported that he sometimes felt left out.\n\nThe cast remained good friends after the series run, most notably Cox and Aniston, with Aniston being godmother to Cox and David Arquette's daughter, Coco. In the official farewell commemorative book \"Friends 'Til the End\", each separately acknowledged in interviews that the cast had become their family.\n\nThe first season introduces the six main characters: Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler, and Ross. Rachel arrives at Central Perk after leaving her fiancé Barry at the altar. She moves into an apartment with her high school friend Monica and takes up a waitressing job at Central Perk. Ross, who has had a crush on Rachel since high school, constantly attempts to declare his feelings for her. However, many obstacles stand in his way, including Rachel dating an Italian neighbour named Paolo, and the fact that he is expecting a baby with his lesbian ex-wife, Carol. She gives birth later in the season and names the child Ben. Joey is a bachelor and struggling actor. Phoebe is working as a masseuse; she is slightly crazy because her mother committed suicide when she was a child. However, the rest of the group loves her regardless. Chandler breaks up with his girlfriend, Janice (Maggie Wheeler), only to find himself reconnecting with her over the course of the series. Near the end of the season, Chandler accidentally reveals that Ross loves Rachel, who then realizes that she feels the same way. The season ends with Rachel waiting at the airport for Ross, who is returning from a trip.\n\nRachel greets Ross at the airport only to discover that he is dating Julie (Lauren Tom), someone he knew from graduate school. Rachel's attempts to tell Ross that she loves him initially mirror his failed attempts in the first season, but later there is friction between them when Rachel discovers a list of cons of dating her made by Ross after he breaks up with Julie. They eventually begin a relationship after Rachel watches an old home video and realizes the effort Ross made to stand in for her prom date who nearly stood her up. Monica is fired from her job as chef in the Iridium restaurant for accepting gifts against the company policy and as a result, her savings deteriorate to the point of her having to take an embarrassing job as a waitress at a 50s-style diner. Joey gets cast in a fictional version of the soap opera, \"Days of Our Lives\" as neurosurgeon Dr. Drake Ramoray, and soon moves out of his and Chandler's apartment, forcing Chandler to get a new roommate, Eddie (Adam Goldberg). However, Eddie turns out to be an annoying and mentally ill psychopath to Chandler, and Joey's character is killed off after he begins to claim that he writes many of his own lines, bringing him into conflict with the show's writers. With his new apartment being repossessed, Joey moves back in with Chandler, kicking Eddie out in the process. Chandler gets back together with Janice after they both unknowingly chat with each other online. Monica begins dating Richard (Tom Selleck), a recently divorced family friend 21 years her senior, but eventually breaks up with him when she realizes that Richard does not want kids.\n\nSeason 3 takes on a significantly greater serialized format. Chandler and Janice date for several episodes until Joey catches Janice kissing her soon-to-be ex-husband. Not wanting to destroy her family, Chandler urges Janice to go back to her husband, and becomes depressed over the breakup for several episodes. Rachel quits her job at Central Perk and begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain, and Ross becomes jealous of her colleague, Mark. Rachel decides to take a break from their relationship. Ross, hurt and drunk, sleeps with Chloe, \"the hot girl from the Xerox place,\" causing Rachel to break up with him. Chandler has a hard time dealing with their breakup because it reminds him of his parents' divorce. Although Phoebe initially believes she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), she becomes acquainted with her half-brother Frank Jr. (Giovanni Ribisi) and birth mother Phoebe Abbott (Teri Garr) over the course of the season. Joey begins a relationship with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), which ends when she receives acting opportunities in Los Angeles. Monica begins a relationship with millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau), despite not initially being attracted to him until they kiss. However, when Pete gets seriously hurt trying to become the Ultimate Fighting Champion, she breaks up with him. Phoebe sets Ross up on a date with her friend Bonnie (Christine Taylor), causing Rachel to get jealous. She tries to sabotage the relationship by coercing Bonnie to shave her head bald, and eventually admits to Ross that she still has feelings for him. The season closes with Ross being forced to choose between Rachel and Bonnie.\n\nIn the season 4 premiere, after Ross breaks up with Bonnie, he and Rachel briefly reconcile after Ross pretends to read a long letter that Rachel wrote for him. However, Ross continues to insist that the two were on a break when he slept with Chloe, so they break up again. Joey dates Kathy (Paget Brewster), a girl that Chandler has a crush on. Kathy and Chandler later kiss, which causes drama between Chandler and Joey. Joey only forgives Chandler and allows him to date Kathy after Chandler spends Thanksgiving in a box as punishment. Chandler's relationship with Kathy ends after discovering she cheated on him due to an argument. Phoebe loses her job as a masseuse after making out with one of her clients and she accompanies Monica who becomes a caterer for hire. They soon start a catering business together but Monica, after negatively reviewing a restaurant, Allesandro's, is offered the position of head chef. Despite initially being pressured by the wrath of her co-workers, Monica eventually asserts her dominance in the kitchen. Phoebe becomes a surrogate mother for her brother and his wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp). Monica and Rachel are forced to switch apartments with Joey and Chandler after losing a bet during a quiz game, but manage to switch back by bribing them with Knicks season tickets and a one-minute kiss (off-screen) between each other. After her boss dies, Rachel is demoted to personal shopping and meets and later dates a customer named Joshua (Tate Donovan). Ross begins dating an English woman named Emily (Helen Baxendale), and they quickly get engaged. Rachel struggles to cope and hastily suggests Joshua marry her, to which he rejects her. In the season finale, the group, apart from Phoebe and Rachel, travel to Ross and Emily's wedding in London. Chandler and Monica sleep together, and Rachel, realizing that she is still in love with Ross, rushes to London to stop Ross and Emily's wedding, but changes her mind when she sees them happy together. While saying his vows, Ross says Rachel's name at the altar, shocking his bride and the guests.\n\nRoss and Emily marry, but an angry Emily flees the reception. Rachel soon admits her love for Ross, but realizing how ridiculous this is, advises him to work on his marriage to Emily. She develops a crush on her neighbour, Danny, and they date briefly until she realizes that he is too close with his sister. The season features Monica and Chandler trying to keep their new relationship a secret from their friends. Phoebe gives birth to triplets in the show's 100th episode. She gives birth to a boy, Frank Jr. Jr., and two girls, Leslie and Chandler. After weeks of trying to contact her, Emily agrees to reconcile with Ross and move to New York if he breaks off all communication with Rachel. Ross agrees, but later attends a dinner with all his friends, Rachel included. Emily phones Ross, discovers Rachel is there, and realizes she does not trust him, ending their marriage. Ross takes out his anger at work, resulting in him being indefinitely suspended from the museum, and he moves in with Chandler and Joey until eventually getting a new apartment across the street from them. Rachel acquires a new job at Ralph Lauren. Phoebe begins a relationship with a police officer, Gary (Michael Rapaport), after finding his badge and using it as her own. Monica and Chandler go public with their relationship, to the surprise and delight of their friends. They decide to get married on a trip to Las Vegas, but change their plans after witnessing Ross and Rachel drunkenly stumbling out of the wedding chapel.\n\nIn the season 6 premiere, Ross and Rachel's marriage turns out to be a drunken mistake that neither of them remember until pointed out by their friends. Ross secretly tries to get an annulment because he does not want to have had three divorces. An annulment turns out to be impossible because of their history and they are forced to get divorced. After becoming annoyed by numerous signs that they should get married, Monica and Chandler decide to just move in together, causing Rachel to move in with Phoebe. Joey gets a new roommate, Janine (Elle Macpherson), and they realize they have feelings for each other and date briefly until Janine criticises Monica and Chandler. After they break up and Janine moves out, Joey struggles with paying his bills and takes up a job as a waiter at Central Perk. He soon lands a role on a cable television series called \"Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.\", where he stars alongside a robot. Ross gets a job lecturing at New York University and starts dating one of his students, Elizabeth (Alexandra Holden), despite it being against university rules. He seeks the approval of her father Paul (Bruce Willis), only for Rachel and Paul to start dating instead. Both relationships soon end, because Elizabeth is too immature for Ross and Paul is too emotional for Rachel. Phoebe and Rachel's apartment catches fire, and Rachel moves in with Joey, while Phoebe moves in with Chandler and Monica. During a visit to a museum which offers wedding services with a two-year waiting list, Monica is persuaded by Phoebe and Rachel to put her and Chandler's name on the sign-up sheet for fun. However, the museum leaves a message about an available booking while Chandler is home, causing Chandler to freak out; however, Monica does not know that Chandler is planning to ask Monica to marry him. During dinner, his planned proposal is halted when they encounter her ex-boyfriend Richard, who soon confesses his love for her and his desire to marry and have kids with her. She becomes upset about the situation, especially after Chandler claims he may never want to get married in order to hide his proposal plans, to the point where she visits Richard and complains to him. Chandler is led to believe that Monica has left him until he comes home to find their apartment decorated for her to propose to him. She is too emotional to finish, so Chandler proposes to her, which she accepts.\n\nThe seventh season mainly follows Monica and Chandler, who begin to plan their wedding and run into various problems. Joey's television series \"Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E\" is cancelled, but he is offered his job back on \"Days of Our Lives\"; the show is retconned with the revelation that Dr. Drake Ramoray's \"death\" merely landed him in a four-year-long coma; and the character is revived by getting another character's brain in a transplant. Phoebe's apartment is rebuilt, but it now has only one large bedroom instead of the original two, so Rachel decides to stay with Joey. Rachel receives a promotion at Ralph Lauren and impulsively hires an assistant, Tag Jones (Eddie Cahill), based on his looks despite being under-qualified. Tag learns that she has feelings for him at Thanksgiving and they start a relationship, keeping it hidden from their co-workers. However, on her 30th birthday Rachel breaks up with him when she realizes that their six-year age difference makes him too young and immature for her to be dating if she intends to follow her marriage schedule. Just prior to Monica and Chandler's wedding, after Chandler goes into hiding, Phoebe and Rachel find a positive pregnancy test in the bathroom of Monica and Chandler's apartment, assuming that it is Monica's. Ross and Phoebe are able to convince Chandler to return for the ceremony, but he briefly bolts out after finding out about the pregnancy test, only to return later considering the idea of fatherhood. Chandler and Monica get married but when he asks her about the pregnancy test, she denies that it is hers; unbeknown to them it turns out that the positive pregnancy test found in their bathroom belongs to Rachel.\n\nSeason 8 begins at Monica and Chandler's wedding reception. When Phoebe and Monica find out that Rachel is the one who had the positive pregnancy test, Rachel takes another pregnancy test, which Phoebe initially pretends is negative, in order to find out how Rachel feels about being pregnant. Rachel becomes sad when she thinks she is not pregnant, so Phoebe tells her the truth. Rachel, Phoebe, and Monica then rejoice in the bathroom. The season revolves around Rachel's pregnancy, especially once Ross is revealed to be the father. Rachel and Ross decide to have the baby but do not resume their romantic relationship; Ross soon begins going out with Monica's co-worker, Mona (Bonnie Somerville). Joey takes Rachel out on a date to comfort her due to her pregnancy but ends up developing romantic feelings for her. He struggles with his feelings and encourages Rachel to move in with Ross so he does not miss out on the pregnancy. This results in Mona breaking up with Ross when she finds out, and Joey tells Ross about his feelings for Rachel. Ross initially becomes angry but gives Joey his blessing. Joey tells Rachel that he loves her but she does not reciprocate his feelings; things between them become awkward for a while but they are able to remain friends. Rachel gives birth to baby Emma in the season finale. At the hospital, Ross's mother offers him an engagement ring because she wants him to marry Rachel. Ross does not intend to ask Rachel to marry him, but he takes the ring anyway and puts it in his jacket pocket. While waiting around in the hospital, Monica and Chandler decide to try for a baby. Meanwhile, in the post-delivery room, Joey picks up Ross's jacket while looking for some tissue. The ring falls to the floor. He kneels to pick it up and turns to Rachel, still on his knees and still holding the ring. Rachel accepts what she thinks is his proposal of marriage, while Ross is on his way to her room to ask her if she wants to resume their relationship.\n\nSeason nine begins with Ross and Rachel living together as roommates with their daughter Emma, after Joey and Rachel clear up the misunderstanding with the proposal. Monica and Chandler try to have a baby of their own but several obstacles occur: Chandler unknowingly agrees to travel to Tulsa for work; Monica originally intends to go with him but is offered a head chef job at a new restaurant, Javu, resulting in Chandler commuting back and forth between Tulsa and New York every week. After being apart from Monica during Christmas, Chandler soon quits his job and pursues a career in advertising. He starts at an unpaid internship at the agency, but is soon promoted to junior copywriter. Finally, Monica and Chandler find out that they are physically unable to conceive, and after considering surrogacy and sperm donation, decide to adopt instead. Phoebe begins dating Mike Hannigan (Paul Rudd) for most of the season until Mike tells her that he never wants to marry again. Phoebe soon begins dating her ex-boyfriend from season 1, David (Hank Azaria) and he plans on proposing to her, but when Mike proposes first, Phoebe rejects both proposals but gets back together with Mike, only needing the reassurance that they have a future together. Rachel, believing that her co-worker Gavin (Dermot Mulroney) is trying to steal her job while she is on maternity leave, returns to Ralph Lauren early. She discovers at her birthday party that Gavin has feelings for her and they kiss. However, they decide not to do anything about it due to her history with Ross; but Ross, having seen the kiss, tries to get back at Rachel by dating other women. After realizing that her situation with Ross is too weird, Rachel and Emma move in with Joey, and Rachel develops a crush on him, only to be disheartened when he starts dating Charlie (Aisha Tyler), a new paleontology professor at the university whom Ross has a crush on. The group travels to Barbados in the finale to hear Ross give a keynote speech at a paleontology conference. Joey and Charlie break up upon realizing they have nothing in common, and Joey realizes that Rachel has feelings for him, but says they cannot pursue this because of Ross. However, upon seeing Ross and Charlie kiss each other, he goes to Rachel's hotel room, and the finale ends with the two of them kissing.\n\nThe tenth season brings several long-running storylines to a close. Joey and Rachel try to contend with Ross's feelings about their relationship and decide it would be best to remain friends. Charlie breaks up with Ross to get back together with her ex-boyfriend. Phoebe and Mike get married mid-season outside the Central Perk coffee house. Monica and Chandler apply to adopt a child and are chosen by Erica (Anna Faris). Following this, Monica and Chandler prepare to move to a house in the suburbs to raise their family, saddening everyone, including Joey who becomes upset with the changes in his life. In the series finale, Erica gives birth to fraternal twins, to Monica and Chandler's surprise. Rachel gets fired from her job at Ralph Lauren when her boss catches her secretly interviewing for a new job a Gucci. She encounters her former Bloomingdale co-worker Mark, who offers her a new job at Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross tries to get Rachel her job back by secretly meeting with her boss but eventually gives up after realizing that the Paris job is her dream job. When Rachel says a tearful goodbye to everyone but Ross at her going away party, a hurt and angry Ross confronts Rachel, and they end up sleeping together. Rachel leaves, and Ross — who now realizes he is in love with her — chases her to the airport. When he reaches her, Rachel realizes she loves him too, and gets off the plane at the last minute to reunite with him. The series ends with all the friends, plus Monica and Chandler's new babies, leaving the apartment together for a final cup of coffee at Central Perk. The show ends first with a shot of the keys to Monica and Chandler's apartment, on the counter table, and then with a shot of the apartment's purple door.\n\nDavid Crane and Marta Kauffman began developing three new television pilots that would premiere in 1994 after their sitcom \"Family Album\" was cancelled by CBS in 1993. Kauffman and Crane decided to pitch the series about \"six people in their 20s making their way in Manhattan\" to NBC since they thought it would fit best there. Crane and Kauffman presented the idea to their production partner Kevin Bright, who had served as executive producer on their HBO series \"Dream On\". The idea for the series was conceived when Crane and Kauffman began thinking about the time when they had finished college and started living by themselves in New York; Kauffman believed they were looking at a time when the future was \"more of a question mark.\" They found the concept to be interesting, as they believed \"everybody knows that feeling\", and because it was also how they felt about their own lives at the time. The team titled the series \"Insomnia Cafe\" and pitched the idea as a seven-page treatment to NBC in December 1993.\n\nAt the same time, Warren Littlefield, the then-president of NBC Entertainment, was seeking a comedy involving young people living together and sharing expenses. Littlefield wanted the group to share memorable periods of their lives with friends, who had become \"new, surrogate family members.\" However, Littlefield found difficulty in bringing the concept to life and found the scripts developed by NBC to be terrible. When Kauffman, Crane and Bright pitched \"Insomnia Cafe\", Littlefield was impressed that they knew who their characters were. NBC bought the idea as a put pilot, meaning they risked financial penalties if the pilot was not filmed. Kauffman and Crane took three days to write the pilot script for a show they titled \"Friends Like Us.\" Littlefield wanted the series to \"represent Generation X and explore a new kind of tribal bonding\", but the rest disagreed. Crane argued that it was not a series for one generation, and wanted to produce a series that everyone would enjoy watching. NBC liked the script and ordered the series. They changed the title to \"Six of One\", mainly because they felt \"Friends Like Us\" was too similar to the ABC sitcom \"These Friends of Mine\".\n\nOnce it became apparent that the series was a favored project at NBC, Littlefield reported that he was getting calls from every agent in town, wanting their client to be a part of the series. Auditions for the lead roles took place in New York and Los Angeles. The casting director shortlisted 1,000 actors who had applied for each role down to 75. Those who received a callback read in front of Crane, Kauffman and Bright. At the end of March, the number of potential actors had been reduced to three or four for each part, and were asked to read for Les Moonves, then-president of Warner Bros. Television.\n\nHaving worked with David Schwimmer in the past, the series creators wrote the character of Ross with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast. Cox wanted to play the role of Monica because she liked the \"strong\" character, but the producers had her in mind to play Rachel because of her \"cheery, upbeat energy\", which was not how they envisioned Monica; after Cox's audition, though, Kauffman agreed with Cox, and she got the role. When Matt LeBlanc auditioned for Joey, he put a \"different spin\" on the character. He played Joey more simple-minded than intended and gave the character heart. Although Crane and Kauffman did not want LeBlanc for the role at the time, they were told by the network to cast him. Jennifer Aniston, Matthew Perry and Lisa Kudrow were cast based on their auditions.\n\nMore changes occurred to the series's storylines during the casting process. The writers found that they had to adjust the characters they had written to suit the actors, and the discovery process of the characters occurred throughout the first season. Kauffman acknowledged that Joey's character became \"this whole new being\", and that \"it wasn't until we did the first Thanksgiving episode that we realized how much fun Monica's neuroses are.\"\n\nIn the weeks after NBC's pick up of \"Friends\", Crane, Kauffman and Bright reviewed sent-in scripts that writers had originally prepared for other series, mainly unproduced \"Seinfeld\" episodes. Kauffman and Crane hired a team of seven young writers because \"When you're 40, you can't do it anymore. The networks and studios are looking for young people coming in out of college.\" The creators felt that using six equal characters, rather than emphasizing one or two, would allow for \"myriad storylines and give the show legs.\" The majority of the storyline ideas came from the writers, although the actors added ideas. Although the writers originally planned the big love story to be between Joey and Monica, the idea of a romantic interest between Ross and Rachel emerged during the period when Kauffman and Crane wrote the pilot script.\n\nDuring the production of the pilot, NBC requested that the script be changed to feature one dominant storyline and several minor ones, but the writers refused, wanting to keep three storylines of equal weight. NBC also wanted the writers to include an older character to balance out the young ones. Crane and Kauffman were forced to comply and wrote a draft of an early episode that featured \"Pat the Cop.\" who would be used to provide advice to the other characters. Crane found the storyline to be terrible, and Kauffman joked, \"You know the book, \"Pat the Bunny\"? We had Pat the Cop.\" NBC eventually relented and dropped the idea.\n\nEach summer, the producers would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. The hardest episodes to write were always \"the first one and the last one of each season.\" Unlike other storylines, the idea for a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.\n\nThe episode title format—\"The One ...\"—was created when the producers realized that the episode titles would not be featured in the opening credits, and therefore would be unknown to most of the audience. Episode titles officially begin with \"The One ...\" except the title of the pilot episode and the series finale \"The Last One.\"\n\nThe first season was shot on Stage 5 at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California. NBC executives had worried that the coffee house setting was too hip and asked for the series to be set in a diner, but, eventually consented to the coffee house concept. The opening title sequence was filmed in a fountain at the Warner Bros. Ranch at 4:00 am, while it was particularly cold for a Burbank morning. At the beginning of the second season, production moved to the larger Stage 24, which was renamed \"The Friends Stage\" after the series finale. Filming for the series began during the summer of 1994 in front of a live audience, who were given a summary of the series to familiarize themselves with the six main characters; a hired comedian entertained the studio audience between takes. Each 22-minute episode took six hours to film—twice the length of most sitcom tapings—mainly due to the several retakes and rewrites of the script.\n\nAlthough the producers always wanted to find the right stories to take advantage of being on location, \"Friends\" was never shot in New York. Bright felt that filming outside the studio made episodes less funny, even when shooting on the lot outside, and that the live audience was an integral part of the series. When the series was criticized for incorrectly depicting New York, with the financially struggling group of friends being able to afford huge apartments, Bright noted that the set had to be big enough for the cameras, lighting, and \"for the audience to be able to see what's going on\"; the apartments also needed to provide a place for the actors to execute the funny scripts. The fourth-season finale was shot on location in London because the producers were aware of the series's popularity in the UK. The scenes were shot in a studio with three audiences each made up of 500 people. These were the show's largest audiences throughout its run. The fifth-season finale, set in Las Vegas, was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios, although Bright met people who thought it was filmed on location.\n\nThe series's creators completed the first draft of the hour-long finale in January 2004, four months before its original airing. Crane, Kauffman and Bright watched the finales of other sitcoms to prepare the episode's outline, paying attention to what worked and what did not. They liked the ones that stayed true to the series, citing the finale of \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" as the gold standard. Crane, Kauffman, and Bright had difficulty writing the finale. They did not want to do \"something high concept, or take the show out of the show.\" The most critical parts of the finale were shot without an audience, and with a minimum number of crew members. The main cast enjoyed the finale and were confident that the fans would react similarly:\n\nNBC heavily promoted the series finale, which was preceded by weeks of media hype. Local NBC affiliates organized viewing parties around the U.S., including an event at Universal CityWalk featuring a special broadcast of the finale on an outdoor Astrovision screen. The finale was the subject of two episodes of \"Dateline NBC\", one of which ran for two hours. A one-hour retrospective of clips from previous episodes was shown before to the airing of the episode. Following the finale, \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" was filmed on the set of the \"Friends\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Central Perk coffee house, which featured the series's cast as guests. The advertising rates for the finale averaged $2 million for 30 seconds of commercial time, breaking the record held by the \"Seinfeld\" finale at $1.7 million.\n\nIn the U.S., 52.5 million viewers watched the finale on May 6, 2004, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast since the \"Seinfeld\" finale in 1998. Although not the most-watched episode of the series, the finale was the fourth most-watched series finale in television history, only behind the finales of \"M*A*S*H\", \"Cheers\" and \"Seinfeld\", which were respectively watched by 105, 80.4 and 76.2 million viewers. The retrospective episode was watched by fewer than 36 million viewers, and the finale was the second most-watched television broadcast of the year in the United States, only behind the Super Bowl. Following the finales of \"Friends\" and \"Frasier\", media critics speculated about the fate of the sitcom genre. Expressed opinions varied between a signalling of the end of the sitcom genre, a small decline in the large history of the genre, and a general reduction of scripted television in favor of reality shows.\n\nEarly reviews of the series were mixed; and it holds a Metacritic score of 59 out of 100, based on 20 sampled reviews, indicating \"mixed to average reviews.\" Tom Feran of \"The Plain Dealer\" wrote that the series traded \"vaguely and less successfully on the hanging-out style of \"Seinfeld\"\", while Ann Hodges of the \"Houston Chronicle\" called it \"the new \"Seinfeld\" wannabe, but it will never be as funny as \"Seinfeld\".\" In the \"Los Angeles Daily News\", Ray Richmond named the series as \"one of the brighter comedies of the new season\", and the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it \"flat-out the best comedy series of the new season.\"\n\nThe \"Chicago Sun-Times\" Ginny Holbert found Joey and Rachel's characteristics to be underdeveloped, while Richmond commended the cast as a \"likeable, youth ensemble\" with \"good chemistry.\" Robert Bianco of \"USA Today\" was complimentary of Schwimmer, calling him \"terrific.\" He also praised the female leads, but was concerned that Perry's role as Chandler was \"undefined\" and that LeBlanc was \"relying too much on the same brain-dead stud routine that was already tired the last two times he tried it.\" The authors of \"Friends Like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends\" thought that the cast was \"trying just a little too hard\", in particular, Perry and Schwimmer.\n\nAs the series progressed, reviews became more positive, and \"Friends\" became one of the most popular sitcoms of its time. It is now often ranked among the all-time best TV shows. Critics commended the series for having consistently sharp writing and for the chemistry between the main actors. Noel Holston of \"Newsday\", who had dismissed the pilot as a \"so-so \"Seinfeld\" wannabe\" in 1994, repudiated his earlier review after rewatching the episode and felt like writing an apology to the writers. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com thought that the series \"hit its stride\" in the second season. Havrilesky found the character-specific jokes and situations \"could reliably make you laugh out loud a few times each episode\", and the quality of writing allowed the stories to be \"original and innovative.\" Bill Carter of \"The New York Times\" called the eighth season a \"truly stunning comeback.\" Carter found that by \"generating new hot storylines and high-decibel laughs\", the series made its way \"back into the hearts of its fans.\" However, Liane Bonin of \"Entertainment Weekly\" felt that the direction of the ninth season was a \"disappointing buzzkill\", criticizing it for the non-stop celebrity guest spots and going into jump the shark territory. Although disappointed with the season, Bonin noted that \"the writing [was] still sharp.\" Havrilesky thought that the tenth season was \"alarmingly awful, far worse than you would ever imagine a show that was once so good could be.\" \"Friends\" was featured on \"Time\"s list of \"The 100 Best TV Shows of All-Time\", saying, \"the well-hidden secret of this show was that it called itself \"Friends\", and was really about family.\"\n\nReviews of the series finale were mixed. \"USA Today\"s Robert Bianco described the finale as entertaining and satisfying and praised it for deftly mixing emotion and humor while highlighting each of the stars. Sarah Rodman of the \"Boston Herald\" praised Aniston and Schwimmer for their acting, but felt that their characters' reunion was \"a bit too neat, even if it was what most of the show's legions of fans wanted.\" Roger Catlin of the \"Hartford Courant\" felt that newcomers to the series would be \"surprised at how laughless the affair could be, and how nearly every strained gag depends on the sheer stupidity of its characters.\" Ken Parish Perkins, writing for \"Fort Worth Star-Telegram\", pointed out that the finale was \"more touching than comical, more satisfying in terms of closure than knee-slappingly funny.\"\nTo maintain the series's ensemble format, the main cast members decided to enter themselves in the same acting categories for awards. Beginning with the series's eighth season, the actors decided to submit themselves in the lead actor balloting, rather than in the supporting actor fields. The series was nominated for 62 Primetime Emmy Awards, winning six. Aniston and Kudrow are the only main cast members to win an Emmy, while Cox is the only actor not to be nominated. The series won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series in 2002, receiving nominations in 1995, 1996, 1999, 2000, and 2003. The series also won an American Comedy Award, one GLAAD Media Award, one Golden Globe Award, three Logie Awards, six People's Choice Awards, one Satellite Award, and one Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nThe table below shows the ratings of \"Friends\" in the United States, where it consistently ranked within the top ten of the final television season ratings. \"Rank\" refers to how well \"Friends\" rated compared to other television series that aired during primetime hours of the corresponding television season. It is shown in relation to the total number of series airing on the then-six major English-language networks in a given season. \"Viewers\" refers to the average number of viewers for all original episodes, broadcast during the television season in the series's regular timeslot. The \"season premiere\" is the date that the first episode of the season aired, and the \"season finale\" is the date that the final episode of the season aired. So far, \"Friends\" has been the last sitcom to reach the 1 spot on television, as its successors were \"\", \"American Idol\", \"NBC Sunday Night Football\", and \"NCIS\". Following the September 11 attacks, ratings increased 17% over the previous season.\n\nBecause of syndication revenue, \"Friends\" continues to generate approximately $1 billion each year for Warner Bros. That translates into about $20 million in annual residuals each for Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer, who each get 2% of syndication income for \"Friends\".\n\nAll episodes became available on Netflix on January 1, 2015, introducing teenagers to the show. UK \"Friends\" reruns' ratings in 2015 increased by more than 10% annually. reruns' US weekly audience, not including streaming, of 16 million would make it a hit on network television were the show still being produced. In the US the series has a syndication deal through multiple networks including Nick at Nite, TBS, and it also aired on Paramount Network through 2019. However, in July 2019, it was announced that from the beginning of 2020, \"Friends\" will not be available on Netflix in the US and instead will be shown on WarnerMedia's video-streaming service, HBO Max, which is currently scheduled to launch in late spring 2020 (the series remains on Netflix in several other markets). In the interim, in the United States, the only way to stream the show is through the TBS app and website which have a limited number of episodes.\n\nAlthough the producers thought of \"Friends\" as \"only a TV show\", psychologists investigated the cultural impact of \"Friends\" during the series's run. Aniston's hairstyle was nicknamed \"The Rachel\" and copied around the world. Joey's catchphrase, \"How \"you\" doin'?\", became a popular part of Western English slang, often used as a pick-up line or when greeting friends. The series also influenced the English language, according to a study by the University of Toronto that found that the characters used the emphasized word \"so\" to modify adjectives more often than any other intensifier. Although the preference had already made its way into the American vernacular, usage on the series may have accelerated the change. Chandler's habit of ending a sentence unfinished for sarcasm also influenced viewers' speech.\n\n\"Friends\" has also been credited in helping non-English speaking students to learn the language. A 2012 poll by Kaplan International English Colleges found that more than a quarter (26%) of its students cited the sitcom as the best show for helping them improve their English. Notable individuals who have also said that the sitcom helped them learn English include Liverpool F.C. manager Jürgen Klopp, BTS member RM and Belgian professional golfer Thomas Pieters.\n\n\"Friends\" is parodied in the twelfth season \"Murder, She Wrote\" episode \"Murder Among Friends.\" In the episode, amateur sleuth Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) investigates the murder of a writer for \"Buds\", a fictional television series about the daily lives of a group of city friends. The episode was devised after CBS moved \"Murder, She Wrote\" from its regular Sunday night timeslot to a Thursday night timeslot directly opposite \"Friends\" on NBC; Angela Lansbury was quoted by Bruce Lansbury, her brother and \"Murder, She Wrote\"s supervising producer, as having \"a bit of an attitude\" about the move to Thursday, but he saw the plot as \"a friendly setup, no mean-spiritedness.\" Jerry Ludwig, the writer of the episode, researched the \"flavor\" of \"Buds\" by watching episodes of \"Friends\".\n\nThe Central Perk coffee house, one of the principal settings of the series, is part of the Warner Bros. Studio Tour Hollywood. People sometimes propose marriage on the couch, and many tourists cry when they sit on it. The coffee house has inspired various imitations worldwide. In 2006, Iranian businessman Mojtaba Asadian started a Central Perk franchise, registering the name in 32 countries. The decor of the coffee houses is inspired by \"Friends\", featuring replica couches, counters, neon signage and bricks. The coffee houses also contain paintings of the various characters from the series, and televisions playing \"Friends\" episodes. James Michael Tyler, who plays the Central Perk manager in the series, Gunther, attended the grand opening of the Dubai cafe, where he worked as a waiter. Central Perk was rebuilt as part of a museum exhibit at Warner Bros. Studios and was shown on \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" in October 2008.\n\nJennifer Aniston visited the set for the first time since the series finale in 2004. From September 24 to October 7, 2009, a Central Perk replica was based at Broadwick Street, Soho, London. The coffee house sold real coffee to customers and featured a display of \"Friends\" memorabilia and props, such as the Geller Cup from the season three episode \"The One with the Football.\" In Beijing, business owner Du Xin opened a coffee shop named Central Perk in March 2010.\n\nIn India, there are six \"Friends\"-themed cafes, located in Chandigarh (named Central Perk); Kolkata; and West Bengal (named F.R.I.E.N.D.S. Cafe), which features many icons from the original T.V. series, including Chandler and Joey's ugly dog statue, the orange sofa, the purple door of Monica and Rachel's apartment, and Phoebe's pink bicycle. The other three cafes are located in Delhi, Gurgaon; Bhubaneswar, Odisha; and Pune, Maharashtra. There are two \"Friends\" themed cafes in Pakistan as wellone in Lahore, Punjab known as \"Friends Cafe\" and the other in Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa called \"Central Perk\". Both of those cafes have an iconic couch, a guitar and foosball table, quotes from the show on the walls and even episode reruns on a projector. They're also planning to have their own Gunther at the bar. In 2016, a Central Perk replica was opened in Outram, Singapore. It is the only Central Perk that has been given the intellectual property rights by Warner Bros. outside of the United States. The cafe also includes feature walls, replicating the walls of the main characters's apartments and memorabilia and props used on the show. In August 2019, it was announced that a Central Perk Lego set would be launched to mark the show's 25 anniversary.\n\n\"Friends\" has also developed an alternative family lifestyle by representing young people that live unconventional domestic lives. It presents the idea that \"all you need is good friends\" and can construct families through choice. The audience is able to identify with the program through the troubles seen on weekly episodes. It portrays a new way of living life and developing relationships which are not normally seen in conventional society. According to a pop-culture expert at the University at Buffalo, \"Friends\" is \"one of those rare shows that marked a change in American culture.\" The images of youth and the roles they portray are better defined and represent a lifestyle that centres around creating and sustaining relationships between friends running their own lives and seeking help from each other.\n\n\"Vox\" stated that \"Friends\" impacted the creation of other conflictless \"hangout sitcoms\", with groups of adult friends who are funny and have similar character traits. One example of this is \"How I Met Your Mother\", which \"The Guardian\"s TV and radio blog notes also shares its setting with \"Friends\", Manhattan. Other examples include \"The Big Bang Theory\", \"New Girl\", and \"Happy Endings\".\n\nReaders of \"TV Guide\" voted the cast of \"Friends\" their Best Comedy cast of all time, ranking at 29% of the votes, beating \"Seinfeld\", which registered 18%. A poll undertaken by \"60 Minutes\" and \"Vanity Fair\" named \"Friends\" the third greatest sitcom of all time. In 2014, the series was ranked by \"Mundo Estranho\" the Best TV Series of All Time. A 2015 \"Hollywood Reporter\" survey of 2,800 actors, producers, directors, and other industry people named \"Friends\" as their #1 favorite show.\n\nOn November 12, 2019, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" announced that Warner Bros TV is developing a Friends reunion for HBO Max that would feature the whole cast and creators returning. The reunion is expected to be released in early 2020.\n\nAfter the produced pilot lived up to NBC's hopes, the series premiered with the name \"Friends\" on September 22, 1994, in the coveted Thursday 8:30 p.m. time slot. The pilot aired between \"Mad About You\" and \"Seinfeld\", and was watched by almost 22 million American viewers. The series was a huge success throughout its run and was a staple of NBC's Thursday night line-up, dubbed by the network as Must See TV. When Crane told reporters in 2001 that the ninth season was a possibility, critics believed that he was posturing and that at least two of the cast members would not sign on for another season. When it was confirmed that \"Friends\" would return for a ninth season, the news was mainly about the amount of money—$7 million per episode—that it took to bring the series back for another season.\n\nAfter year-long expectations that the ninth season would be the series's last, NBC signed a deal in late December 2002 to bring the series back for a final tenth season. The series's creative team did not want to extend negotiations into the next year and wanted to start writing the rest of the ninth-season episodes and a potential series finale. NBC agreed to pay $10 million to Warner Bros. for the production of each tenth-season episode, the highest price in television history for a 30-minute series. Although NBC was unable to bring in enough advertising revenue from commercials to cover the costs, the series was integral to the Thursday night schedule, which brought high ratings and profits to the other television series. The cast demanded that the tenth season be reduced from the usual 24 episodes to 18 episodes to allow them to work on outside projects.\n\nIn fall 2001, Warner Bros. Domestic Cable made a deal with sister network TBS (both are owned by Time Warner) to air the series in rerun syndication. Warner Bros. Domestic Cable announced that it had sold additional cable rights to \"Friends\" to Nick at Nite which began airing in the fall of 2011 (unlike the TBS and broadcast syndication airings, Nick at Nite broadcasts of the series, which began airing as part of a seven-night launch marathon on September 5, 2011, replace the end credit tag scenes with marginalized credits featuring promotions for the series and other Nick at Nite programs). Warner Bros. was expected to make $200 million in license fees and advertising from the deal. Nick at Nite paid $500,000 per episode to air the episodes after 6 p.m. ET for six years through fall 2017. In syndication until 2005, \"Friends\" had earned $4 million per episode in cash license fees for a total of $944 million.\n\nComedy Central began airing reruns of \"Friends\" on October 12, 2019.\n\n\"Friends\" premiered in the UK in April 1995, with Season 1 broadcasting until September on Channel 4 at 9:30 PM on Friday nights, and immediately became very popular, with the theme song by the Rembrandts hitting number 3 in the UK singles charts in September 1995. It had since aired on different channels in the UK in their original, unedited international versions prior to their being re-edited for US broadcast and syndication. These versions, with additional footage not seen domestically, have aired on such stations as Channel 4, Sky1, E4, and Comedy Central UK. On September 4, 2011, \"Friends\" officially ended on E4 after the channel re-ran the series since 2004. Comedy Central took over the rights to air the program from October 2011. Since 2018 Channel 5 started airing the program. In the Republic of Ireland, each season of the show made its European debut on RTÉ2. After 2004 RTÉ2 began to repeat the series from the start before moving over to TV3 and its digital channel 3e in 2010. , repeats of the show have returned to RTÉ2 while also broadcasting on Comedy Central Ireland.\n\nSeries 10's finale in the UK, broadcast on May 28, 2004, was on Channel 4. It was broadcast from 9pm to 10pm and attracted \"Friends\"' largest UK audiences. It attracted almost 10 million viewers, and is currently standing at Number 10 in Channel 4's most-watched shows. \"Big Brother\" was moved to 10pm, which \"Friends\" had beaten. \"Friends\" got 9.6 million viewers at 9pm, while \"Big Brother 5\"s launch attracted 7.2 million viewers at 10pm, which is the most-watched premiere on UK TV ever. However, on January 3, 2007, \"Celebrity Big Brother 5\"s launch was watched by 7.3 million viewers, and its eviction on January 19, 2007 was watched by 8.7 million viewers.\n\n\"Friends\" has aired in Australia on the Seven Network (season 1 only), Nine Network (season 2–10), Network Ten (2007–09, repeats), on GEM (a sub-channel of the Nine Network), and on pay TV channel TV Hits formerly aired on Arena, 111 Hits. The show is broadcast on TV2 in New Zealand.\n\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast on Global. In later years, it was syndicated on several of its cable sibling networks, including Slice, DTour, and TVTropolis, its previous incarnation.\n\nIn India, the show is broadcast by Comedy Central at various times. It is the most-watched English language show in the country.\n\nIn the Philippines, the show was originally aired on ABC-5 from 1996 to 2005 and ETC from 2005 to 2014.\n\nIn Greece, the show was broadcast on Star Channel. In Cyprus, \"Friends\" aired on CyBC 2 while reruns air on TVOne.\n\nBeginning on March 5, 2012, high definition versions of all 236 \"Friends\" episodes were made available to local broadcast stations, starting with the pilot episode. For the remastered episodes, Warner Bros. restored previously cropped images on the left and right sides of the screen, using the original 35 mm film source, to use the entire widescreen frame. However, because the show was not originally filmed for widescreen, but rather filmed in 4-perf format and protected for 4:3, some cropping problems arise in some shots where information from the top and bottom of the frame is removed, and some expanded shots reveal unintentional artifacts, including set edges, boom mics and body doubles replacing some of the main cast. In early versions of the HD remasters, there were also a few shots, including chroma effects shots, which were sourced from standard-definition 480i videotape sources, as not all of the footage had been located in time for the remaster; the original film sources for these shots were later rescanned for later broadcast and release. These masters had been airing in New Zealand on TV2 since January 2011. Netflix added all ten seasons of \"Friends\" in high definition to their streaming service in the United States on January 1, 2015.\n\nIn October 2014, Warner Bros. chairman and chief executive officer, Kevin Tsujihara, announced that the company had licensed the North American streaming rights of all ten seasons of \"Friends\" to Netflix, in a deal said to be worth around $500,000 an episode, or about $120 million in total. The show became available on Netflix from January 1, 2015. The Netflix airings are the versions aired on NBC rather than the longer international versions, as discussed below. The series left Netflix on January 1, 2020, as it will begin streaming on HBO Max in May 2020.\n\nAll ten seasons have been released on DVD individually and as a box set. Each Region 1 season release contains special features and are presented in their aforementioned original international broadcast versions, although Region 2 releases are as originally aired domestically. For the first season, each episode is updated with color correction and sound enhancement. A wide range of \"Friends\" merchandise has been produced by various companies. In September 1995, WEA Records released the first album of music from \"Friends\", the \"Friends Original TV Soundtrack\", containing music featured in previous and future episodes. The soundtrack debuted on the \"Billboard\" 200 at number 46, and sold 500,000 copies in November 1995. In 1999, a second soundtrack album entitled \"Friends Again\" was released. Other merchandise includes a \"Friends\" version of the DVD game \"Scene It?\", and a quiz video game for PlayStation 2 and PC entitled \"Friends: The One with All the Trivia\". On September 28, 2009, a box set was released in the UK celebrating the series's 15th anniversary. The box set contained extended episodes, an episode guide, and original special features.\n\nWarner Home Video released a complete series collection on Blu-ray on November 13, 2012. The collection does not feature the extra deleted scenes and jokes that were included on prior DVD releases, and are therefore presented in their NBC broadcast versions.\n\nIn Australia, the original released DVDs were released were fold out box sets which contained three discs and released as follows: Season 1 and Season 2 on March 13, 2002, Season 3 and Season 4 on July 9, 2002, Season 5, 6 and 7 on July 29, 2002, Season 8 on March 18, 2003, Season 9 on February 11, 2004 and Season 10 on November 24, 2004. Repackaged sets, slimmed into regular DVD cases also containing three discs were released from 2003 to 2004. Collector's Edition sets were released from September 9, 2003 through to February 1, 2006, these sets contains 4 discs, in fat DVD cases, with extra bonus material. On October 4, 2006, the individual seasons were repackaged into regular DVD case sets and marked as \"Including Brand New Bonus Disc\". Once again each individual season were repackaged with new artwork on March 31, 2010. The first complete series boxset on DVD was released around 2004 or 2005, this was titled 'The One With All Ten Seasons\" and the packaging was a black box with a lift up lid and contains exclusive packaging for all ten seasons. The second complete series boxset was released August 21, 2013 and was a red box which contained the 2010 individual season sets inside. On October 1, 2014 was the 20th Anniversary boxset, this was a white box and contained the same 2010 individual releases inside. On October 7, 2015, another boxset was released 'The One With All Ten Seasons\", the same name used on the original boxset, however this time slimmed down and contains the 2010 individual releases inside. The outer box is open on insert side for the cases to slide in and out, more of a budget release. In 2016, a repackaged 'The Complete Series' Blu-Ray boxset was issued, contenting the same 10 individual season in the original set, however the box is more cut down and is opened on one side, and also does not include the book that contained the episode guide.\n\nAfter the series finale in 2004, LeBlanc signed on for the spin-off series, \"Joey\", following Joey's move to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Kauffman and Crane were not interested in the spin-off, although Bright agreed to executive produce the series with Scott Silveri and Shana Goldberg-Meehan. NBC heavily promoted \"Joey\" and gave it \"Friends\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> Thursday 8:00 pm timeslot. The pilot was watched by 18.6 million American viewers, but ratings continually decreased throughout the series's two seasons, averaging 10.2 million viewers in the first season and 7.1 million in the second. The final broadcast episode on March 7, 2006, was watched by 7.09 million viewers; NBC cancelled the series on May 15, 2006, after two seasons, leaving eight episodes unaired. Bright blamed the collaboration between NBC executives, the studio and other producers for quickly ruining the series:\n\nArticles concerning the cultural influence of the program:\n\n"}

It is listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the longest-running drama in television in American history, broadcast on CBS for 57 years from June 30, 1952, until September 18, 2009, overlapping a 19-year broadcast on radio from 1937 to 1956. With 72 years of radio and television runs, \"Guiding Light\" is the longest running soap opera, ahead of \"General Hospital\", and is the fifth-longest running program in all of broadcast history; only the American country music radio program \"Grand Ole Opry\" (first broadcast in 1925), the BBC religious program \"The Daily Service\" (1928), the CBS religious program \"Music and the Spoken Word\" (1929), and the Norwegian children's radio program \"Lørdagsbarnetimen\" (1924-2010) have been on the air longer.\n\n\"Guiding Light\" was created by Irna Phillips, and began as an NBC Radio serial on January 25, 1937. On June 2, 1947, the series was transferred to CBS Radio, before starting on June 30, 1952, on CBS Television. It continued to be broadcast concomitantly on radio until June 29, 1956. The series was expanded from 15 minutes to a half-hour during 1968 (and also switched from broadcasting live to pre-taping around this same time), and then to a full hour on November 7, 1977. The series broadcast its 15,000th CBS episode on September 6, 2006.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, CBS announced the cancellation of \"Guiding Light\" after a run of 72 years (15 on radio and 57 on television) due to low ratings. The show taped its final scenes on August 11, 2009, and its final episode on the network aired on September 18, 2009. On October 5, 2009, CBS replaced \"Guiding Light\" with an hour-long revival of \"Let's Make a Deal\", hosted by Wayne Brady.\n\n\"Guiding Light\" has had a number of plot sequences during the series' long history, on both radio and television. These plot sequences include complex storylines, and different writers and casting.\n\nThe series was created by Irna Phillips, who based it on personal experiences. After giving birth to a still-born baby at age 19, she found spiritual comfort listening to the radio sermons of Preston Bradley, a famous Chicago preacher and founder of the People's Church, a church which promoted the brotherhood of man. These sermons originated the idea of the creation of \"The Guiding Light\", which began as a radio series. The original radio series was first broadcast as 15-minute episodes on NBC Radio, starting on January 25, 1937. The series was transferred to CBS Radio during 1947.\n\n\"The Guiding Light\" was broadcast first by CBS Television on June 30, 1952, replacing the canceled soap opera \"The First Hundred Years\". These episodes were also 15 minutes long. During the period from 1952 to 1956, \"The Guiding Light\" existed as both a radio and television serial, with actors recording their performances twice for each day that the shows were broadcast. The radio broadcast of \"The Guiding Light\" ceased production during 1956, ending this overlap.\n\nWith the transition to television, the main characters became the Bauers, a lower-middle class German immigrant family who were first introduced in the radio serial in 1948. Many storylines revolved around Bill Bauer (son of patriarch Friedrich \"Papa\" Bauer) and his new wife Bertha (nicknamed \"Bert\"). Papa Bauer, who came to the United States during World War I with just a few dollars in his pocket, was a salt of the earth character who succeeded in offering opportunities to his children by working hard, and he instilled that work ethic into his children. Bert had dreams of climbing the social ladder and keeping up appearances, and it was up to Bill (and sometimes Papa Bauer) to bring her down to earth.\n\n\"The Guiding Light\" ranked as the number one-rated soap opera during both 1956 and 1957, before being replaced during 1958 by \"As the World Turns\". After Irna Phillips was transferred to \"As the World Turns\" during 1958, her protege Agnes Nixon became head writer of \"The Guiding Light\".\n\nThe first television producer of \"The Guiding Light\" was Luci Ferri Rittenberg, who produced the show over 20 years.\n\nAgnes Nixon relinquished her role as chief writer during 1965 to work for the series \"Another World\". On March 13, 1967, \"The Guiding Light\" was first broadcast in color. On September 9, 1968, the program was expanded from 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nThe 1960s featured the introduction of African American characters, and the main emphasis of the series shifted to Bill and Bert's children, Mike and Ed; the character of Bill Bauer was written out in July 1969, presumed dead after a plane crash. The show also became a bit more topical during the 1960s, with such storylines as Bert Bauer's diagnosis of uterine cancer in 1962.\n\nA number of new characters were introduced during the mid- to late 1960s, including Dr. Sara McIntyre, who remained a major character through the early 1980s.\n\nMuch of the story during the first half of the 1970s was dominated by Stanley Norris' November 1971 murder and the ensuing trial, as well as the exploits of villainesses Charlotte Waring and Kit Vested. Charlotte (at the time played by Melinda Fee) was murdered by Kit (Nancy Addison) on August 26, 1973, and then Kit herself was shot by Dr. Joe Werner (Anthony Call) in self-defense on April 24, 1974, after she had attempted to poison Dr. Sara McIntyre.\n\nA pivotal character, off-and-on, until the spring of 1998, Roger Thorpe, was introduced on April 1, 1971. The role of Roger was originally proposed to be a blond, fair-skinned, preppy type, a man who was dating his boss's daughter Holly. Ultimately, Michael Zaslow, a dark haired actor with a more ethnic appearance, was hired for the role instead by long-time casting director, Betty Rea. Zaslow portrayed Roger as a complicated and multifaceted villain.\n\nTheo Goetz, the actor who played Papa Bauer since the first episode of \"The Guiding Light\", died in 1972. The decision was made to have Papa Bauer die in the storyline as well. The cast paid tribute to Goetz and Papa Bauer in a special memorial episode which aired on February 27, 1973.\n\nPressured by newer, more youth-oriented soap operas such as \"All My Children\", Procter & Gamble hired head writers Bridget and Jerome Dobson during 1975, who started writing in November 1975. The Dobsons introduced a more nuanced, psychologically layered writing style, and included timely story lines, including a complex love/hate relationship between estranged spouses/step-siblings Roger and Holly. They also created a number of well-remembered characters, including Rita Stapleton, whose complex relationships with Roger and Ed propelled much of the story for the remainder of the decade, Alan Spaulding, and Ross Marler, both of whom remained major characters into the 2000s.\n\nThe decision was made during the fall of 1977 to reintroduce the thought-dead character of Bill Bauer, in a major retcon. The other characters thought that he had died in an airplane crash in July 1969, but he was said to actually be alive. (Many viewers who had also paid attention to the show and story line back in September 1968, remembered that Bill was told he would only have nine more years to live.) One of the problems with this return is that the Dobsons seemed not quite sure what to do with his return. Although it was shocking, at first, to many of the characters, Bill himself ended up being charged for a murder of a man in Vancouver (Mike got his father off for the crime, proving that it was an accident, rather quickly and by April 1978 Bill had left town, again. Although Bill returned briefly in November 1978, April 1980, and then again in July 1983 and in flashbacks in November 1983.) Bill's return introduced the audience and the Bauers to another character that stayed on the show until September 1984, Hillary Kincaid, R. N. (Bauer), Bill's daughter (and thus Ed and Mike's half-sister; Bill had accidentally killed the man that Hillary originally thought was her father, but was actually her step-father) and she becomes a nurse at Cedars and a major character.\n\nSurprising many viewers, Jerome and Bridget Dobson killed the show's young heroine, Leslie Jackson Bauer Norris Bauer, in June 1976. Lynne Adams was reported at the time to want to leave the role, and the Dobsons decided against recasting the part. Leslie was killed by a drunk driver. Her father, Dr. Steve Jackson, remained on the show for the remainder of the '70s, serving as a senior physician at Cedars, and as a friend and companion to Bert Bauer.\n\nIn November 1975, the name was changed in the show's opening and closing visuals from \"The Guiding Light\" to \"Guiding Light\". On November 7, 1977, the show expanded to a full hour and was broadcast from 2:30 to 3:30 pm daily.\n\nThe series during the 1970s emphasized the Bauers and the Spauldings. Several notable characters were introduced.\n\nBridget and Jerome Dobson assumed the head writing duties of \"As the World Turns\" in late 1979. Former actor Douglas Marland, assumed the head writing reins of \"Guiding Light\" in 1979. He introduced many new characters, including the Reardon family. During May 1980, \"Guiding Light\" won its first Outstanding Drama Series Daytime Emmy. One of Marland's stories featured the character of Carrie Todd Marler, played by Jane Elliot. Carrie was diagnosed with multiple personalities. Marland had barely delved into her psychosis when Elliot's contract was abruptly terminated by Executive Producer Allen M. Potter in 1982. As a result, Marland resigned in protest.\n\nDuring the early 1980s, the show began to emphasize younger characters more, as an attempt to compete with the younger-skewing ABC serials. A number of longtime characters were eliminated during this time, including Ben and Eve McFarren, Diane Ballard, Dr. Sara McIntyre, Adam Thorpe, Barbara Norris Thorpe, Justin Marler and Steve Jackson. Actress Lenore Kasdorf quit the show in 1981, and producers decided not to recast the role of Rita Stapleton Bauer, given how popular Kasdorf had been. The Bauer family matriarch, Bertha 'Bert' Bauer, died in March 1986, following the real-life death of Charita Bauer in 1985. During Guiding Light's 50th anniversary year in 1987, a commitment was pledged to showcase the Bauer family in primary roles as much as possible, after audience reaction to the Oklahoma-bred Lewis and Shayne families turned out to be mixed. As a result, the tradition of the Bauer July 4 family barbecue began that year, and continued until 2009, the serial's final year on CBS Television.\n\nAn ever more complicated storyline emphasized the Bauer, Spaulding, Reardon, and Raines families. Pam Long, actress and writer for NBC's \"Texas\" from 1981 to 1982, became head writer during 1983 and reemphasized the series on Freddy Bauer Phillip Spaulding, Mindy Lewis, and Beth Raines. She also introduced characters Alexandra Spaulding, performed by actress Beverlee McKinsey, of \"Another World\" and \"Texas\" fame; and Reva Shayne, played by Kim Zimmer. The ratings in the mid- to late 1980s were solid and healthy. Pamela K. Long returned for a second head writer stint from 1987 to 1990.\n\nThe characters of Roger Thorpe and Holly Norris returned to the series during the late 1980s. Maureen Garrett reprised her role of Holly #2 in 1988, followed by Michael Zaslow as Roger in 1989.\n\nWith the new decade, the series' storytelling transitioned from Long's homespun style to a more realistic style with a new group of chief writers. The Bauer, Spaulding, Lewis, and Cooper families had been established as core families, and most major plot developments concerned them. The show generally held on in the middle of the pack as far as ratings went throughout the decade.\n\nThe show suffered major character losses mid-decade, including the car accident death of Maureen Bauer and the exit of Alexandra Spaulding from the story. As the decade progressed, the program developed a series of outlandish plot twists seemingly to compete with the serials \"Passions\" and \"Days of Our Lives\".\n\nIn an attempt to revive the series, the character Reva Shayne was brought back to Springfield during April 1995. She'd been presumed dead for the previous five years, after having driven her car off of a bridge and into the water off the Florida Keys. Later that July, antiheroine Tangie Hill (played by Marcy Walker, who declined to renew her contract) was eliminated after nearly two years with the show in favor of the full-time return of fan favorite Nola Chamberlain, played by Lisa Brown.\n\nDuring January 1996, soap opera veteran Mary Stuart joined the cast as Meta Bauer (though referred to many times over the years, the long-running character originally played by Ellen Demming had not been seen onscreen since 1974); the character remained on the show until Stuart's death during 2002.\n\nJanuary 1998, Bethany Joy Lenz came to the show as \"Teenage Reva Clone\". Producers were so impressed with her acting and attitude during her three-week role as \"Teenage Reva Clone\" on the show that she was re-hired later that year in the contract role of \"Michelle Bauer Santos\" on the daytime serial. From 1999-2000.\n\nThe 2000s began with the division of the show into two locales: Springfield and the fictional island nation of San Cristobel. In Springfield, the Santos mob dynasty created much of the drama. Meanwhile, the royal Winslow family had their own series of intrigues with which to deal. During 2002, however, San Cristobel was eliminated from the series and the mob's influence in the story was subsequently diminished and, with the departure of character Danny Santos during 2005, eliminated altogether. Also, \"Guiding Light\" celebrated its 50th Anniversary as a television show on June 30, 2002.\n\nDuring 2004, former director and actress Ellen Wheeler (Emmy Award winner as an actress for the series \"All My Children\" and \"Another World\") took over as executive producer of \"Guiding Light.\" She and writer David Kreizman made numerous changes to the sets, stories, and the cast. Several veteran actors were eliminated, mainly because of budget decreases. Because of the lack of veteran influence, Wheeler reemphasized the youth of Springfield, especially the controversial pairing of cousins Jonathan and Tammy.\n\nDuring 2006, an episode featured character Harley Cooper gaining heroic abilities. The episode was semi-continued in an 8-page story in select Marvel Comics productions.\n\nThe series had its 70th broadcast anniversary during 2007. The anniversary was commemorated with the initiation of website FindYourLight.net and a program of outreach, representing Irna Phillips's original message. There was also a special episode during January 2007, with current cast members playing Phillips and some of the earlier cast members. The series also introduced special beginning credits commemorating the anniversary.\n\nDespite low ratings, the show won 2007 Daytime Emmy Awards for Best Writing and Best Show (sharing Best Show with\" The Young and the Restless\").\n\nOn April 1, 2009, CBS announced that it would not renew \"Guiding Light\", and the last broadcast date would be September 18, 2009. Procter & Gamble initially announced that they would attempt to find another outlet to distribute the series, but later admitted that they had been unsuccessful in doing so, and that on September 18, 2009, after 57 years on television (preceded by 15 years on radio for a total broadcast history of 72 years), \"Guiding Light\" would end its broadcast history on CBS.\n\nDuring the final weeks of the series, numerous characters from the series' past passed through Springfield one last time, culminating with Ed and Holly, who impulsively embarked on an unspecified journey together. Alan Spaulding suffered fatal heart failure during the final week, but not before resolving conflicts with many former adversaries, including Jonathan. Alan's death brought the characters together in a way that could not have happened while he was still alive. Alexandra is especially distraught about Alan's death, but was pleased when Fletcher Reade came to the Spaulding Mansion after Alan's service, and convinced her to accompany him to Europe. Beth and Phillip have grown closer and decided to remarry; Mindy Lewis returned to Springfield for good, and she and Rick also became fonder of each other. Reva and Josh had a discussion, and agreed that they each had their respective problems that they need to solve. Josh told Reva that he was leaving Springfield for a job for the next year, but proposes that he return one year from that date and, if by that time, she wants to reunite with him, she should meet him at the lighthouse and, if she is not there, he will assume she is not interested.\n\nThe final episode is pleasant, featuring many of the characters gathering in the park for a large picnic. Toward the end of the episode, it jumps forward one year, by which time, Phillip and Beth have reunited, as have Rick and Mindy. Olivia and Natalia, happy with their new baby, pick up Raphael as he returns from the army. The episode concludes with Josh arriving at the lighthouse, as promised, and finding Reva there. They declare their undying love. James, Ashlee, and Daisy leave Springfield and relocate to Santa Barbara, California. Josh asks if Reva is packed, to go on an adventure. The two grab the luggage, and with Reva's young son, they climb into Josh's pick-up truck. Josh says to Reva, \"You ready?\" She replies \"Always.\" As the truck drives away with the lighthouse in the background, \"The End\" appears on the screen before a final fadeout. The song heard playing in the background during the final scene is \"Together\" by Michelle Branch.\n\nThe final episode also included the original tag line, with some revision, printed on the screen with the words \"There is a destiny that makes us FAMILY\" (replacing the word 'brothers'), as well as quick film clips of each of the show's title cards and announcers during the six decades it was on television, leading to the show's former long-time beginning announcement: \"And now, \"The Guiding Light\"\".\n\n\"Guiding Light\" was broadcast from three locations: Chicago (where creator Irna Phillips resided), from 1937 until 1946; Hollywood, from 1947 until 1949; and New York City starting during 1949. It was relocated from Chicago to Hollywood (despite objections of both Phillips and Arthur Peterson) to take advantage of the talent pool. Production was subsequently relocated to New York City, where the majority of soap operas were produced during the 1950s, 1960s and much of the 1970s; it remained based in New York City until the show's conclusion. Its final taping location was the CBS studios in midtown Manhattan. From the 1970s to the 1990s it was filmed at the Chelsea Studios. From soon before February 29, 2008, outdoor scenes were filmed on location in Peapack, New Jersey. The location filming coincided with another significant production change, as the series became the first American weekday soap opera to be recorded digitally. The production team chose to film with Canon XH-G1 HDV camcorders.\nUnlike the old production model with pedestal-style cameras and traditional three-sided sets, handheld cameras allowed producers to choose as many locations as they wished.\n\nDuring the daytime drama's 57th season on television and 72nd overall season, the series had changed its look to a more realistic experience in an attempt to compete with the growing popularity of reality television. The new look of \"Guiding Light\" included free-hand camera work and less action shown on traditional studio sets. Producer Ellen Wheeler introduced a \"shaky-cam\" style, present in a number of movies, featuring extreme-closeups and frequent cuts, including those that \"broke the axis\" (which proved disorienting to viewers accustomed to shows with the traditional \"soap opera look\"). Also new was the filming of outdoor scenes in actual outdoor settings. Even many indoor scenes had more of an \"on location\" feel, repurposing real locations, such as \"Guiding Light's\" production offices, to be motel rooms, nail salons, quick-mart and other businesses or locations. Thereby, the series had numerous sets without the cost of numerous separate locations. CBS and the show's producers had hoped that the new look would increase ratings, but the plan was ultimately unsuccessful.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, CBS canceled the series after 72 years, with the series finale airing on September 18, 2009, making it the second-to-last Procter & Gamble soap opera to end.\n\nThe action has also been set in three different locales – it was based in the fictional towns of Five Points and Selby Flats before its final locale of Springfield.\n\nUnlike most popular radio serials transitioning to television, \"The Guiding Light\" had no difficulty holding onto its old listening audience and simultaneously earning a new television fanbase. For at the time \"The Guiding Light\" made its television debut, neither ABC nor NBC had broadcast programs on their respective networks at 2:30 p.m. Eastern/1:30 Central, where CBS first placed \"The Guiding Light\". However, six months into the run, the network moved the serial to a timeslot that gave it great popularity with its housewife audience: 12:45 p.m./11:45 a.m. It kept the new timeslot for the next 19 years and eight months, sharing the half-hour with its sister Procter & Gamble-packaged soap opera, \"Search for Tomorrow.\"\n\n\"The Guiding Light\" handled the competition breezily, even against otherwise-legendary shows such as \"Queen for a Day\" on ABC (briefly in 1960) and NBC's \"Truth or Consequences.\" Usually, \"The Guiding Light\" ranked second in the Nielsen ratings behind another serial, \"As the World Turns.\" 1968, however, saw changing viewership trends that prompted CBS to expand its last two 15-minute daytime dramas, disrupting long-standing viewing habits. \"Search for Tomorrow\" took over the entire 12:30–1/11:30–Noon period, with \"The Guiding Light\" returning to its first timeslot, 2:30/1:30, albeit in the now-standard half-hour format, on September 9. This twin bill of expansions also caused the dislocation of \"The Secret Storm\" and the beloved \"Art Linkletter's House Party,\" as well as the cancellation of the daytime \"To Tell the Truth.\" It also put the serial in direct competition with NBC's \"The Doctors\", which was beginning to peak in its popularity. Thus, the early 1970s saw the popularity of \"The Guiding Light\" dip somewhat. \n\nAfter four years of airing at 2:30/1:30, CBS acceded to a demand made by \"The Guiding Light\" producer Procter & Gamble and moved its sibling series, \"The Edge of Night\", to the earlier hour from its previous home at 3:30/2:30. Moving back one half hour, \"The Guiding Light\" stayed steadily on course against NBC's \"Days of Our Lives\" and ABC's \"The Newlywed Game.\" In late 1974, ABC replaced \"The Newlywed Game\" with \"The $10,000 Pyramid,\" which went on to garner strong ratings, but not greatly at \"The Guiding Light's\" expense. In 1975, the show officially dropped the word \"The\" from its title, although it was still referred to as \"The Guiding Light\" on air for several years after. \n\nAs the year progressed, CBS was looking to expand one of its daytime soap operas. All of its serials were now thirty minutes in length and had been since \"Guiding Light\" and \"Search For Tomorrow\" made the move in 1968. NBC had found ratings success with expanding \"Another World\", another Procter and Gamble production, earlier in 1975, and CBS thought it too could find success. The decision was made to expand \"As the World Turns\", which was airing before \"Guiding Light\" at 1:30/12:30. Thus, in December, \"Guiding Light\" moved back to 2:30/1:30 in place of \"The Edge of Night\", which switched networks and began airing on ABC. ABC had a short-lived hit the next year with an updated version of the game show \"Break the Bank.\" To complicate the picture further, ABC opted to make its first show expansions, that of \"One Life to Live\" and \"General Hospital,\" in July 1976; each of those shows occupied one-half of a 90-minute block until November 4, 1977.\n\nWith this in mind, ABC and CBS acted to give a contending chance to both \"General Hospital\" and \"Guiding Light\" by expanding them to an hour in length. CBS did so first by expanding \"Guiding Light\" on November 7, 1977. This gained particular importance when ABC finally added 15 minutes to both \"One Life to Live\" and \"General Hospital\" on January 16, 1978, so that \"Guiding Light\" straddled those two programs, as well as the first half of sister P&G show \"Another World\" on NBC. Despite that \"General Hospital\" surprising all observers by skyrocketing from near-cancellation to the top place in the ratings with the various storylines, \"Guiding Light\" held its own while in direct competition with \"General Hospital\", still hit an upswing as the decade ended.\n\nOn February 4, 1980, CBS bumped \"Guiding Light\" down again, to 3pm/2c, and its sister P&G soap \"As The World Turns\" to 2pm/1c, in the midst of a major scheduling shuffle intended to give \"The Young and the Restless\" (itself now expanding to an hour length) a shot at beating ABC's \"All My Children\". NBC did the same with its soap operas as well with all three networks now going head-head in every time slot. It remained in this time slot for the rest of its run in some markets, facing \"General Hospital\" and NBC entries such as \"Texas\" (a spin-off of \"Another World\"), \"The Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour\" and \"Santa Barbara.\" None of these shows - not even \"General Hospital\" - had any significant impact on the ratings of \"Guiding Light\" at 3:00 pm during this period.\n\nOverall, the first half of the 1980s saw a revival in \"Guiding Light's\" popularity, with a top-five placing achieved in most years and even a brief dethroning of then-powerhouse \"General Hospital\" from the #1 ratings spot for three consecutive weeks. However, as the decade progressed, the ratings slipped a bit, although it was still performing solidly. In 1995, beginning with CBS flagship station WCBS-TV in New York, \"Guiding Light\" began airing at 10 a.m. Eastern time in several markets. Its once-solid performance began to crumble by the mid-1990s, when its ratings sunk as low as ninth place out of ten. However, during the controversial clone storyline in 1998, the ratings experienced a brief resurgence, moving up to fifth for many weeks that summer. Nielsen reported \"Guiding Light\" had 5 million viewers in 1999.\n\nUp until its finale in 2009, stations in a number of markets aired \"Guiding Light\" in the morning either at 9 or 10 a.m. local time: Miami, Chicago, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Dallas-Fort Worth, Orlando, Atlanta, Columbia, SC, Fort Wayne, IN, South Bend, IN, Portland, OR, Quad Cities, Buffalo, Reno, Portland, ME, Milwaukee, Albany, NY, and Scranton-Wilkes Barre, PA. \"Guiding Light\" aired at 12 noon local time in Honolulu, Hawaii. In Savannah, GA, it aired at 4:00 pm local time.\n\nBefore 2004, stations that aired \"Guiding Light\" in the morning were always one episode behind those that aired the program at its official timeslot of 3:00 pm (ET). This changed in March 2004, during the first day of the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament, in which stations airing the show at 10:00 am were able catch up with stations that televised it at 3:00 pm. Starting in 2006, stations that televised \"Guiding Light\" at 9:00 am were also offered a same-day feed to catch up with the rest of the network. As a result of this, daily episodes for the remaining years of \"GL\" were the same on all stations regardless of timeslot.\n\n\"Guiding Light\" maintained strong ratings in Pittsburgh, despite being moved to 10:00 am in 2006. According to a 2006 article in the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\", \"Dr. Phil\" hadn't been able to pull in the same numbers that \"Guiding Light\" did in that time slot a year prior, while \"Guiding Light\" was maintaining its audience share.\n\nOne CBS affiliate that did not air the show was KOVR-TV in Sacramento, California, which had become a CBS affiliate in 1995. Before CBS affiliated with KOVR, it had been affiliated in Sacramento with KXTV, which had dropped \"Guiding Light\" from its schedule in 1992 and did not air it again. As such, the show was preempted in the Sacramento area from 1992 to the show's cancellation. WNEM-TV in Flint/Saginaw/Bay City, Michigan, which also became a CBS affiliate that year, initially ran the soap before dropping it in 1996 because of disappointing ratings. In the fall of 2006, WNEM began running \"Guiding Light\" on its digital channel My 5 at 10 am, airing there for the remainder of its run.\n\nIn Canada, \"Guiding Light\" was available to viewers directly through CBS-TV network affiliates from border cities or cable TV feeds until the show's ending in 2009. In addition, \"Guiding Light\" also made it on several Canadian television networks through the 1980s up until its last air date.\n\nAtlantic Satellite Network (ASN) – a supplementary service to its ATV system of CTV affiliates exclusively for Atlantic Canada – aired the soap simultaneously with the CBS feed from 1983 to 1984; then, the broadcast was moved to 12 noon until 1985.\n\nThe show also aired in French in Quebec. TVA, a Quebec privately owned French-language television network, rebroadcast episodes in French translation, twelve months behind, for a short period in 1984.\n\nIn the late 1980s into the early 1990s, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) briefly aired the P&G serial nationally at 3:00 p.m. in each specific local Canadian time zone. The CBC Television broadcast of \"Guiding Light\" was also on its scheduled during the latter part of the 1960s during the serial 15-minute format. On both occasions, the daytime drama was only aired for a few seasons.\n\nAfter a hiatus from Canadian television stations for many years, the series came back on CHCH-TV, exclusively for the Ontario market. In September 2007, Global picked up the show nationwide after CHCH-TV dropped it, claiming \"Passions\"’ former time slot. \"Guiding Light\" returned to CHCH for the rest of its run when Global decided to air the 2008 TV series \"The Doctors\".\n\n\nIn January 2012, SoapClassics released a four-disc DVD collection of 20 selected episodes. The oldest episode on the collection dates from April 1, 1980, while the latest episode is from September 14, 2009, during the show's final broadcast week.\n\nThe company has since released special collections celebrating Reva Shayne and Phillip Spaulding.\n\nIn May 2012, SoapClassics released the final ten \"Guiding Light\" episodes on a two-disc DVD set.\n\nAlso beginning in June 2012 the series was released on DVD in Germany beginning with the 1979 episodes.\n"}
{"id": "174220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=174220", "title": "Gunsmoke", "text": "Gunsmoke\n\nGunsmoke is an American radio and television Western drama series created by director Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston. The stories take place in and around Dodge City, Kansas, during the settlement of the American West. The central character is lawman Marshal Matt Dillon, played by William Conrad on radio and James Arness on television. When aired in the United Kingdom, the television series was initially titled Gun Law, later reverting to \"Gunsmoke\".\n\nThe radio series ran from 1952 to 1961. John Dunning wrote that among radio drama enthusiasts, \"\"Gunsmoke\" is routinely placed among the best shows of any kind and any time.\" The television series ran for 20 seasons from 1955 to 1975, and lasted for 635 episodes. At the end of its run in 1975, \"Los Angeles Times\" columnist Cecil Smith wrote: \"\"Gunsmoke\" was the dramatization of the American epic legend of the west. Our own \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\", created from standard elements of the dime novel and the pulp Western as romanticized by [Ned] Buntline, [Bret] Harte, and [Mark] Twain. It was ever the stuff of legend.\"\n\nIn the late 1940s, CBS chairman William S. Paley, a fan of the \"Philip Marlowe\" radio serial, asked his programming chief, Hubell Robinson, to develop a hardboiled Western series, a show about a \"Philip Marlowe of the Old West\". Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, Harry Ackerman, who had developed the \"Philip Marlowe\" series, to take on the task.\n\nAckerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called \"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\" based on one of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, \"The Case of the Crooked Wheel\" from the summer of 1948. Two versions were recorded. The first, recorded in June 1949, was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second, recorded in July 1949, starred \"Straight Arrow\" actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.\n\nA complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of \"Straight Arrow\" would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years, when producer Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.\n\nMacdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as \"The Lone Ranger\" and \"The Cisco Kid.\" \"Gunsmoke\" was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning notes, \"The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.\"\n\nThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952 with the episode \"Billy the Kid\", written by Walter Newman, and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.\n\nMatt Dillon was played on radio by William Conrad and on TV by James Arness. Two versions of the same pilot episode titled \"Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye\" were produced with two different actors, Rye Billsbury and Howard Culver, playing Marshal \"Mark\" Dillon as the lead, not yet played by Conrad. Conrad was one of the last actors to audition for the role of Marshal Dillon. With a resonantly powerful and distinctive voice, Conrad was already one of radio's busiest actors. Though Meston championed him, Macdonnell thought Conrad might be overexposed. During his audition, however, Conrad won over Macdonnell after reading only a few lines. Dillon, as portrayed by Conrad, was a lonely, isolated man, toughened by a hard life. Macdonnell later claimed, \"Much of Matt Dillon's character grew out of Bill Conrad.\"\n\nMeston relished the upending of cherished Western fiction clichés and felt that few Westerns gave any inkling of how brutal the Old West was in reality. Many episodes were based on man's cruelty to man and woman, inasmuch as the prairie woman's life and the painful treatment of women as chattels were touched on well ahead of their time in most media. As originally pitched to CBS executives, this was to be an adult Western, not a grown-up Hopalong Cassidy.\n\nDunning writes that Meston was especially disgusted by the archetypal Western hero and set out \"to destroy [that type of] character he loathed\". In Meston's view, \"Dillon was almost as scarred as the homicidal psychopaths who drifted into Dodge from all directions.\"\n\nChester was played by Parley Baer on radio, and by Dennis Weaver on television.\nChester's character had no surname until Baer ad libbed \"Proudfoot\" during an early rehearsal. Initial \"Gunsmoke\" scripts gave him no name at all; his lines were simply slugged to be spoken by \"Townsman\". Again, Conrad's sense of what the program would be supervened, and Chester was born. Chester's middle initial was given as \"W\" in the June 15, 1958, episode \"Old Flame\", and a few episodes later, on the July 7, 1958, episode \"Marshal Proudfoot\", his middle name, and that of his 10 siblings, is revealed to be Wesley. The amiable Waco expatriate was usually described as Dillon's \"assistant\", but in the December 13, 1952, episode \"Post Martin\", Dillon described Chester as Dillon's deputy. Contradicting this description, in the July 5, 1954, episode \"Hank Prine\" (episode 116, minute 3:02) Dillon corrects a prisoner who describes Chester as his \"deputy\", stating \"Chester is not my deputy\", though they both agree Chester acts like he is. Whatever his title, Chester was Dillon's foil, friend, partner, and in an episode in which Chester nearly dies (\"Never Pester Chester\"), Dillon allows that Chester was the only person he could trust.\n\nThe TV series changed the newly limping Chester's last name from Proudfoot to Goode. Chester was played by Dennis Weaver, who went on to star in the NBC \"Mystery Movie\" rotating TV series entry of a police drama with a comedic touch, \"McCloud\", in the early 1970s. Weaver, himself an impressive 6'2\", often looked small alongside Arness' height at 6'7\"; this could be partly due to the character Chester having a limp. Season two, episode 25 reveals that Chester was in the army. He would not have had the limp then, so probably got injured in the Civil War, not long ago, but long enough that he would have learned to live with the limp and virtually forget it.\n\nHoward McNear starred as Dr. Charles Adams in the radio series, with Milburn Stone portraying Dr. Galen Adams in the television version.\nIn the radio series, \"Doc\" Adams was initially a self-interested and somewhat dark character with a predilection for constantly attempting to increase his revenue through the procurement of autopsy fees. However, McNear's performances steadily became more warm-hearted and sympathetic. Most notably, this transformation began during (and progressed steadily following) the July 1952 episode \"Never Pester Chester\", in which a physician with a more compassionate and devoted temperament is essential to the plotline when Chester is near-fatally injured by two trouble-making Texas drovers.\n\nDoc Adams' backstory evokes a varied and experienced life: In some episodes, he had educational ties to Philadelphia; in others, he spent time as ship's doctor aboard the gambling boats that plied the Mississippi River, which provided a background for his knowledge of New Orleans (and acquaintance with Mark Twain). In the January 31, 1953, episode \"Cavalcade\", a fuller history is offered, though subsequent programs kept close listeners' heads spinning. In \"Cavalcade\", his real name is Calvin Moore, educated in Boston, and he practiced as a doctor for a year in Richmond, Virginia, where he fell in love with a beautiful young woman, who was also being courted by a wealthy young man named Roger Beauregard. Beauregard forced Doc into fighting a duel with him, resulting in Beauregard's being shot and killed. Though it was a fair duel, as a Yankee and an outsider, Doc was forced to flee. The young woman fled after him and they were married in St. Louis, but two months later, she died of typhus.\n\nDoc wandered throughout the territories until he settled in Dodge City 17 years later under the name of \"Charles Adams\". The Adams moniker was another Conrad invention, borrowing the surname from cartoonist Charles Addams as a testament to Doc's initially ghoulish comportment.\n\nKitty was played by Georgia Ellis on radio, and by Amanda Blake on TV.\nWhile actress Georgia Ellis first appeared in the radio episode \"Billy the Kid\" (April 26, 1952) as \"Francie Richards\" - a former girlfriend of Matt Dillon and the widow of a criminal - the character of \"Miss Kitty\" did not appear until the May 10, 1952, episode \"Jaliscoe\". Sometime in 1959, Ellis was billed as Georgia Hawkins instead of Georgia Ellis. Amanda Blake appeared in over 500 episodes of the television series, with her last being the April 1, 1974 episode titled, \"The Disciple\" when the character was last seen.\n\nIn the radio series, Kitty's profession was hinted at, but never explicit; in a 1953 interview with \"Time,\" Macdonnell declared, \"Kitty is just someone Matt has to visit every once in a while\". The magazine observed that she is \"obviously not selling chocolate bars\". An out-take from the program makes this hilariously obvious. The television show first portrayed Kitty as a saloon employee (dance-hall girl/prostitute), then from season three as half-owner of the Long Branch Saloon.\n\n\"Gunsmoke\" was often a somber program, particularly in its early years. Dunning writes that Dillon \"played his hand and often lost. He arrived too late to prevent a lynching. He amputated a dying man's leg and lost the patient anyway. He saved a girl from brutal rapists then found himself unable to offer her what she needed to stop her from moving into ... life as a prostitute.\" Some listeners, such as Dunning, argue the radio version was more realistic. Episodes were aimed at adults and featured some of the most explicit content of their time, including violent crimes, scalpings, massacres, and opium addicts. Many episodes ended on a somber note, and villains often got away with their crimes.\n\nNonetheless, due to the subtle scripts and outstanding ensemble cast, over the years, the program evolved into a warm, often humorous celebration of human nature. Despite Gunsmoke's realism in some areas, the show took liberties with accuracy in others. The program was set after the arrival of the railroad in Dodge City (1872) and Kansas had been a state since 1861. A U.S. Marshal (actually a deputy marshal, only the senior officer in the district holds the title \"marshal\") would not be based in Dodge City and would not be involved in local law enforcement. Any peace officer, then and now, also would not approach an armed individual with his side arm holstered, and give the suspect a chance to draw.\n\nApart from the doleful tone, \"Gunsmoke\" was distinct from other radio Westerns, as the dialogue was often slow and halting, and due to the outstanding sound effects, listeners had a nearly palpable sense of the prairie where the show was set. The effects were subtle but multilayered, giving the show a spacious feel. John Dunning wrote, \"The listener heard extraneous dialogue in the background, just above the muted shouts of kids playing in an alley. He heard noises from the next block, too, where the inevitable dog was barking.\"\n\n\"Gunsmoke\" was also unique from other Westerns in that it was unsponsored in the first few years of production. The program got its support from CBS in the first two years. Series producers felt that if the show were sponsored, they would have to \"clean the show up\". The producers wanted to find a sponsor that would allow them to keep the show the way it was.\n\nNot long after the radio show began, talk began of adapting it to television. Privately, Macdonnell had a guarded interest in taking the show to television, but publicly, he declared, \"our show is perfect for radio,\" and he feared, as Dunning writes, \"\"Gunsmoke\" confined by a picture could not possibly be as authentic or attentive to detail.\" \"In the end\", wrote Dunning, \"CBS simply took it away from Macdonnell and began preparing for the television version.\"\n\nConrad and the others were given auditions, but they were little more than token efforts—especially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a majority of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, \"That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise no one. That the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts.\" \n\nMacdonnell and Meston continued the radio version of \"Gunsmoke\" until 1961, making it one of the most enduring vintage radio dramas.\n\nConrad directed two television episodes, in 1963 and 1971, while McNear appeared on six, playing characters other than Doc, including three times as storekeeper Howard Rudd.\n\nThe TV series ran from September 10, 1955, to March 31, 1975, on CBS, with 635 total episodes. It was the second Western television series written for adults, premiering on September 10, 1955, four days after \"The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp\". The first 12 seasons aired Saturdays at 10 pm, seasons 13 through 16 aired Mondays at 7:30 pm, and the last four seasons aired Mondays at 8 pm. During its second season in 1956, the program joined the list of the top-10 television programs broadcast in the United States. It quickly moved to number one and stayed there until 1961. It remained among the top-20 programs until 1964.\n\nThe television series remains the longest-running, primetime, live-action series of the 20th century. , it had the highest number of scripted episodes for any U.S. primetime, commercial, live-action television series. On April 29, 2018, \"The Simpsons\" surpassed \"Gunsmoke\" for the most scripted episodes. Some TV fans question its position as having the longest run. Some foreign-made programs, i.e. produced outside the U.S., have been broadcast in the U.S. and contend for the position as the longest-running series. , \"Gunsmoke\" was rated fourth globally, after \"Doctor Who\" (1963–89, 2005–present), \"Taggart\" (1983–2010), and \"The Bill\" (1984–2010).\n\nJames Arness and Milburn Stone portrayed their \"Gunsmoke\" characters for 20 consecutive years, a feat later matched by Kelsey Grammer as the character Frasier Crane, but over two half-hour sitcoms (\"Cheers\" and \"Frasier\"). George Walsh, the announcer for \"Gunsmoke\", began in 1952 on radio's \"Gunsmoke\" and continued until television's \"Gunsmoke\" was cancelled in 1975. The first seven seasons were jointly sponsored by L&M cigarettes and Remington shaving products.\n\nWhen \"Gunsmoke\" was adapted for television in 1955, in spite of a campaign to persuade the network, the network was not interested in bringing either Conrad or his radio costars to the television medium. Conrad's weight was rumored to be a deciding factor. Denver Pyle was also considered for the leading role, as was Raymond Burr, who was ultimately also seen as too heavy for the part. Charles Warren, television \"Gunsmoke\"'s first director, said, \"His voice was fine, but he was too big. When he stood up, his chair stood with him.\" According to Dennis Weaver's comments on the 50th Anniversary DVD, disc one, episode \"Hack Prine\", John Wayne was never considered for the role; to have done so would have been preposterous, since Wayne was a top movie leading man. The belief that Wayne was asked to star is disputed by Warren. Although he agrees Wayne encouraged Arness to take the role, Warren says, \"I hired Jim Arness on the strength of a picture he's done for me ... I never thought for a moment of offering it to Wayne.\"\n\nAccording to Thomas \"Duke\" Miller, a TV/movie/celebrity expert, this story was told to him by legendary actor James Stewart: \"Jimmy said he was in the office with Charles Warren when Mr. Wayne came in. Mr. Warren asked Wayne if he knew James Arness, and Mr. Wayne said yes. Mr. Warren told Mr. Wayne about the transition of the show from radio to TV, and Mr. Wayne readily agreed that James Arness would be a terrific choice for the part of Matt Dillon. I have no reason to doubt the story, because Jimmy absolutely knew everybody.\"\n\nIn the end, the primary roles were all recast, with Arness taking the lead role of Marshal Matt Dillon (on the recommendation of Wayne, who also introduced the pilot), Dennis Weaver playing Chester Goode, Milburn Stone being cast as Dr. G. \"Doc\" Adams (later Galen \"Doc\" Adams), and Amanda Blake taking on the role of Miss Kitty Russell. Macdonnell became the associate producer of the TV show and later the producer. Meston was named head writer.\n\nChester and Festus Haggen are perhaps Dillon's most recognizable sidekicks, though others became acting deputies for - to -year stints: Quint Asper (Burt Reynolds) (1962–65), Thad Greenwood (Roger Ewing) (1966–68), and Newly O'Brien (Buck Taylor) (1967–75), who served as both back-up deputy and doctor-in-training, having some studies in medicine through his uncle, which then continued under Doc Adams.\n\nIn 1962, Burt Reynolds was added to the show's lineup, as the \"halfbreed\" blacksmith Quint Asper, and performed that role from the year just before the departure of Chester Goode and to just after the appearance of Festus Haggen. Three of the actors, who played Dodge deputies, Ken Curtis, Roger Ewing, and Buck Taylor, had previous guest roles. Curtis, a big band and Western singer (Tommy Dorsey Orchestra, Shep Fields Band, Sons of the Pioneers), had five previous guest roles, including one in 1963 as a shady ladies' man named Kyle Kelly (\"Lover Boy,\" season 9, show two [episode 307]).\n\nCurtis first appeared in the 1959 episode \"Jayhawkers\" (season four, episode 21 [episode 138]), wherein he played Phil Jacks, a Texas cowboy, with Jack Elam as his boss during a cattle drive from Texas. The second was another 1959 episode entitled \"Change of Heart\" (season four, episode 32 [episode 149]), where he played Brisco. The third appearance is the 1960 episode \"The Ex-Urbanites\" (season five, episode 30 [episode 186]), where he plays Jesse. He also had a small role as an Indian named Scout in the episode \"Speak Me Fair\" (season five, episode 34 [episode 190]) in 1960. Curtis was reared in Las Animas, Colorado, and for a time was a son-in-law of director John Ford.\n\nIn 1963, Weaver left the series to pursue a broader acting career in TV series and films. In 1964, Curtis was signed as a regular to play the stubbornly illiterate hillbilly Festus Haggen. The character, heretofore a comic feature, came to town in a 1962 episode titled \"Us Haggens\" to avenge the death of his twin brother Fergus, and decided to stay in Dodge when the deed was done. Initially on the fringes of Dodge society, Festus was slowly phased in as a reliable sidekick/part-time deputy to Matt Dillon when Reynolds left in 1965. In the episode \"Alias Festus Haggen\", he is mistaken for a robber and killer, whom he has to expose, to free himself (both parts played by Curtis). In a comic relief episode, \"Mad Dog\", another case of mistaken identity forces Festus to fight three sons of a man killed by his cousin. As a side note, only one episode has all three actors in it playing their respective roles, in the 1964 episode entitled \"Prairie Wolfer\" (season 9, episode 16 [episode 321]), with Dennis Weaver as Chester, Burt Reynolds as Quint, and Ken Curtis as Festus. The 1964 episode entitled \"Once a Haggen\" (season 9, episode 18 [episode 323]) is the second of only two occasions in which Chester and Festus appear in the same episode.\n\nWhen Milburn Stone left the series for heart bypass surgery in 1971, Pat Hingle played his temporary replacement, Dr. John Chapman, for several episodes. His presence was at first roundly resisted by Festus, a bickersome but close friend of Doc Adams.\n\nWell-known actors played \"visiting characters\".\nJeanette Nolan played Dirty Sally in several episodes.\n\nThe back stories of some of the main characters were largely left to the imagination of the viewer. Matt Dillon spent his early years in foster care, knew the Bible, was a wayward, brawling cowboy, and was later mentored by a caring lawman. In a few episodes, he mentions having spent some time in the army. Kitty Russell was born in New Orleans and reared by a flashy foster mother (who once visited Dodge), although her father visited Dodge on one occasion and wished to have her return to New Orleans. Barkeep Sam is said to be married, but no wife is ever seen. (In the episode \"Tafton\", he is seen side-by-side with a woman in a church singing.)\n\nQuint Asper's white father was killed by white scavengers. Thad Greenwood's father, a storekeeper, was harassed to death by a trio of loathsome ne'er-do-well thieves. Chester Goode is known to be one of many brothers raised by an aunt and uncle, and on one occasion, he mentions his mother; he refers to past service in the cavalry and years as a cattle driver in Texas. The cause of Chester's stiff right leg is never given, but it is shown as his own leg and not a prosthesis. No direct reference to his disability is ever made in the script, although some oblique moments paint the free-spirited, comic deputy with a darker tone. Newly O'Brien was named after a physician uncle who ignited his interest in medicine.\n\nWhile Dillon and Miss Kitty clearly have a close personal relationship, the two never marry. In a July 2, 2002, Associated Press interview with Bob Thomas, Arness explained, \"If they were man and wife, it would make a lot of difference. The people upstairs decided it was better to leave the show as it was, which I totally agreed with.\" In the episode \"Waste\", featuring Johnny Whitaker as a boy with a prostitute mother, her madam questions Dillon as to why the law overlooks Miss Kitty's enterprise. Apparently, bordellos could exist \"at the law's discretion,\" (meaning the marshal's). As a historical matter, prior to the First World War, few laws criminalized prostitution in the United States. The nearest that Matt and Miss Kitty have to a romantic evening together is when they try to have dinner over the Long Branch Saloon (\"A Quiet Day In Dodge\", 1973). Unfortunately, Marshal Dillon has been going over 30 hours without sleep, and when Kitty is distracted, he falls soundly asleep. The nearest Miss Kitty gets to being married is when she has to pretend to be married to Cavalry Sgt. Holly to save her from a robber gang (\"Sergeant Holly\", 1970). By the time of the \"Gold Train\" episode, Kitty remembers when she first met Matt – 17 years before. Miss Kitty was written out in 1974. The actress said she was tired and quit to protect the cast and crew she loved so much.\nWhen Blake decided not to return for the show's 20th (and final) season, the character was said to have returned to New Orleans. She was replaced by the hoarse-voiced, matronly actress Fran Ryan (known to many as the second Doris Ziffel on CBS's \"Green Acres\".)\n\nFor over a decade on television, a sign hung over Doc's office that read \"Dr. G. Adams\". Milburn Stone was given free rein to choose the character's first name. The actor chose the name of the ancient Greek physician and medical researcher Galen. He is first referred to in this manner by Theodore Bikel as \"Martin Kellums\" in the season-10 episode, \"Song for Dying\", aired February 13, 1965.\n\nDifferences were noted between the characters on the radio and TV versions of \"Gunsmoke.\" In the radio series, Doc was acerbic, somewhat mercenary, and borderline alcoholic, at least in the program's early years. On radio's \"Gunsmoke\", Doc Adams's real name was Dr. Calvin Moore. He came west and changed his name to escape a charge of murder. The television Doc, though still crusty, was in many ways softer and warmer.\n\nNothing in the radio series suggested that Chester Proudfoot was disabled; this merely visual feature was added to the Chester Goode character on television because of actor Dennis Weaver's athletic build, to emphasize Chester's role as a follower and not an independent agent.\n\nMiss Kitty, who after the radio series ended, was said by some to have engaged in prostitution, began in that role in the television series, working in the Long Branch Saloon. In an earlier 1956 episode (\"How to Cure a Friend\", season two, episode seven), the owner of the Long Branch was named Bill Pence (a role played by at least three different actors over the years). A later episode (\"Daddy O\", Season two, episode 36, filmed in 1956 and aired in 1957) begins with Chester pointing out to Matt (who had been out of town) a new sign under the Long Branch Saloon sign saying \"Russell & Pence, Proprietors\". In that same episode, John Dehner portrayed a dubious New Orleans businessman claiming to be Kitty's father, who tried to talk her into selling her half interest in the Long Branch and returning to New Orleans with him as a partner in his alleged freight business. In another 1956 episode (involving a new saloon girl named \"Rena Decker\", who causes four deaths by provoking men into fighting over her), Miss Kitty identifies herself as half-owner of the Long Branch with Mr. Pence (played by Judson Pratt). Subsequently, Miss Kitty transitioned to sole owner. Although early film episodes showed her descending from her second-floor rooms in the saloon with Matt, or showed her or one of her girls leading a cowboy up to those same rooms, these scenes disappeared later on, and viewers were guided to see Miss Kitty just as a kindhearted businesswoman.\n\nFrom 1955 to 1961, \"Gunsmoke\" was a half-hour show (retitled \"Marshal Dillon\" in syndication). It then went to an hour-long format. The series was retitled \"Gun Law\" in the UK. The \"Marshal Dillon\" syndicated rerun lasted from 1961 until 1964 on CBS, originally on Tuesday nights within its time in reruns.\n\n\"Gunsmoke\" was TV's number one-ranked show from 1957 to 1961 before slipping into a decline after expanding to an hour. In 1967, the show's 12th season, CBS planned to cancel the series, but widespread viewer reaction (including a mention in Congress and the behind-the-scenes pressure from Babe Paley, the wife of CBS's longtime president William S. Paley) prevented its demise. On the Biography Channel's \"Behind The Scenes: Gilligan's Island\" (2002), \"Gilligan's Island\" producer Sherwood Schwartz states that Babe pressured her husband not to cancel \"Gunsmoke\" in 1967, so the network cut \"Gilligan's Island\" instead. The show continued in its new time slot at 8 pm on Mondays. This scheduling move led to a spike in ratings that had it once again rally to the top 10 in the Nielsen ratings, which again saved the series when CBS purged most of its rural content in 1971. The series remained in the top 10 until the 1973–74 television season. In September 1975, despite still ranking among the top-30 programs in the ratings, \"Gunsmoke\" was cancelled after a 20-year run; it was replaced by \"Mary Tyler Moore\" spin-offs \"Rhoda\" and \"Phyllis\" (though \"Rhoda\" actually debuted while \"Gunsmoke\" was still airing first-run). Thirty TV Westerns came and went during its 20-year tenure, and \"Gunsmoke\" was the sole survivor, with \"Alias Smith and Jones\" and \"Bonanza\" both leaving the airwaves 2 1/2 years earlier in January 1973.\nArness and Stone remained with the show for its entire run, though Stone missed seven episodes in 1971 due to illness.\n\nThe entire cast was stunned by the cancellation, as they were unaware that CBS was considering it. According to Arness, \"We didn't do a final, wrap-up show. We finished the 20th year, we all expected to go on for another season, or two or three. The (network) never told anybody they were thinking of canceling.\" The cast and crew read the news in the trade papers. This seemed to have been a habit of CBS. Three other popular shows, \"Gilligan's Island\", \"Lost in Space\", and \"The Incredible Hulk\" met the same fate, in the same, abrupt manner.\n\nIn 1987, CBS commissioned a reunion movie entitled \"\". James Arness and Amanda Blake returned in their iconic roles of Matt Dillon and Miss Kitty, with Fran Ryan returning in her role as Kitty's friend/saloon-owner Hannah and Buck Taylor returning as Newly O'Brian. Doc Adams and Festus Haggen were not featured in the film. Milburn Stone had died 7 years earlier in 1980 and the role of Doc was not recast. Ken Curtis, meanwhile, balked at the salary offer he received and said that he should be paid based on Festus' importance in the character hierarchy. The screenwriters responded to Curtis' absence by making Newly the new Dodge City marshal. The film, shot in Alberta, featured a now-retired Marshal Dillon being attacked and a vengeful former rival returning to Dodge City to entrap him.\n\nIn 1990, the second telefilm, \"Gunsmoke: The Last Apache\", premiered. Since Amanda Blake had died the year before, the writers decided to revisit a 1973 episode for the movie. The episode was based on \"Matt's Love Story\", which was noted for the marshal's first overnight visit to a female's lodgings. In the episode, Matt loses his memory and his heart during a brief liaison with \"Mike\" Yardner (played by Michael Learned). In the film, Learned returns as Mike, who reveals to Marshal Dillon that he is the father of their daughter. Beth (played by Amy Stock-Poynton) and asks him for help in saving her. Dodge City was never again seen.\n\nOther films included \"\" (1992), \"\" (1993), and \"Gunsmoke: One Man's Justice\" (1994). Arness appeared in all five films.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll 635 episodes of the television series, and almost all 480 episodes of the radio show, still exist.\n\nIn syndication, the entire 20-year run of \"Gunsmoke\" is separated into three packages by CBS Television Distribution:\n\nIn 2006, as part of \"Gunsmoke\"s 50th anniversary on TV, certain selected episodes were released on DVD in three different box sets. Twelve episodes, from 1955 to 1964, were selected for the \"Gunsmoke: Volume I\" box set, and another twelve episodes, from 1964 to 1975, were selected for the \"Gunsmoke: Volume II\" box set. Both sets are also available as a combined single \"Gift Box Set\". A third unique DVD box set, known as \"Gunsmoke: The Directors Collection\", was also released with 10 selected episodes from certain seasons throughout the series' 20-year history. All of these box sets are available on Region 1 DVD from Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD.\n\nAdditionally, Paramount Home Entertainment and CBS DVD have released the first 17 seasons (seasons one to six are known as the \"half-hour years\") on DVD in Region 1. Seasons 18 and 19 will be released on February 11, 2020. All DVDs have been released with English audio and close captioning from season 1 to 5 and starting season 6 English SDH.\n\n\n\n\n\nPreceding the series by nearly 2 years was a 1953 movie also titled Gunsmoke. It has been confused in the past as the basis for the series but has been proven since to have no connection with the show, or radio series, with the exception that all are westerns.\n\n\n\"Gunsmoke\" had one spin-off series, \"Dirty Sally\", a semicomedy starring Jeanette Nolan as an old woman and Dack Rambo as a young gunfighter, leaving Dodge City for California to pan for gold. The program lasted 13 weeks and aired in the first half of 1974, a year before \"Gunsmoke\" ended.\n\n\nThe \"Gunsmoke\" radio theme song and later TV theme was titled \"Old Trails\", also known as \"Boothill\". The \"Gunsmoke\" theme was composed by Rex Koury. The original radio version was conducted by Koury. The TV version was thought to have been first conducted by CBS west coast music director Lud Gluskin. The lyrics of the theme, never aired on the radio or television show, were recorded and released by Tex Ritter in 1955. Ritter was backed on that Capitol record by Rex Koury and the radio \"Gunsmoke\" orchestra.
